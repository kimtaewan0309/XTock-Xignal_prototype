Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Refer to the section below entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained below and throughout this quarterly report. Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\"), we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Please see \"Non-GAAP Disclosures\" at the end of this Item 2 for further detail on these financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends."
