  "summary": "ITEM 2 — MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements. Dollar amounts are stated in millions except for share and per share amounts and where otherwise noted. All historical common stock share and per share information in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split effective at the close of business on May 21, 2025. Percentage and dollar change calculations, which are based on non-rounded dollar values, may not be able to be recalculated using the dollar values in this document due to the rounding of those dollar values. References to daily sales rate (DSR) change may reflect either growth (positive) or contraction (negative) for the applicable period."
