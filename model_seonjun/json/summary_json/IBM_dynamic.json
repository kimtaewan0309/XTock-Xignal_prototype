MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2025 Snapshot Organization of Information: In September 2024, the IBM Qualified Personal Pension Plan (\"Qualified PPP\") irrevocably transferred to an insurer approximately $6 billion of the Qualified PPP’s Defined Benefit pension obligations and related plan assets. As a result of this transaction, the company recognized a pension settlement charge of $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax) in the third quarter of 2024, primarily related to the accelerated recognition of accumulated actuarial losses of the plans. As the charge was non-operating and non-cash, it did not impact our operating (non-GAAP) earnings or cash flow results. Refer to note U, “Retirement-Related Benefits,” in the company's 2024 Annual Report for additional information."
