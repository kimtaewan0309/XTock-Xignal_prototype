  "summary": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Updated Financial Metrics We have updated the title of our primary non-GAAP measure to “Adjusted EBITDA” from our previous title “Adjusted Operating Income.” We believe this updated title better aligns with our peers. Numerically, Adjusted EBITDA is the same as Adjusted Operating Income; however the starting point of the reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure has changed from operating income to net income. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for the full definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income attributable to Match Group, Inc. shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA."
