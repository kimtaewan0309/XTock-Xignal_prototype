Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency's future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results, are \"forward-looking statements\" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"guidance,\" and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements."
