  "summary": "Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Due to changing market conditions, we are experiencing, and may continue to experience, lower market demand for our products. We have been experiencing, and may continue to experience, elevated commodity and other input costs, as well as employee-related cost inflation. Additionally, we have been experiencing, and may continue to experience, significantly higher costs to us, principally in our Plumbing Products segment, due to the recently announced and enacted tariffs, particularly those related to China. We seek to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs and other unfavorable impact to our costs over time with pricing, cost savings initiatives, sourcing changes, and other activities."
