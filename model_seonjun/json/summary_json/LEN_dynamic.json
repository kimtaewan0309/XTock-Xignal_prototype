  "summary": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2024 Form 10-K. Outlook Our third quarter results reflect the continued softening of market conditions and affordability challenges against the backdrop of what might be the beginnings of an improving economic landscape for the housing market. While our deliveries were just below our goal and we sold more homes than expected during the quarter, it was at the expense of margin deterioration. Sales volume was difficult to maintain and required additional incentives in order to achieve our expected pace and avoid a buildup of excess inventory."
