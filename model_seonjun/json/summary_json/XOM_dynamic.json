MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview During the third quarter of 2025, the price of crude oil increased slightly relative to second quarter 2025, remaining near the middle of the 10-year historical range (2010-2019) supported by strong demand despite increased OPEC+ supply. Natural gas prices remained at the top of the 10-year range on robust global demand. Global industry refining margins moved toward the top of the 10-year historical range in the third quarter, impacted by industry supply outages coupled with strong demand. Chemical margins remained at bottom of cycle, well below the 10-year range, with continued industry oversupply."
