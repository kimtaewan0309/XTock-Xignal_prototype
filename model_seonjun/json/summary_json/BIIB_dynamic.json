  "summary": "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report and elsewhere in this report, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such statements. The factors identified above should not be construed as an exhaustive list of factors that could affect our future results and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in our 2024 Form 10-K. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events and you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties."
