  "summary": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS In December 2024, Old Aptiv (as defined below), a public limited company formed under the laws of Jersey on May 19, 2011, completed its previously announced reorganization transaction (the “Transaction,” or the “reorganization transaction”), in which Old Aptiv established a new publicly-listed Jersey parent company, Aptiv Holdings Limited (“New Aptiv”), which is resident for tax purposes in Switzerland. As a result of the Transaction, all issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Old Aptiv were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued ordinary shares of New Aptiv. Following consummation of the Transaction, holders of Old Aptiv shares became ordinary shareholders of New Aptiv, Old Aptiv became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv and New Aptiv was renamed “Aptiv PLC.” The previous publicly-listed Jersey parent company, which was an Irish tax resident, is referred to as “Old Aptiv” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. New Aptiv’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “APTV,” the same symbol under which the Old Aptiv shares were previously listed."
