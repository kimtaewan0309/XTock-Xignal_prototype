Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, contain statements concerning potential future events. Such forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions by management, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by the Company. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such words as \"future\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", “estimates”, “would”, “could”, “can”, “may,” or other similar words or other comparable terms. If any of the Company’s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements."
