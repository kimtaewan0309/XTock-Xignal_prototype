Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Review — Results of Operations Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of healthcare products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition, and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The following tables detail sales by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30."
