  "summary": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Williams-Sonoma, Inc., (the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) incorporated in 1973, is an omni-channel specialty retailer of high-quality products for the home. In 1956, our founder, Chuck Williams, turned a passion for cooking and eating with friends into a small business with a big idea. He opened a store in Sonoma, California to sell the French cookware that intrigued him while visiting Europe but that could not be found in America. Chuck’s business, which set a standard for customer service, took off and helped fuel a revolution in American cooking and entertaining that continues today."
