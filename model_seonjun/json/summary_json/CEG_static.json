  "summary": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS General On February 21, 2021, the Board of Directors of Exelon Corporation (“Exelon”) authorized management to pursue a plan to separate its competitive generation and customer-facing energy businesses, conducted through Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (“Constellation”, formerly Exelon Generation Company, LLC) and its subsidiaries, into an independent, publicly traded company. Constellation Energy Corporation (“CEG Parent” or the “Company”), a Pennsylvania corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon, was newly formed for the purpose of separation and had not engaged in any activities except in preparation for the distribution. On February 1, 2022, Exelon completed the separation by distributing all the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, on a pro rata basis to the holders of Exelon’s common stock, with the Company holding all the interests in Constellation previously held by Exelon (the \"Separation\"). As of 2002, Constellation has been an individual registrant since the registration of their public debt securities under the Securities Act."
