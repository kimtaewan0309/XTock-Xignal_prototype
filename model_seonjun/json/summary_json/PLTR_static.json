  "summary": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale. We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data. We have built four principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham (“Gotham”), Palantir Foundry (“Foundry”), Palantir Apollo (“Apollo”), and Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (“AIP”)."
