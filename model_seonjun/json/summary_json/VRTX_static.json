BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. We have seven approved medicines: five that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (“CF”), a life-threatening genetic disease, one that treats severe sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”), life shortening inherited blood disorders, and one that treats moderate-to-severe acute pain. Our clinical-stage pipeline includes programs in CF, SCD, beta thalassemia, acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, IgA nephropathy and other autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, type 1 diabetes, myotonic dystrophy type 1, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Our goal in CF is to continue to extend our leadership by developing treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with CF."
