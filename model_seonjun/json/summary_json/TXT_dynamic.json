  "summary": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Environment Changes to the United States trade policy have resulted in new or higher tariffs on goods imported from numerous countries, and some countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports from the United States. We are principally a North American manufacturer and 71% of our 2024 revenues were generated in the U.S. Our aircraft products, subassemblies, parts and components manufactured in Canada and Mexico are largely qualified under the rules of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) for preferential treatment on tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canada and Mexico imports."
