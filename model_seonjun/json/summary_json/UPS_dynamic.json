  "summary": "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We continue to execute our Customer First, People Led and Innovation Driven strategy to grow in the most attractive parts of the market including healthcare, small and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") and International. During the third quarter and first nine months ( the \"year-to-date\") periods of 2025, we took several steps in furtherance of this strategy, including continuing our deliberate shift in our business to increase our focus on higher yielding volume. As previously disclosed, we intend to reduce volume from our largest customer by more than 50% by June 2026 from 2024 levels. In the first half of 2025, we insourced our former SurePost product, using the UPS network for final mile delivery, and have since replaced it with Ground Saver, a new domestic economy service meant to complement our array of products used by our customers."
