  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS \nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as otherwise noted by the context, the terms \"DuPont\" or \"Company\" used herein mean DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nDuPont is a Delaware corporation formed in 2015 (formerly, DowDuPont Inc.), for the purpose of effecting an all-stock merger of equals transactions between The Dow Chemical Company (\"TDCC\") and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (\"EID\"). Effective August 31, 2017, pursuant to the merger of equals transaction contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017 (\"DWDP Merger Agreement\"), TDCC and EID each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont Inc. (\"DowDuPont\") and, as a result, TDCC and EID became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the \"DWDP Merger\"). Prior to the DWDP Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the DWDP Merger Agreement. For purposes of DowDuPont's financial statement presentation, TDCC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the DWDP Merger and EID's assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value as of the DWDP Merger Effectiveness Time. \nOn April 1, 2019, the Company completed the separation of the materials science business through the spin-off of Dow Inc., (“Dow”) including Dow’s subsidiary TDCC (the “Dow Distribution”). On June 1, 2019, the Company completed the separation of the agriculture business through the spin-off of Corteva, Inc. (“Corteva”) including Corteva’s subsidiary EID, (the “Corteva Distribution\" and together with the Dow Distribution, the “DWDP Distributions”). Effective January 1, 2023, Corteva’s subsidiary EID changed its name to EIDP, Inc. (“EIDP”), and therefore references to EID reflect this name change as appropriate. \nDuPont is a global innovation leader with technology-based materials and solutions that help transform industries and everyday life by applying diverse science and expertise to help customers advance their best ideas and deliver essential innovations in key markets including electronics, transportation, construction, water, healthcare and worker safety.

(“IFF”) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “N&B Transaction”) that resulted in IFF issuing shares to DuPont stockholders. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOn February 18, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered an agreement on February 17, 2022, (the \"Transaction Agreement\") with Celanese Corporation (\"Celanese\") for divestiture of the majority of DuPont’s historic Mobility & Materials (“M&M”) segment, (the “M&M Divestiture”). The Auto Adhesives & Fluids, Multibase\nTM\n and Tedlar® product line, which were part of the historic M&M segment, are referred to as the \"Retained Businesses\". On November 1, 2022, DuPont and Celanese completed the M&M Divestiture and DuPont received cash proceeds of $11 billion which was subject to transaction adjustments in accordance with the Transaction Agreement. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \nAs part of its announcement on February 18, 2022 regarding the M&M Divestiture, DuPont also announced the Board of Directors' approval for the divestiture of the Delrin® acetal homopolymer (H-POM) business (the \"Delrin® Divestiture\"). On November 1, 2023, the Company closed the sale of the Delrin® business to TJC LP (\"TJC\"), (the “Delrin® Divestiture”). The Delrin® Divestiture together with the M&M Divestiture, are referred to as the “M&M Divestitures”.\nIntended Electronics Separation\nOn May 22, 2024, DuPont announced a plan to separate each of its Electronics and Water businesses in a tax-free manner to its shareholders, (the “Previously Intended Business Separations”). On January 15, 2025, DuPont announced it is targeting November 1, 2025, for the completion of the intended separation of the Electronics business (the “Intended Electronics Separation”). DuPont also announced that it would retain the Water business. The Intended Electronics Separation will not require a shareholder vote and is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval by DuPont's Board of Directors, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, applicable regulatory approvals and satisfactory completion of financing. \n6\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Flexibility and Return of Excess Capital\nFollowing the M&M Divestiture, in November 2022, DuPont redeemed in full $2.5 billion in fixed-rate long term senior unsecured notes due November 2023. Following the announcement of the Previously Intended Business Separations, in the second quarter 2024, DuPont completed a partial redemption of $650 million aggregate principal amount of its 2038 Notes and entered into two forward-starting fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements (“2024 Swaps”) to hedge the changes in the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt due to interest rate change movements. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, DuPont's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase and retirement of up to $5 billion of common stock, (the \"$5B Share Buyback Program”). In the third quarter 2023, the Company completed the repurchase and retired a total of 46.8 million shares of common stock with $250 million of such repurchases completing the $1 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2022 and the remaining $3 billion under the $5B Share Buyback Program. \nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the remaining $2 billion of buyback authority under the $5B Share Buyback Program repurchasing 27.9 million shares. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase and retirement of up to $1 billion of common stock (the \"$1B Share Buyback Program”). The $1B Share Buyback Program terminates on June 30, 2025, unless extended or shortened by the Board of Directors.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, DuPont completed an accelerated stock repurchase transaction (“ASR\") for the repurchase of about $500 million of common stock. In total, the Company repurchased 6.9 million shares at an average price of $71.96 per share under the transaction. In connection with the Previously Intended Business Separations and continuing in light of the Intended Electronics Separation, DuPont announced its intent not to complete the remaining $500 million in share buyback authority under the $1B Share Buyback Program. \nFor more information, see the discussion of Liquidity & Capital Resources in See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTargeted Acquisitions\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Spectrum Plastics Group (“Spectrum”) from AEA Investors (the “Spectrum Acquisition”) which is part of Industrial Solutions within the Electronics & Industrial segment.\nOn July 28, 2024, DuPont completed the acquisition of Donatelle Plastics, LLC (\"Donatelle Plastics\"), (the \"Donatelle Plastics Acquisition\"), which is being integrated into Industrial Solutions within the Electronics & Industrial segment. \nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWater District Settlement Agreement\nIn April 2024, the $1.185B Water District Settlement became final and therefore DuPont’s $400 million contribution, plus interest, to the Water District Settlement Fund is reflected as a cash outflow within cash flows from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024.

The markets in which the Company participates compete primarily through technology, range of products and services, performance, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, service and support. The Company provides extensive support, technical services and testing services for its customers, in addition to new product development. The Company believes that its proprietary product and process technologies, robust product and application development pipelines, customer intimacy, global manufacturing capability and local service capability enable it to compete successfully.\nDuPont is a multi-industrial company and is subject to competition across all product and service areas. Key competitors include but are not limited to:\n•\nElectronics & Industrial:\n Element Solutions, Entegris, Fujifilm, Henkel, JSR, Merck KGaA, MKS Instruments, and Resonac.\n•\nWater & Protection:\n 3M, Honeywell, Hydranautics, Kingspan, Kolon, Lanxess, Owens-Corning, Ecolab, Avient, Toray, Teijin, and Yantai.\nAgainst this competitive backdrop, value-in-use is the primary driver of price for the Company’s products, although price is impacted by many factors including, among others, fluctuations in supply and demand, and availability and cost of key manufacturing inputs including raw materials and energy. \nSOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MAJOR RAW MATERIALS\nThe Company uses a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacturing of products. The prices of raw materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. The Company actively works to mitigate impacts of such conditions. \nDISTRIBUTION\nMost products are marketed primarily through the Company's sales organization, although for some product lines, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The Company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the Company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the Company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world.\nBACKLOG \nIn general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are typically based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. However, from time to time in limited instances the Company does operate against a backlog for certain products, which has in the past resulted, and in the future may result, from the availability of raw materials from third-party suppliers. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is generally not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.\nSEASONALITY\nCertain of the Company's sales are seasonal as consumer electronics and North American and European construction end-market demand generally increases in the second and third fiscal quarters resulting in sales increases in Interconnect Solutions and Shelter Solutions, respectively. This seasonality is partially mitigated by the other products provided by the Company that have no material seasonal effect.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe Company’s businesses differentially manage their respective intellectual property estates to support Company strategic priorities, which can include leveraging intellectual property within and across product lines. \n12\nTable of Contents\nTrade Secrets:\n Trade secrets are an important part of the Company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the Company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the Company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the Company and/or unjust enrichment.\nPatents:\n The Company applies for and obtains patents in many countries, including the U.S., and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company in the aggregate. The Company considers various intellectual property protections and strategic business priorities when deciding whether to apply for or maintain a patent.\nThe protection afforded by patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country and type of patent protection. The term of these patents is approximately twenty years from the filing date in general, but varies depending on country and type of patent protection. DuPont's significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the Company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2024, the Company owned about 12,800 patents and patent applications globally. Approximately 80 percent of the Company’s patent estate has a remaining term of more than 5 years.\nTrademarks:\n The Company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or the product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.\nENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY MATTERS\nDuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. For more information see: (1) Environmental Proceedings on page \n30\n, (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page \n37\n, (3) Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSUSTAINABILITY \nDuPont’s purpose is to empower the world with the essential innovations to thrive. The Company operates within four core values of protecting safety and health; respect for people; conduct in accordance with the highest ethical behavior; and protecting the planet. DuPont’s sustainability strategy is focused on driving innovations to create sustainable solutions that help address the most pressing challenges facing society and the planet; enhancing the sustainability of its operations and facilities; and protecting the health and well-being of its employees and communities. DuPont believes that climate change is an important global environmental issue that presents risks and opportunities. The Company is continuously evaluating opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy.\nInformation about DuPont’s sustainability-related policies, programs, initiatives and goals is available under Sustainability in the \"About Us\" section of its website. The Company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, which is aligned to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") frameworks, includes information based on the businesses and facilities owned and operated by the Company during the calendar year 2023. \nAdditional corporate governance information, including DuPont’s amended and restated charter, amended and restated bylaws, corporate governance guidelines, Board committee charters, and code of business conduct and ethics, is available under Corporate Governance in the \"For Investors\" section of the Company’s website. Nothing on the DuPont websites shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nF\noundational to the Company’s current and future success is its employees, who drive the Company’s strategic vision, manage operations and develop products. The Company focuses significant attention on attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels. Through training and professional development initiatives, promoting a respectful and welcoming culture, and emphasizing the importance of health, safety and well-being, the Company’s aim is to create an environment that fully supports the needs of its employees providing opportunity for financial and career growth, an inclusive and collegial experience and purpose in doing work that matters.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is committed to upholding a workplace culture that prioritizes the wellbeing and fulfillment of our employees and strongly believes that this approach not only aligns with our values but also positively impacts our long-term performance. To ensure that the Company is consistently fulfilling this commitment, DuPont regularly gathers feedback from our colleagues and analyzes our progress. Annually, an enterprise-wide engagement survey is conducted, which provides insight into employee morale and aspects of workplace culture like core values, commitment to ethical behavior, teamwork and employee development. \nThe Company is committed to creating a high-performance culture built on continual learning to support the strategic needs of its workforce. The professional growth of our people is essential to the growth of our business. Our annual goal process asks employees to not only identify three key goals around business contributions but also and one goal focused on self-development. The Company has prioritized learning and career development opportunities for leaders and all employees. The Company offers a wide set of training, education and development opportunities, both formally and informally, throughout the year. All employees take part in a mix of on-the-job training and appropriate learning and training opportunities focusing on topics that are the most critical and relevant to each employees’ job function. Employees have the freedom to create meaningful development plans, identify goals, and take steps to achieve them. \nThe Company is committed to ensuring fair access to growth and fulfillment opportunities for its employees and to positively impacting communities in which it operates. In furtherance of these commitments, the Company supports several employee-led resource groups which are open to all employees.\nOrganizational culture is only as strong and resilient as its leaders; therefore, DuPont invests in leadership development. DuPont provides programming to equip leaders with the skills needed to support our employees through effective leadership. Annually, our senior leadership identifies key talent based on performance, potential and aspiration to develop for advancement. \nThe Company's success also depends on the well-being of employees, including physical, mental and emotional health. DuPont employees have access to online health resources through our global wellness provider to help them improve their overall well-being, including a health assessment, healthy habit building and tracking, videos and content to reduce stress and increase resilience, better sleep habits, nutrition guides, company wellness challenges, and financial wellness education. The Company continues to provide no-cost Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") services to all employees globally and their immediate household members. All employees also have the support of the Company’s Health Services teams, which provides onsite and intranet-based services to support and monitor the health and welfare of employees. The Company’s larger manufacturing and research sites have onsite clinics where employees can get occupational care, first aid treatment, travel vaccinations and referrals for off-site medical care. The Company continuously strives for zero workplace injuries, occupational illnesses and incidents. The Company’s safety metrics are continually measured against this goal, and DuPont’s Environmental, Health, Safety & Sustainability Committee oversees improvements in the Company's health and safety practices. Health Services also assesses health risks across DuPont to find out which health concerns are most important to the Company's employees, conducts medical surveillance exams based on occupational risks and regulatory compliance priorities flagged by DuPont’s Environmental, Health and Safety team. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company employed\n \napproximately 24,000 people worldwide. Approximately 34 percent of employees were in Asia Pacific, 16 percent were in the EMEA, 5 percent were in Latin America and 45 percent were in the U.S and Canada.

The Company continually assesses its liquidity position, including possible sources of incremental liquidity, in light of the current economic environment, capital market conditions and Company performance.\nIntended Electronics Separation\nOn May 22, 2024, DuPont announced a plan to separate each of its Electronics and Water businesses in a tax-free manner to its shareholders, (the “Previously Intended Business Separations”). On January 15, 2025, DuPont announced it is targeting November 1, 2025, for the completion of the intended separation of the Electronics business (the “Intended Electronics Separation”). DuPont also announced that it would retain the Water business. The Intended Electronics Separation will not require a shareholder vote and is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval by DuPont's Board of Directors, receipt of tax opinion from counsel, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, applicable regulatory approvals and satisfactory completion of financing. \nMobility & Materials Divestitures\nOn November 1, 2022, (the \"Transaction Date\") DuPont completed the previously announced divestiture of the majority of the historic Mobility & Materials segment, including the Engineering Polymers business line and select product lines within the Advanced Solutions and Performance Resins business lines (the “M&M Divestiture”). The Company had previously entered into a Transaction Agreement (the \"Transaction Agreement\") with Celanese Corporation (\"Celanese\") on February 17, 2022 for a purchase price of $11.0 billion in cash. Cash received on the Transaction Date, as adjusted for preliminary and other adjustments was $11.0 billion. These adjustments include approximately $0.5 billion of cash transferred with the M&M Divestiture for which DuPont was reimbursed at closing resulting in net proceeds of $10.5 billion.\nOn February 18, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved of the divestiture of the Delrin® acetal homopolymer (H-POM) business (the \"Delrin® Divestiture\"). On November 1, 2023, the Company closed the sale of the Delrin® business to TJC LP (\"TJC\"), (the “Delrin® Divestiture”). DuPont received cash proceeds of approximately $1.28 billion, which includes certain customary transaction adjustments, a note receivable of $350 million and acquired a 19.9 percent non-controlling equity interest in Derby Group Holdings LLC, (“Derby”). The customary transaction adjustments related to $27 million of cash transferred with the Delrin® Divestiture for which DuPont was reimbursed at closing resulting in net cash proceeds of $1.25 billion. TJC, through its subsidiaries, holds the 80.1 percent controlling interest in Derby. The Delrin® Divestiture together with the M&M Divestiture (collectively the \"M&M Divestitures\" and the businesses in scope for the M&M Divestitures collectively the \"M&M Businesses\") represent a strategic shift that has a major impact on DuPont's operations and results.\nThe results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 present the financial results of the Delrin® Divestiture through the November 1, 2023 transaction date, as discontinued operations. In the comparative period, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 present the financial results of the M&M Businesses as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present the cash flows of the Delrin® Divestiture as \n33\nTable of Contents\ndiscontinued operations. In the comparative period, the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 present the financial results of the M&M Businesses as discontinued operations. The comprehensive income of the M&M Businesses have not been segregated and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, respectively, for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements refer only to DuPont's continuing operations and do not include discussion of balances or activity of the M&M Businesses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Auto Adhesives & Fluids, Multibase\nTM\n and Tedlar® product lines, previously reported within the historic Mobility & Materials segment, (the \"Retained Businesses\") were not included in the scope of the M&M Divestitures. The Retained Businesses are included in Corporate & Other.\nDonatelle Plastics Acquisition\nOn July 28, 2024, DuPont completed the acquisition of Donatelle Plastics, LLC (\"Donatelle Plastics\"), for a net purchase price of $365 million (the \"Donatelle Plastics Acquisition\") which includes immaterial adjustments for acquired cash and net working capital. The net purchase price also includes the estimated fair value for a contingent earn-out liability of $40 million. Donatelle Plastics is a medical device company specializing in the design, development and manufacture of medical components and devices. Donatelle Plastics part of Industrial Solutions within the Electronics & Industrial segment. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSpectrum Acquisition\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Spectrum Plastics Group (“Spectrum”) from AEA Investors (the “Spectrum Acquisition”). Spectrum manufactures flexible packaging products, plastic and silicone extrusions, and components for the industrial, food and medical business sectors throughout the United States and international markets. Spectrum is part of the Electronics & Industrial segment. The net purchase price was approximately $1,781 million, including a net upward adjustment of approximately $43 million for acquired cash and net working capital, among other items. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTerminated Intended Rogers Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company announced the termination of the previously announced agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Rogers Corporation (“Rogers”) as DuPont and Rogers were unable to obtain timely clearance from all the required regulators (\"Terminated Intended Rogers Corporation Acquisition\").\nOther Divestitures \nIn May 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Biomaterials business unit, which included the Company's equity method investment in DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Products, to the Huafon Group. Total consideration received related to the sale was approximately $240 million. In May 2022, a pre-tax gain of $26 million ($21 million net of tax) was recorded in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The results of operations of the Biomaterials business unit are reported in Corporate & Other for 2022.\n34\nTable of Contents\nANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS \nJoint Settlement Agreement\nOn January 22, 2021, the Company, Corteva, EIDP and Chemours entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”), pursuant to which the parties have agreed to share certain costs associated with potential future liabilities related to alleged historical releases of certain PFAS arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (“eligible PFAS costs”) until the earlier to occur of (i) December 31, 2040, (ii) the day on which the aggregate amount of qualified spend (as defined in the MOU) is equal to $4 billion or (iii) a termination in accordance with the terms of the MOU. The parties have agreed that, during the term of this sharing arrangement, Chemours will bear 50 percent of any qualified spend and the Company and Corteva shall together bear 50 percent of any qualified spend. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has recorded an indemnification liability of $222 million in connection with the cost sharing arrangement related to future eligible PFAS costs.\nTotal pre-tax charges of $46 million, $487 million and $96 million related to the MOU are reflected as a loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe increase in pre-tax charges for the year ended December 31, 2023, are primarily driven by the definitive agreement reached in June 2023 by Chemours, Corteva, EIDP and DuPont to comprehensively resolve all PFAS-related claims of a defined class of U.S. public water systems, (the “Water District Settlement Agreement”) for $1.185 billion in cash to be paid to a Qualified Settlement Fund, (the “Water District Settlement Fund”). DuPont’s contribution of $400 million to the Water District Settlement Fund was made in the third quarter 2023 and is reflected in “Restricted cash and cash equivalents “on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s total contribution, including interest, of $408 million has been removed from \"Restricted cash and cash equivalents - current\" along with the associated \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, as the settlement became final in the second quarter 2024.\nSee Note 16\n \nof the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDividends\n \nDuring 2024, the Board of Directors authorized and paid quarterly dividends of $0.38 per share to shareholders of record in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.\nShare Buyback Program\nThe Company completed its share buyback programs that were open in 2022 and 2023. \nIn the first quarter 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase and retirement of up to $1 billion of common stock (the \"$1B Share Buyback Program”). Under the $1B Share Buyback Program, repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions off market, including additional ASR agreements in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The $1B Program terminates on June 30, 2025, unless extended or shortened by the Board of Directors.\nIn the first half of 2024, the Company entered and completed a $500 million ASR transaction under the $1B Share Buyback Program. In total, the Company repurchased 6.9 million shares at an average price of $71.96 per share under the Q1 2024 ASR Transaction. In connection with the Previously Intended Separations and continuing in light of the Intended Electronics Separation, DuPont announced its intent not to complete the remaining $500 million in share buyback authority under the $1B Share Buyback program. See the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources starting on page \n47\n for more information.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1 percent nondeductible excise tax imposed on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The net value is determined by the fair market value of the stock repurchased during the tax year, reduced by the fair market value of stock issued during the tax year. The Company recorded total excise tax of $8 million and $21 million, respectively, as a reduction to retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, reflected within stockholders' equity and a corresponding liability within \"Accounts Payable\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements \nIn the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements (\"2022 Swaps\") with an aggregate notional principal amount totaling $1 billion to hedge changes in the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt due to interest rate change movements. These swaps converted $1 billion of the Company’s $1.65 billion principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2038 into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through 2032 with an interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). Under the terms of the agreements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, fixed for floating interest amounts based on the agreed upon notional principal amount. The 2022 Swaps expire on November 15, 2032 and are carried at fair value.\nSince inception of the 2022 Swaps, fair value hedge accounting has been applied and thus, changes in the fair value of the 2022 Swaps and changes in the fair value of the related hedged portion of long-term debt were presented and net to zero in \"Sundry income (expense) – net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. On June 5, 2024, DuPont issued a notice of redemption to the bond trustee with respect to a partial redemption of $650 million aggregate principal amount of its 2038 Notes in accordance with their terms. The redemption was effective on June 15, 2024. As a result of the announced redemption, the Company dedesignated the then current hedging relationship. At the time of dedesignation, the total amount recorded as a cumulative fair value basis adjustment on the 2038 Notes was a loss of $81 million of which $32 million was recognized as a component of the loss from partial extinguishment of debt. The remaining basis adjustment is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the 2038 Notes. The basis adjustment amortization for the year December 31, 2024 was $1 million. Refer to Note 15 for additional details on the partial redemption of the 2038 Notes.\nIn June 2024, the Company entered into two forward-starting fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements (“2024 Swaps”) to hedge the changes in the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt due to interest rate change movements. One swap converted $2.15 billion principal amount of the fixed rate notes due 2048 into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms from 2025 through 2048 with an interest rate based on SOFR. The other swap converted $1 billion principal amount of the 2038 Notes into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms from 2032 through 2038 with an interest rate based on SOFR. The 2024 Swaps have a mandatory early termination date of December 15, 2025 and are carried at fair value. Fair value hedge accounting has not been applied.\nThe 2022 Swaps and 2024 Swaps are considered economic hedges of the Company’s fixed rate debt. As such, changes in the fair value and gain or loss from net interest settlement of the 2022 Swaps after the date of dedesignation and changes in the fair value of the 2024 Swaps since inception have been recorded in “Sundry income (expense) – net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amount charged related to interest rate swaps not designated as hedges was a loss of $138 million and zero for the years December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nRestructuring Programs\n2023-2024 Restructuring Program\nIn December 2023, the Company approved targeted restructuring actions to capture near-term cost reductions due to macroeconomic factors as well as to further simplify certain organizational structures following the Spectrum acquisition and Delrin® Divestiture (the \"2023-2024 Restructuring Program\"). DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge related to the 2023-2024 Restructuring Program in the amount of $199 million inception-to-date, recognized in \"Restructuring and asset related charges - net\" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of $114 million of severance and related benefit costs and asset related charges of $85 million. At December 31, 2024, total liabilities related to the 2023-2024 Restructuring Program were $47 million for severance and related benefit costs, recognized in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n2022 Restructuring Program\nIn October 2022, the Company approved targeted restructuring actions to capture near-term cost reductions and to further simplify certain organizational structures following the M&M Divestitures (the \"2022 Restructuring Program\"). DuPont recorded pre-tax charges related to the 2022 Restructuring Program in the amount of $94 million inception-to-date, recognized in \"Restructuring and asset related charges - net\" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of $80 million of severance and related benefit costs and asset related charges of $14 million. At December 31, 2024, total liabilities related to the 2022 Restructuring Program were $1 million for severance and related benefit costs, recognized in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 2022 Restructuring Program is considered substantially complete.\n36\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSummary of Sales Results\nFor the Years Ended December 31, \nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\n$\n12,386 \n$\n12,068 \n$\n13,017 \nSales Variances by Segment and Geographic Region - As Reported\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nPercentage change from prior year\nLocal Price & Product Mix\nCurrency\nVolume\nPortfolio & Other\nTotal\nLocal Price & Product Mix\nCurrency\nVolume\n \nPortfolio & Other\nTotal\nElectronics & Industrial\n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\n8 \n%\n6 \n%\n11 \n%\n— \n%\n(1)\n%\n(11)\n%\n2 \n%\n(10)\n%\nWater & Protection\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n— \n(4)\n3 \n(1)\n(7)\n— \n(5)\nCorporate & Other \n1\n(1)\n(1)\n(3)\n(1)\n(6)\n1 \n— \n2 \n(7)\n(4)\nTotal\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\n2 \n%\n3 \n%\n3 \n%\n2 \n%\n(1)\n%\n(8)\n%\n— \n%\n(7)\n%\nU.S. & Canada\n— \n%\n— \n%\n(1)\n%\n6 \n%\n5 \n%\n3 \n%\n— \n%\n(9)\n%\n2 \n%\n(4)\n%\nEMEA \n2\n(2)\n— \n(2)\n1 \n(3)\n3 \n1 \n(4)\n— \n— \nAsia Pacific\n(2)\n(2)\n7 \n— \n3 \n— \n(2)\n(11)\n(1)\n(14)\nLatin America\n(1)\n— \n— \n3 \n2 \n1 \n— \n7 \n2 \n10 \nTotal\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\n2 \n%\n3 \n%\n3 \n%\n2 \n%\n(1)\n%\n(8)\n%\n— \n%\n(7)\n%\n1.

Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n \n2024 versus 2023\nThe Company reported net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $12.4 billion, up 3 percent from $12.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to a 2 percent increase in volume and a 3 percent increase in portfolio partially offset by 1 percent decreases due to local price and product mix as well as currency. The volume increase was driven by Electronics & Industrial (up 8 percent) partially offset by Water & Protection (down 2 percent) and Corporate & Other (down 3 percent). Portfolio and other changes increased by 3 percent compared to the same period last year, driven by Electronics & Industrial (up 6 percent), partially offset by Corporate & Other (down 1 percent). Local price and product mix decreased within Electronics & Industrial (down 2 percent), Water & Protection (down 1 percent) and Corporate & Other (down 1 percent). The 1 percent decrease in currency was driven by Asia Pacific (down 2 percent).\n2023 versus 2022\nThe Company reported net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $12.1 billion, down 7 percent from $13.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to an 8 percent decrease in volume and a 1 percent unfavorable currency impact partially offset by a 2 percent increase due to local price and product mix. Volume decrease was driven by Electronics & Industrial (down 11 percent) and Water and Protection (down 7 percent) partially offset by Corporate & Other (up 2 percent). Local price and product mix increased within Water & Protection (up 3 percent) and Corporate & Other (up 1 percent) and remained flat in Electronics & Industrial. Currency was down 1 percent compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by Asia Pacific (down 2 percent) partially offset by EMEA (up 1 percent).\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales was $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, up from $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost of sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to increased sales volume mostly offset by lower raw material, logistics and energy costs.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 64 percent compared with 65 percent for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales was $7.8 billion, down from $8.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cost of sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to decreased sales volume and lower raw material, logistics and energy costs.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 65 percent.\n37\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development Expense (\"R&D\")\nR&D expense was $531 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, up from $508 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $536 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. R&D as a percentage of net sales was 4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nThe increase in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher variable compensation. The decrease in R&D expense in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to lower personnel related expenses partially offset by the Spectrum Acquisition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, SG&A expenses totaled $1,552 million, up from $1,408 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1,467 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13 percent, 12 percent, and 11 percent for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe increase in SG&A cost in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher variable compensation and incremental cost from the Spectrum and Donatelle acquisitions. The decrease in SG&A costs in 2023 compared with 2022 was primarily due to lower Stranded Costs related to the M&M Divestiture, lower personnel related expenses and lower bad debt expense partially offset by the Spectrum Acquisition.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles was $595 million, $600 million and $590 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The slight decrease in amortization of intangibles in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to absence of amortization in 2024 from fully amortized assets. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the Spectrum Acquisition in the third quarter of 2023 partially offset by the absence of amortization in 2023 from fully amortized assets. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on intangible assets.\nRestructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net\nRestructuring and asset related charges - net were $87 million, $146 million and $155 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge related to the 2023-2024 Restructuring Program in the amount of $89 million and $110 million, respectively\n. \nThe activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a pre-tax charge related to the 2022 Restructuring Program in the amount of $61 million of severance and related benefit costs and a $94 million ($65 million net of tax) impairment related to an equity method investment within the Electronics & Industrial segment. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Inventory write-offs associated with restructuring programs are recorded to \"Cost of Sales” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, there were no goodwill impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there was a goodwill impairment charge of $804 million related to the Water & Protection segment. \nAcquisition, Integration and Separation Costs\nAcquisition, integration and separation costs were $168 million, $20 million and $193 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Acquisition, integration and separation costs primarily consist of financial advisory, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting, other professional advisory fees and other contractual transaction payments. For the year ended December 31, 2024, these costs were primarily related to the Previously Intended Business Separations, including the Intended Electronics Separation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these costs were primarily related to Spectrum Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2022, these costs were primarily related to the Terminated Intended Rogers Corporation Acquisition, specifically the $162.5 million termination fee paid, the Biomaterials business unit divestiture and the Laird PM acquisition in 2021.\nEquity in Earnings of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company's share of the earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates was $60 million, $51 million and $75 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 compared to the prior years is primarily due to higher earnings in the underlying nonconsolidated affiliates. \n38\nTable of Contents\nSundry Income (Expense) - Net\nSundry income (expense) - net includes a variety of income and expenses such as foreign currency exchange gains or losses, interest income, dividends from investments, gains and losses on sales of investments, losses on debt extinguishments and assets, non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit plan credits or costs, interest rate swap mark-to-market adjustments, interest rate swap net interest settlement and certain litigation matters. Sundry income (expense) - net for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $76 million of expense compared with $102 million and $191 million of income in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe year ended December 31, 2024 included a $138 million net loss related to interest rate swap activity including mark-to-market adjustments and a $74 million loss on debt extinguishment partially offset by $73 million of interest income. The decrease in interest income period over period is due to the decreased cash balance in 2024. \nThe year ended December 31, 2023 included interest income of $155 million and a $19 million net gain on divestiture and sales of other assets, primarily related to a land sale within the Water & Protection segment, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses of $73 million.\nThe year ended December 31, 2022 included interest income of $50 million primarily due to higher cash on hand and marketable securities in the fourth quarter, income of $37 million related to the second quarter sale of a land use right within the Water & Protection segment, a $26 million gain on sale of the Biomaterials business unit recorded in the second quarter, income related to non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit plans of $28 million and foreign currency exchange gains of $15 million.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $366 million, $396 million, and $492 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily due to the absence of interest expense on the $300 million floating-rate long-term senior unsecured notes that matured in November 2023 and the partial redemption of $650 million aggregate principal amount of the 2038 notes during the second quarter 2024, partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest.\nThe decrease in interest expense from the 2023 compared to 2022, is primarily due to the redemption of $2.5 billion fixed-rate long-term senior unsecured notes due in November 2023, the decrease in commercial paper borrowing and the absence of the structuring and the commitment fees on term loans related to the Terminated Intended Rogers Corporation Acquisition, partially offset by the increase in interest expense from the interest rate swap.\nRefer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes on Continuing Operations\nThe Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned and the level of income relative to tax attributes. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 34.7 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,192 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, was principally driven by the geographic mix of earnings offset by the U.S. taxation of foreign operations as well as certain discrete tax expenses, including the settlement in the second quarter of an international tax audit for which the Company is partially indemnified. In addition, there was a $103 million tax expense recorded in connection with an internal restructuring.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's effective tax rate was (5.8) percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $504 million. The effective tax rate differential was principally the result of the non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $804 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 partially offset by a $324 million tax benefit recorded in connection with an internal restructuring.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's effective tax rate was 26.7 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,448 million. The effective tax rate differential was driven by the U.S tax effect of foreign earnings and dividends, geographic mix of earnings and the tax impacts of acquisition, integration, and separation costs. \nThe underlying factors affecting the Company’s overall tax rate are summarized in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n39\nTable of Contents\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe revenues and certain expenses of the M&M Businesses are classified as discontinued operations in the historical periods. Certain expenses, including separation costs, of the M&M Businesses are classified as discontinued operations in the current period. In addition, the Auto Adhesives & Fluids, Multibase\nTM\n and Tedlar® product lines within the historical Mobility & Materials segment (the \"Retained Businesses\") are not included in the scope of the M&M Divestitures and are included in Corporate & Other. \nThe costs of the M&M Businesses that are classified as discontinued operations include only direct operating expenses incurred prior to the November 1, 2022 M&M Divestiture and prior to the November 1, 2023 Delrin® Divestiture. Indirect costs, such as those related to corporate and shared service functions previously allocated to the M&M Businesses, do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations and remain reported within continuing operations. A portion of these indirect costs related to activities the Company continues to undertake post-closing of the M&M Divestitures, and for which it is reimbursed (“Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs”). In addition, a portion of these indirect costs relate to activities the Company performs post the close of the Delrin® Divestiture and for which it is reimbursed. Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs are reported within continuing operations but are excluded from operating EBITDA as defined below. The remaining portion of these indirect costs are not subject to future reimbursement (“Stranded Costs”). Stranded Costs are reported within continuing operations in Corporate & Other and are included within Operating EBITDA.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Spectrum Plastics Group (“Spectrum”) from AEA Investors (the “Spectrum Acquisition”). Spectrum is part of the Electronics & Industrial segment.\nEffective as of January 1, 2024, Electronics & Industrial realigned certain product lines that comprise its business units (Industrial Solutions, Interconnect Solutions and Semiconductor Technologies) that are intended to optimize business operations across the segment leading to enhanced value for customers and cost savings. The net trade revenue table, within Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, has been recast for all periods presented to reflect the new structure. The realignment did not result in changes to total Electronics & Industrial segment net sales.\nOn July 28, 2024, DuPont completed the acquisition of Donatelle Plastics, LLC (\"Donatelle Plastics\"), (the \"Donatelle Plastics Acquisition\"). Donatelle Plastics is being integrated into Industrial Solutions within the Electronics & Industrial segment.\nThe Company's measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBITDA as this is the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., “Income from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating pension / other post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) / charges, and foreign exchange gains / losses, excluding Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs, and adjusted for significant items.\n40\nTable of Contents\nELECTRONICS & INDUSTRIAL\nThe Electronics & Industrial segment is a leading provider of materials and solutions for the fabrication and packaging of semiconductors and integrated circuits and provides innovative solutions for thermal management and electromagnetic shielding as well as metallization processes for metal finishing, decorative, and industrial applications.

Net sales increased due to an 8 percent increase in volume and a 6 percent increase in portfolio actions partially offset by a 2 percent decline in local price and product mix and a 1 percent unfavorable currency impact. Volume growth in Semiconductor Technologies and Interconnect Solutions was partially offset by declines in Industrial Solutions. Within Semiconductor Technologies, volume gains were driven by semiconductor demand recovery, primarily due to AI technology applications, advanced node transitions and higher China demand, as well as higher volume in OLED materials led by new product launches. Broad based volume growth in Interconnect Solutions driven by end-market recovery, market share gains and demand from AI-driven technology ramps. Volume declines in Industrial Solutions were driven by channel inventory destocking, primarily for Kalrez® and within biopharma markets. The portfolio impact reflects the August 2023 acquisition of Spectrum and the July 2024 acquisition of Donatelle Plastics. The unfavorable currency impact is primarily driven by the Japanese yen.\nOperating EBITDA was $1,717 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, up 17 percent compared with $1,472 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to volume growth, the impact of higher production rates in Semiconductor Technologies and Interconnect Solutions, savings from restructuring actions and the earnings contribution from the Spectrum and Donatelle Plastics acquisitions partially offset by higher variable compensation and select growth investments.\n2023 Versus 2022\nElectronics & Industrial net sales were $5,337 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, down 10 percent from $5,917 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net sales decreased due to an 11 percent volume decline and a 1 percent currency headwind offset by a 2 percent increase in portfolio. Volume declines in Semiconductor Technologies were driven by inventory destocking and reduced semiconductor fabrication utilization rates due to electronics demand weakness, led by China, slightly offset by increased demand for OLED materials. Volume declines in Interconnect Solutions related to decreased spending on consumer and industrial electronics and related channel inventory destocking, both led by China. Within Industrial Solutions, volume declines were driven by channel inventory destocking within electronic parts and biopharma markets and lower demand in printing and packaging markets. Local price and product mix gains in Semiconductor Technologies and Industrial Solutions, as a result of actions taken to offset cost inflation, were offset by declines in Interconnect Solutions, including the impact of lower pass-through metals prices. The unfavorable currency impact is primarily driven by the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The portfolio impact primarily reflects the August 1, 2023 acquisition of Spectrum.\n41\nTable of Contents\nOperating EBITDA was $1,472 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, down 20 percent compared with $1,836 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreased sales volumes, the impact of reduced production rates to better align inventory with demand, slightly offset by the earnings associated with Spectrum.\nWATER & PROTECTION\nThe Water & Protection segment is a leading provider of engineered products and integrated systems for a number of industries including worker safety, water purification and separation, aerospace, energy, medical packaging and building materials.

Safety Solutions had volume declines mainly due to channel inventory destocking, primarily in medical packaging products within healthcare markets. Water Solutions volume declines were primarily due to distributor inventory destocking from weaker industrial demand in China. Shelter Solutions sales were relatively flat from mixed demand in construction markets. The unfavorable currency impact is primarily driven by the Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan, partially offset by the Euro.\nOperating EBITDA was $1,360 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, down 2 percent compared with $1,388 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 driven by decreased volumes and higher variable compensation, partially offset by productivity and savings from restructuring actions.\n2023 Versus 2022\nWater & Protection net sales were $5,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, down 5 percent from $5,957 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to a 7 percent decline in volume and a 1 percent unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by a 3 percent increase in local price and product mix. Volume declines within Safety Solutions were due to channel inventory destocking, primarily in medical packaging. Shelter Solutions volume declines were driven by weak demand in construction markets including channel inventory destocking. Water Solutions volume declines were primarily due to distributor destocking and weaker industrial demand in China. Local price and product mix increased across all businesses and in all regions as the result of broad-based actions taken in the prior year to offset cost inflation. The unfavorable currency impact is primarily driven by the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen. \nOperating EBITDA was $1,388 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, down 3 percent compared with $1,431 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 driven by decreased sales volumes, the impact of reduced production rates and unfavorable currency impacts partially offset by net pricing gains.

The Company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. Management expects the generation of cash from operations and the ability to access the debt capital markets and other sources of liquidity will continue to provide sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet the Company’s and its subsidiaries' obligations as they come due. However, DuPont is unable to predict the extent of macroeconomic related impacts which depend on uncertain and unpredictable future developments. In light of this uncertainty, the Company has taken steps to further ensure liquidity and capital resources, as discussed below.\nIn millions\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,850 \n$\n2,392 \nTotal debt\n$\n7,171 \n$\n7,800 \nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023 were held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Company held no investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2024 and \n2023\n. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due to cash used in the current year to fund the Q1 2024 ASR Transaction, the Donatelle Acquisition, partial redemption of 2038 Notes and general corporate purposes. Refer to subsequent paragraphs for further discussion of the drivers of the change in cash and cash equivalents.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2024 and \n2023\n was $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the partial redemption of $650 million of 2038 Notes discussed below.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company is contractually obligated to make future cash payments of $7.3 billion and $4.0 billion associated with principal and interest, respectively, on debt obligations. Related to the principal, $1.9 billion will be due in the next twelve months and the remainder will be due subsequent to 2025. The Company may address the maturity with cash on hand, issuance of commercial paper, utilizing existing credit facilities, accessing the debt capital markets or a combination of any of them. Related to interest, $359 million will be due in the next twelve months and the remainder will be due subsequent to 2025. The majority of interest obligations will be due in 2030 or later.\nIn relation to the Company’s fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, there is a mandatory early termination date of December 15, 2025.

The partial redemption occurred on June 15, 2024, at the redemption price set forth in the indenture of the 2038 Notes. The Company funded the repayment with cash on hand. As a result of the early redemption of the debt, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred a loss of approximately $74 million, which consisted of the redemption premium, write-off of the deferred debt issuance costs and the basis adjustment from fair value hedge accounting on the 2022 Swaps associated with this borrowing. See Note 21 for further detail on the 2022 Swaps.\nIn connection with the Previously Intended Business Separations and continuing in light of the Intended Electronics Separation, DuPont is considering potentially repaying, redeeming, repurchasing, or exchanging some or all of its other senior notes, which could include redemptions, tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other transactions or a combination of any of them, which will be on pricing terms that are determined at the time of any such transaction. Such transactions will depend on liquidity considerations, contractual and legal restrictions, prevailing market conditions and other factors.\n44\nTable of Contents\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nThe Company has entered a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility in the second quarter of each calendar year beginning in 2022.

The completion of the $2B ASR Transaction completes the $5B Share Buyback Program.\nIn the first quarter 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase and retirement of up to $1 billion of common stock (“the $1B Share Buyback Program”). Under the $1B Share Buyback Program, repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions off market, including additional ASR agreements in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The $1B Share Buyback Program terminates on June 30, 2025, unless extended or shortened by the Board of Directors. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on factors such as the share price, economic and market conditions, and corporate and regulatory requirements. At this time and with the continued focus on the Intended Electronic Separation, the Company does not currently plan to complete the remaining authorization under the $1B Share Buyback Program.\nAlso in the first quarter 2024, DuPont entered an ASR agreement with one counterparty for the repurchase of about $500 million of common stock (\"Q1 2024 ASR Transaction\"). DuPont paid an aggregate of $500 million to the counterparty and received initial deliveries of 6.0 million shares of DuPont common stock, which were retired immediately and recorded as a reduction of retained earnings of $400 million. The remaining $100 million was evaluated as an unsettled forward contract indexed to DuPont common stock, classified within stockholders' equity as of March 31, 2024.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Q1 2024 ASR Transaction was completed. The settlement resulted in the delivery of approximately 1.0 million additional shares of DuPont common stock, which were retired immediately and recorded as a reduction of retained earnings of $72 million. In total, the Company repurchased 6.9 million shares at an average price of $71.96 per share under the Q1 2024 ASR Transaction.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1 percent nondeductible excise tax imposed on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The net value is determined by the fair market value of the stock repurchased during the tax year, reduced by the fair market value of stock issued during the tax year. The Company recorded total excise tax of $8 million and $21 million, respectively, as a reduction to retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nSee Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. \nPension and Other Post-Employment Plans \nThe Company's funding policy is to contribute to defined benefit pension plans based on pension funding laws and local country requirements. Contributions exceeding funding requirements may be made at the Company's discretion. The Company expects to contribute approximately $56 million to its pension plans in 2025. The amount and timing of the Company’s actual future contributions will depend on applicable funding requirements, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors, separations and distributions. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Company’s pension plans.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company is contractually obligated to make future cash contributions of $562 million related to pension and other post-employment benefit plans. $56 million will be due in the next twelve months and the remainder will be due subsequent to 2025 with the majority due subsequent to 2029.\nRestructuring \nIn December 2023, the Company approved targeted restructuring actions to capture near-term cost reductions due to macroeconomic factors as well as to further simplify certain organizational structures following the Spectrum acquisition and Delrin® Divestiture (the \"2023-2024 Restructuring Program\"). For the years ended December 31, 2023 through December 31, 2024, DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge related to the 2023-2024 Restructuring Program in the amount of $199 million, recognized in \"Restructuring and asset related charges - net\" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of $114 million of severance and related benefit costs and asset related charges of $85 million. At December 31, 2024, total liabilities related to the 2023-2024 Restructuring Program were $47 million for severance and related benefit costs, \n48\nTable of Contents\nrecognized in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory write-offs for plant line closures in connection with the 2023-2024 Restructuring Program were $25 million in \"Cost of Sales\" within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nIn October 2022, the Company approved targeted restructuring actions to capture near-term cost reductions and to further simplify certain organizational structures following the M&M Divestitures (the \"2022 Restructuring Program\"). For the years ended December 31, 2023 through December 31, 2024, DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge related to the 2022 Restructuring Program in the amount of $94 million, recognized in \"Restructuring and asset related charges - net\" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of severance and related benefit costs. At December 31, 2024, total liabilities related to the 2022 Restructuring Program were $1 million for severance and related benefit costs, recognized in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Actions related to the 2022 Restructuring Program are substantially complete.\nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company's restructuring programs.\nOther Off-balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe MOU Cost Sharing Agreement\nIn connection with the cost sharing arrangement entered into as part of the MOU, the companies agreed to establish an escrow account to support and manage potential future eligible PFAS costs. Subject to the terms of the arrangement, contributions to the escrow account will be made annually by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva through 2028. Over such period, Chemours will deposit a total of $500 million into the account and DuPont and Corteva, together, will deposit an additional $500 million pursuant to the terms of their existing Letter Agreement. DuPont's aggregate escrow deposits of $35 million at December 31, 2024, are reflected in \"Restricted cash and cash equivalents - noncurrent\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs of June 30, 2023, DuPont had deposited an aggregate of $100 million into the MOU Escrow Account all of which it used to fund in part its $400 million contribution to the Water District Settlement Fund. The judgment became final in April 2024, therefore $400 million contribution, plus interest, to the Water District Settlement Fund is reflected as a cash outflow within cash flows from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company expects to make cash payments related to qualified PFAS spend of $30 million in the next twelve months. Additional information regarding the MOU and funding of the escrow account can be found in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Contractual Obligations\nPurchase obligations represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. As of December 31, 2024, the Company is contractually obligated to make future cash payments of $96 million related to purchase obligations, of which $48 million will be due in the next twelve months and the remainder will be due subsequent to 2025.\nLease obligations represents future finance and operating lease payments. As of December 31, 2024, obligations of future lease payments are $469 million, of which $97 million will be due in the next twelve months and remainder will be due subsequent to 2025.\nEnvironmental remediation obligations represents costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters and Non-PFAS clean-up responsibilities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company is contractually obligated to make future cash payments of $129 million, of which $18 million will be due in the next twelve months and remainder will be due subsequent to 2025. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \nOther miscellaneous obligations includes liabilities related to deferred compensation and other noncurrent liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company is contractually obligated to make future cash payments of $111 million related to other miscellaneous obligations, the majority of which is due subsequent to 2025.\n49\nTable of Contents\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \nThe Company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The Company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the Company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the Company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nPension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the Company's pension plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan-by-plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.\nFor the majority of the benefit plans, the Company utilizes the Aon AA corporate bond yield curves to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. \nThe Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. For plans, the long-term expected return on plan assets pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets.\nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the Company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the Company's pension plans based on assets and liabilities on a continuing operations basis at December 31, 2024:\nPre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)\n(Dollars in millions)\n1/4 Percentage\nPoint\nIncrease\n1/4 Percentage\nPoint\nDecrease\nDiscount rate\n$\n(1)\n$\n1 \nExpected rate of return on plan assets\n5 \n(5)\nAdditional information with respect to pension plans, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegal Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the Company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The Company records accruals for legal matters, including its obligations under the MOU as impacted by the Letter Agreement, when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific \n50\nTable of Contents\nclaims including unasserted claims, the Company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the Company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the Company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe breadth of the Company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the Company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the Company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the Company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and the possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities. The impact, if any, of these audits to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is not estimable. \nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the Company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $669 million, net of a valuation allowance of $772 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\"IRA\") was signed into law on August 16, 2022 and is effective to applicable corporations beginning in 2023. The IRA introduced a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”), based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations. Applicable corporations will be allowed to claim a credit for the minimum tax paid against regular tax in future years. The Company is an applicable corporation subject to the CAMT requirements however, the Company did not incur a CAMT liability for 2024 and 2023. The IRA also established an excise tax that imposes a 1 percent surcharge on stock repurchases, effective January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the 1 percent surcharge on stock repurchases.\nAssessments of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nAssessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the Company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the Company's diversified product lines operate, and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. \nCh\nanges in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the Company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the Company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses. \n51\nTable of Contents\nThe Company performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value is below carrying value, at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The Company has eight reporting units.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value\n. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit or asset specific operating results and cost factors, as well as industry, market and macroeconomic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the Company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that t\nhe carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required. \nIf additional quantitative testing is performed, an impairment loss is recognized when the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill at the reporting unit. The Company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a combination of the income approach and market approach.\nUnder the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The Company uses internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on its most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions, some of which are considered significant, including \nLevel 3 unobservable inputs\n: projected revenue growth, EBITDA margin, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital, terminal growth rate, and the tax rate. These key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the Company as a whole, underlying business fundamentals and industry risk. The Company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The Company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts.\nUnder the market approach, the Company applies the Guideline Public Company Method (\"GPCM\") utilizing \nLevel 3 unobservable inputs\n. Selected peer sets are based on close competitors, publicly traded companies and reviews of analysts' reports, public filings, and industry research. In selecting the EBITDA multiples and determining the fair value, the Company considers the size, growth, and profitability of each reporting unit versus the relevant guideline public companies. When applicable, third-party purchase offers may be utilized to measure fair value.\n \nEstimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.\nGoodwill Impairment Testing at October 1, 2024\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024 at October 1, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing by applying the qualitative assessment to seven of its reporting units and the quantitative assessment to one reporting unit. The Company considered various qualitative factors that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units, and the results of the qualitative assessments indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. For the reporting units tested under the quantitative assessment, the results indicated that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded its carrying values. The estimated fair value of the Protection reporting unit within Water & Protection exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 percent. Given this level of fair value, the reporting unit is sensitive to changes in the significant assumptions used in the analysis, including projected revenue growth, EBITDA margin, weighted average cost of capital, terminal growth rate and tax rate.\n52\nTable of Contents\nLONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nThe Company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The Company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the Company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans. The Company has a few medical, dental and life insurance benefits for employees, pensioners and survivors and for employees (other post-employment benefits or \"OPEB\" plans).\nPension coverage for employees of the Company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The Company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost-effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the Company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental and life insurance. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. \nPension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations of the sovereign country in which the pension plan operates. Unless required by law, the Company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax-deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs.\nThe Company contributed $5 million to its funded pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company contributed $9 million and $23 million to its funded pension plans for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All values within this Long-Term Employee Benefits section are inclusive of balances and activity associated with discontinued operations.\nThe Company does maintain one U.S. pension benefit plan. This plan is a separate unfunded plan and these benefits are paid to employees from operating cash flows. The Company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The Company made benefit payments of $46 million, $57 million, and $56 million to its unfunded plans, including OPEB plans, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn 2025, the Company expects to contribute approximately $56 million to its funded pension plans and its remaining plans with no plan assets. The amount and timing of actual future contributions will depend on applicable funding requirements, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors.\nThe Company's income can be affected by pension and defined contribution charges/(benefits) as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the Company's income for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits, which include defined contributions and net periodic benefit costs (credits):\nFor the Years Ended\nIn millions\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nLong-term employee benefit plan charges\n$\n123 \n$\n159 \n$\n138 \nThe above charges (benefit) for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. See \"Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits\" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.\nFor 2025, long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations is expected to increase by about $14 million compared to 2024. The increase is mainly due to higher expected net periodic benefit costs.\n53\nTable of Contents\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Company operates global manufacturing, facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the Company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. \nIn addition, the Company implements various voluntary programs to reduce its environmental footprint, which include initiatives to reduce air emissions, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water used and discharged, increase the efficiency of energy use, and seek to avoid, eliminate or minimize substances of concerns. \nThe Company incurs, and expects to incur for the foreseeable future, costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, such as DuPont’s sustainability strategy. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.\nPublic policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the Company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. However, the current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments.\nIn addition, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets.\nEnvironmental Operating Costs \nAs a result of its operations, the Company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The Company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.\nEnvironmental Remediation \nThe Company has incurred environmental remediation costs, including indemnification remediation costs, of $21 million, $69 million and $12 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:\n(In millions)\n \nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n90 \nRemediation payments \n1\n(5)\nNet increase in remediation accrual\n 1\n10 \nNet change, indemnification\n 2\n53 \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n148 \nRemediation payments \n1\n(7)\nNet increase in remediation accrual\n 1\n6 \nNet change, indemnification\n 2\n(18)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n129 \n1.\nExcludes indemnification remediation obligations and payments.\n2.\nRepresents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity pursuant to the DWDP Separation and Distribution Agreement and Letter Agreement as discussed below and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This is not inclusive of the environmental accrual related to eligible PFAS costs associated with the MOU of $146 million and $152 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n54\nTable of Contents\nConsiderable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $285 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2024. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company. \nPursuant to the DWDP Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Letter Agreement discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company indemnifies Dow and Corteva for certain environmental matters. The Company has recorded an indemnification liability of $84 million corresponding to the Company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2024. The indemnification liability is included in the total remediation accrual liability of $129 million. \nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures \nCapital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the Company’s internal environmental goals, were $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This amount includes $2 million of expenditures used towards the Company's climate change initiatives. The Company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $12 million in 2025, with less than $3 million estimated for climate change initiatives.\n55\nTable of Contents",
