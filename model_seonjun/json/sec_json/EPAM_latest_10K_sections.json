Our focus on delivering quality service is reflected in established relationships with many of our clients, with 65.4% and 34.6% of our revenues in 2024 coming from clients that had used our services for at least five and ten years, respectively. We aim to grow our client portfolios organically and through strategic acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisition targets that can expand our vertical-specific domain expertise, geographic footprint, service portfolio, client base and management expertise. \nThe following table shows revenues from the top five and ten clients in the respective year as a percentage of revenues for that year: \n \n% of Revenues for Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTop five clients\n15.8 \n%\n16.6 \n%\n16.4 \n%\nTop ten clients\n23.4 \n%\n23.6 \n%\n23.8 \n%\nAs we remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more clients to our client mix, we expect revenue concentration from our top clients to decrease over the long-term. \n 4\nTable of Contents\nSee “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to revenues. \nSee Note 19 “Segment Information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our reportable segments.\nGlobal Delivery Model\nOur global delivery model and centralized support functions, combined with the benefits of scale from the shared use of fixed-cost resources, have created a delivery base whereby our applications, tools, methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions from our global delivery centers to our clients across the world. Over the years we have developed a robust global delivery model that serves as a key competitive advantage, enabling us to better meet our clients’ diverse needs and to provide a compelling value proposition.\n We continuously evolve our delivery platform to support our business needs and strategy by engaging personnel with diversified skills in existing and new locations. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 55,100 delivery personnel consisting mainly of our core information technology professionals as well as consultants, designers, architects, engineers and trainers. \n We serve our clients through on-site, off-site and offshore locations across the world and use strategically located delivery centers to offer a strong, diversified and cost-effective delivery platform. In the normal course of business, we may relocate or assist in relocating our employees as business needs arise, new office geographies are added or client engagements require teams to be available in particular locations. \n During 2024, India became our largest delivery location, measured by the number of delivery professionals, and as of December 31, 2024, we had 10,072 delivery professionals in this location. We focused on growing India as a key delivery location and added 3,006 delivery professionals since December 31, 2023. \nUkraine continues to be a significant delivery location for us and we had 8,764 delivery professionals there as of December 31, 2024, compared with 9,113 delivery professionals as of December 31, 2023. Since the Russian forces' attack on Ukraine and its people began on February 24, 2022, our operations in Ukraine have not been significantly impacted, and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our highest priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in Ukraine as well as in the broader region, and we have continued to support relocating our employees to lower risk locations, both inside Ukraine and to other countries where we operate. The vast majority of our Ukraine employees are in safe locations and we continuously monitor the situation.\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, we shifted the way we operate in our delivery locations by discontinuing our operations in Russia and continuing to execute our business continuity plans and sustaining our hiring efforts across multiple locations in India, Central and Western Asia, Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to hiring efforts, the acquisitions of businesses that we complete further diversify our employee base and delivery locations. Our other large delivery locations are Poland, Mexico and Belarus with approximately 5,000, 3,525, and 3,350 delivery professionals, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Our global delivery centers throughout the world, including in Ukraine, have sufficient resources, including infrastructure and capital, to support ongoing operations. \nHuman Capital \nOur employees are a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and serve our clients. We believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our clients and investors. Therefore, it is critical to our success that we are able to identify, attract, hire and retain delivery professionals who are highly skilled in information technology to execute our services, as well as individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other key management positions. To attract, retain and motivate our employees, we offer a dynamic work environment, a culture that values the individual, ongoing skills development initiatives, attractive career advancement with continuous rotation and promotion opportunities while providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately 61,200, 53,150, and 59,300 employees, respectively, of which approximately 55,100, 47,350, and 52,850 were delivery professionals, respectively. \n 5\nTable of Contents\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness:\n We invest in programs designed to improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of our employees so we can offer a safe, welcoming, and productive workplace that supports and enhances the work-life balance and wellness of our employees. Our health and safety programs are designed to comply with the regulations in the multiple cities and countries where we operate but also provide working conditions that are compatible with the necessities of our delivery and administrative operations, whether our employees choose to work remotely or in EPAM’s or our clients’ offices.\nRecruitment, Training and Utilization:\n As an innovation-driven business in a competitive industry, our success depends on hiring the most talented employees, training and developing that talent, and deploying them to satisfy client demand. We are particularly focused on identifying and cultivating the next generation of exceptional leaders, emphasizing technical expertise, while enhancing succession pipelines and improving diversity in our key positions.\nWe have dedicated full-time employees who oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including talent acquisition teams to locate and attract qualified and experienced professionals around the world. Our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and, therefore, we are continuously exploring new geographies, markets, and sources to locate talented personnel and present them with competitive compensation programs and educational opportunities. \nWe actively monitor how we\n \nutilize our delivery professionals and specialists to balance the needs of our clients with the availability, location, and skill sets of our employees and their need for diverse and challenging work. We manage utilization through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects for our clients. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the utilization rates of our delivery professionals were approximately 76.7%, 74.3%, and 75.8%, respectively. \nEPAM invests significant resources in training and developing our employees through our learning and development programs. Our largest learning and development investment has been directed towards developing our engineering talent, including targeted training programs, innovation labs, and significant internal production projects. Our employees consumed 2.4 million learning hours in 2024. We deliver training and development opportunities and content through our unique learning ecosystem that promotes learning in the daily workflow to improve retention and productivity, and through dedicated learning events. \nWe deliver learning and development content through proprietary platforms that are available to all of our employees. Our digital learning platform provides our employees with a recommendation engine that suggests courses and materials based on employee role, level, location and skills. Our electronic library platform makes books and publications available to all of our employees and we celebrate learning achievements through our recognition portal, where we promote our employees’ learning accomplishments and employees can recognize each other for their teamwork, initiative, and unique, valuable skills.\nCulture:\n EPAM provides our clients with the skills of our talented personnel, which includes people with varied backgrounds and characteristics, to drive innovation and varied approaches to delivering our services. We believe that innovation comes from the unique perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our global employees, so we strive to create a culture to support that uniqueness by creating employee groups that recognize and share the varied perspectives of our personnel so employees of all backgrounds, interests, and identities can grow and thrive professionally. \nIncreasing the breadth of viewpoints and experiences in executive and key operational leadership roles is an organizational priority that starts at the top of our organization. Women currently represent approximately 44% of the independent directors on our Board and we have developed programs to identify, retain, mentor, and supply a pipeline of qualified candidates from all backgrounds at every level of our Company. Our programs include dedicating resources and personnel in our talent acquisition team to identify, recognize, and hire from underrepresented groups in engineering, IT, and business. \nRecognizing that giving all people access to jobs in the software and technology industries starts with access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (“STEM”) education, EPAM created the EPAM E-Kids program where our employees volunteer their time to teach elementary school age children STEM concepts and introductory software coding skills. As of the end of 2024, we offered the EPAM E-Kids program in 25 countries. \nEmployee Engagement and Retention:\n As a participant in the United Nations Global Compact, we are committed to respecting our employees' fundamental human rights at work. We believe that retaining skilled talent requires substantially more than meeting basic employment and labor rights, and that employees who are fairly compensated, feel supported in their career development, and are engaged with their employer are more likely to remain with that employer. That is why we strive to provide pay and benefits that demonstrate the value of our employees to us, including a competitive salary, flexible work-life balance, paid time off, health coverage, ongoing training programs, relocation options, and recognition opportunities for open-source software contributions. \n 6\nTable of Contents\nOur career development programs create detailed and progressive training plans for our employees and help them choose from internal and external training options, mentoring programs, and hands-on opportunities to experience emerging technology areas. We designed our career development programs to enable our employees to develop their engineering skills, influence our culture, develop thought leadership, and introduce them to leaders in our industry. Our career development programs also give our employees opportunities to earn accreditation and relevant expertise in various technology fields, including software and project management certifications and recognition and credentialing from the industry’s primary software and cloud services providers.\nWe focus on retaining and engaging top talent by hiring people with the skill sets our clients need and who also share our values so we can build long-term employee satisfaction, which is supported by our voluntary attrition rate of 8.9%, 8.6%, and 13.8% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We endeavor to recruit for careers, not for short-term projects, and actively foster feedback from our employees so we can improve the EPAM employee experience. Receiving and learning from employee feedback plays a critical role in engaging and retaining our employees because it offers us insights on how we can improve our operations and enhance the skills of our employees. Our employees have demonstrated their satisfaction with our approach by giving their highest percentage of positive responses in our 2024 employee survey when asked if they can easily get support from their colleagues (93%), if they get management support (92%), if they feel that EPAM provides a supportive environment for all employees, regardless of gender, race, background, religion, or other personal traits (89%), and if they feel comfortable being themselves while working for EPAM (89%). Our focus on our employees’ experience is recognized inside and outside of EPAM. In 2023, the employee experience we create was recognized with awards from a number of different organizations in North America, Europe, and Asia, and we were also named on Newsweek’s list of Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces for the fourth consecutive year and recognized by Glassdoor as a Best Workplace for three consecutive years. \nSales and Marketing\nWe market and sell our services through our senior management, sales and business development teams, account managers, and professional staff. Our client service professionals and account managers, who maintain direct client relationships, play an integral role in engaging with current clients to identify and pursue potential business opportunities. This strategy has been effective in promoting repeat business and growth from within our existing client base and we believe that our reputation as a reliable provider of software engineering solutions drives additional business from inbound requests and referrals. In addition to effective client management, our sales model also utilizes an integrated sales and marketing approach that leverages a dedicated sales team to identify and acquire new accounts. \nWe maintain a marketing team, which coordinates corporate-level branding efforts such as participation in and the hosting of industry conferences and events as well as sponsorship of programming competitions. We have been recognized by many top global independent research agencies, such as Forrester, Gartner, IDC and Everest and by publications such as Newsweek, Forbes and Fortune. We are proud to be among the top 15 companies in Information Technology Services in the Fortune 1000 and to be recognized as a leader in the IDC MarketScapes for Worldwide Experience Build Services, Worldwide Experience Design Services and Worldwide Software Engineering Services. \nCompetition\nThe markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from multiple market participants such as other global technology solutions providers, specialized consulting firms, boutique digital companies and outsourcing companies based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as Eastern Europe, India, Latin America and China. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, end-to-end solution offerings, a reputation for and a track record of high-quality and on-time delivery of work, effective employee recruiting, training and retention, responsiveness to clients’ business needs, ability to scale, financial stability and price.\nWe face competition from various technology services providers such as Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, Endava, Genpact, GlobalLogic, Globant, Grid Dynamics, HCL Technologies, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro, among others. Additionally, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.\nWe believe that our focus on complex and innovative software product development solutions, our technical employee base, and our development and continuous improvement in process methodologies, applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future. \n 7\nTable of Contents\nQuality Management and Information Security \nWe are continuously investing in systems, applications, tools and infrastructure to manage all aspects of our global delivery process in order to manage quality and information security risks, while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our clients. We have developed sophisticated project management techniques and procedures facilitated through our proprietary project management tools, a web-based collaborative environment for software development, which we consider critical for visibility into project deliverables, resource management, team messaging and project-related documents. These tools promote collaboration and effective oversight, reduce work time and costs, and increase quality for our IT management and our clients.\nWe maintain, monitor, and improve processes and infrastructure to protect our, our clients’ and their customers’ confidential and sensitive information and allocate internal and external resources to assess and ensure information security, cybersecurity and data privacy. We have made significant investments in the appropriate people, processes and technology to establish and manage information security, confidentiality requirements, and laws and regulations governing our activities, such as the European Union data protection legal framework referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act, and others.\nWe maintain a focus on adhering to stringent security, privacy and quality standards as well as internal controls which are compliant with ISO 27001, ISO 27701 and ISO 9001 standards. For certain services, EPAM obtains SOC1, SOC2, and/or SOC3 reports and shares them with our clients. These audits are performed by an independent auditor utilizing globally recognized attestation standards (ISAE 3402 and ISAE 3000). Our SOC reports, along with other certifications we hold, provide our clients with independent third-party assurance and validation of our information security, privacy management, quality management and general controls practices.\nCorporate and Social Responsibility and Environmental, Social, and Governance Initiatives\nWe are committed to integrating positive social, environmental and ethical practices into our business operations, corporate governance, and strategy. This commitment is key to our continual development as a business and drives value for our employees, clients, business partners, the community and other stakeholders. We practice the principles established in our Code of Ethical Conduct by making positive contributions to the communities in which we operate and championing corporate social responsibility efforts. \nThrough our focused efforts in the areas of Education, Environment, and Community, we are committed to sharing the expertise and attributes of our highly skilled global workforce to effectively support the needs of and positively add to the world at large and the communities where we work and live. By understanding our impact on local, regional and global communities, we strive to create positive change and opportunities in areas where it is needed most. \nWe believe responsible stewardship of the environment is critical, and we take this responsibility seriously. We continually strive to improve our environmental performance through implementation of sustainable development and environmental practices including recycling and upcycling electronics and computers, designing and releasing a carbon footprint calculator to our employees and the general public, and building new offices according to the conservation standards of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system. EPAM was a Frost & Sullivan Enlightened Sustainable Growth Leader for the past three consecutive years.\nIntellectual Property\nProtecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our knowledge, create solutions for our clients, and continuously advance our information security. We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, cybersecurity, and confidentiality obligations to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all deliverable intellectual property and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or provision of services and to keep any disclosed information confidential.\nWe also enter into confidentiality agreements with our clients and suppliers to protect information and maintain information security. Our agreements with our clients cover our use of their software systems and platforms as our clients usually own the intellectual property in the software, products, and solutions we develop for them. Furthermore, we often grant our clients a nonexclusive license to use relevant technologies in our pre-existing intellectual property portfolio, but only to the extent necessary to use the software or systems we develop for them. Our suppliers are generally bound by our supplier code of conduct, which imposes an obligation to protect our and our clients’ intangible assets, including confidential information, personal information, and intellectual property, and to protect the security of those assets.\n 8\nTable of Contents\nRegulations\nDue to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services, our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations. Several foreign and U.S. federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulation and Legislation and Risks Related to Information Security and Data Protection.” We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including export restrictions, economic sanctions, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and data privacy regulations.

We address our clients’ transformation challenges by fusing EPAM Continuum’s integrated strategy, experience and technology consulting with our 30+ years of engineering execution to speed our clients’ time to market and drive greater value from their digital investments.\nThrough increased specialization in focused verticals and a continued emphasis on strategic partnerships, we are able to deliver technology transformation from start to finish, leveraging agile methodologies, proven client collaboration frameworks, engineering excellence tools, hybrid teams and our award-winning proprietary global delivery platform.\n 28\nTable of Contents\nOur clients depend on us to solve their complex technical challenges and rely on our expertise in core engineering, advanced technologies, digital design and intelligent enterprise development. We combine our software engineering heritage with strategic business and innovation consulting, design thinking, and physical-digital capabilities to deliver end-to-end digital transformation services for our clients. We focus on building long-term partnerships with our clients in a market that is constantly challenged by the pressures of digitization through our innovative strategy and scalable software solutions, integrated advisory, business consulting and experience design, and a continually evolving mix of advanced capabilities.\nOur global delivery model and centralized support functions, combined with the benefits of scale from the shared use of fixed-cost resources, enhance our productivity levels and enable us to better manage the efficiency of our global operations. As a result, we have created a delivery base whereby our applications, tools, methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions from our global delivery centers to our clients across the world. Our teams of consultants, designers, architects, engineers and trainers have the capabilities and skill sets to deliver business results.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we have completed several acquisitions of businesses, including NEORIS and First Derivative. We believe these acquisitions will enhance our client portfolio and service offerings as well as expand our presence in Latin America and Europe. \nSee Note 3 “Acquisitions” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to our completed acquisitions of businesses. \nBusiness Update Regarding the War in Ukraine \nOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces attacked Ukraine and its people and EPAM has repeatedly called for an immediate end to this unlawful and unconscionable attack. EPAM’s highest priority is the safety and security of its employees and their families in Ukraine as well as in the broader region, and we have continued to support relocating our employees to lower risk locations, both within Ukraine and to other countries where we operate. The vast majority of our Ukraine employees are in safe locations and operating at levels of productivity consistent with those achieved prior to the attack. As of December 31, 2024, Ukraine continues to be a significant delivery location with a large number of delivery professionals. Furthermore, we have maintained our $100 million humanitarian aid commitment to our people in Ukraine in addition to our other donations and volunteer efforts. \nThe impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on our operations, personnel, and physical assets in Ukraine has had, and, along with any escalation of the war that includes Belarus’ territory or military, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations. Actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Belarus, and Belarus’ responses to those sanctions, including counter-sanctions and other actions, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations. Clients have and may continue to seek altered terms, conditions, and delivery locations for the performance of services, delay planned work or seek services from alternate providers, or suspend, terminate, fail to renew, or reduce existing contracts or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Some of our clients have implemented steps to block internet communications with Ukraine and Belarus to protect against potential cyberattacks or other information security threats, which has caused a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver our services to these clients from those locations. Such material adverse effects disrupt our delivery of services, cause us to shift all or portions of our work occurring in the region to other countries, restrict our ability to engage in certain projects in the region and serve certain clients in or from the region, and could negatively impact our personnel, operations, financial results and business outlook. Our Board of Directors continues its oversight of our strategic, geopolitical, and cybersecurity risks and the risks related to our geographic expansion. Our Board has received updates from management during both regular and special meetings, while also providing oversight of the risks associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other strategic areas of importance related to the war.\nMoving Forward\nWe continue to monitor and respond to the difficult conditions in Ukraine while maintaining a focus on our clients and long-term growth. We execute on our business continuity plans and adapt to developments as they occur to protect the safety of our people and address impacts on our delivery infrastructure, including reallocating work to other geographies within our global footprint. We engage with both our personnel and our clients when navigating delivery challenges and we continue to operate productively in a multitude of locations and provide consistent high-quality delivery to our clients. Our global delivery centers have sufficient resources, including infrastructure and capital, to support ongoing operations while maintaining the safety and security of our employees and their families in Ukraine as well as in the broader region. \n 29\nTable of Contents\nThe implementation and execution of our business continuity plans, relocation costs, our humanitarian commitment to our people in Ukraine, and the cost of our phased exit from Russia resulted in materially increased expenses. Some of these expenses continued during this year and we expect some of these expenses will continue to occur in subsequent quarters for some time in the future.\nWe have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the war in Ukraine because the conflict and government reactions change quickly and are beyond our control. Prolonged military activities, broad-based sanctions and counter-sanctions, or escalation of the war that includes Belarus’ territory or military could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. The information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our control or present awareness. \nFor additional information on the various risks posed by the attack against Ukraine and the impact in the region as well as other disruptors to our business, please read “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. When reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.\nAn accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. You should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report. Additional information on our policies is in Note 1 “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues\n — We recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a client in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract. Consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Variable consideration usually takes the form of volume-based discounts, service level credits, price concessions or incentives. Determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported. \nWe derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements, which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to clients by combining software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services. Fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements. We generate the majority of our revenues under time-and-material contracts, which are billed using hourly, daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the client. We apply a practical expedient and revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed.\n 30\nTable of Contents\nFixed-price contracts include maintenance and support arrangements, which may exceed one year in duration. Maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period. Fixed-price contracts also include application development arrangements, where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered. Assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues, receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period. \n Revenues from licenses which have significant stand-alone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the client. Revenues from licenses which do not have stand-alone functionality are recognized over time. If there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a client and when the client pays for that service is one year or less.\nWe report gross reimbursable “out-of-pocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\nBusiness Combinations\n — We account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A substantial portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, which typically include customer relationships, software, trade names, non-competition agreements, and assembled workforce. The allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. The significant estimates and assumptions used include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, customer attrition rates, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, and the useful lives for finite-lived assets. There are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. These determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. \nWe determine the fair value of contingent consideration using either Monte Carlo simulations (which involve a simulation of future revenues and earnings during the earn-out period using management's best estimates) or probability-weighted expected return methods. Changes in financial projections, market risk assumptions, discount rates or probability assumptions related to achieving the various earn-out criteria would result in a change in the fair value of contingent consideration. Such changes, if any, are recorded within Interest and other income, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\nIf the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Once the measurement period ends, which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions to the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\n 31\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, our total revenues increased 0.8% from the previous year to $4.728 billion. Revenues have been positively impacted by stabilizing demand for our services and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our revenue growth by 0.1% during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the previous year, partially offset by the sale of our remaining holdings in Russia in the third quarter of 2023. Revenues have also been positively impacted by our acquisitions of NEORIS and First Derivative, which in aggregate contributed $65.9 million to our revenues in 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we experienced a decrease in client concentration in our top client groups as a percentage of total revenues as compared to the previous year.\nSee Note 3 “Acquisitions” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to our completed acquisitions of businesses. \nWe discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical, client location, service arrangement type, and client concentration.\nRevenues by Vertical \nWe assign our clients into one of our five main vertical markets or a group of various industries where we are increasing our presence, which we label as “Emerging Verticals.” Emerging Verticals include clients in multiple industries such as energy, utilities, manufacturing, industrial materials, automotive, telecommunications and several others.\nThe following table presents our revenues by vertical and revenues as a percentage of total revenues by vertical for the periods indicated:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nFinancial Services\n$\n1,022,617 \n21.6 \n%\n$\n1,018,433 \n21.7 \n%\n$\n1,026,686 \n21.3 \n%\nConsumer Goods, Retail & Travel\n1,013,138 \n21.4 \n1,072,950 \n22.9 \n1,092,224 \n22.7 \nSoftware & Hi-Tech\n702,367 \n14.9 \n707,720 \n15.1 \n793,261 \n16.4 \nBusiness Information & Media\n674,597 \n14.3 \n753,981 \n16.1 \n809,952 \n16.8 \nLife Sciences & Healthcare\n574,605 \n12.2 \n489,914 \n10.4 \n507,367 \n10.5 \nEmerging Verticals\n740,616 \n15.6 \n647,542 \n13.8 \n595,208 \n12.3 \nRevenues\n$\n4,727,940\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n4,690,540\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n4,824,698\n \n100.0\n \n%\nFinancial Services became our largest vertical during 2024, comprising 21.6% of total revenues. Financial Services, Life Sciences & Healthcare, and Emerging Verticals experienced revenue growth in 2024 over the prior year, while Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel, Business Information & Media, and Software & Hi-Tech verticals experienced revenue declines in 2024 from the prior year.\n Revenues by Client Location \nOur revenues are sourced from multiple countries, which we assign into four geographic markets identified as Americas, EMEA, APAC, and CEE. As a result of the Company’s exit from Russia and sale of the Company’s remaining holdings in Russia to a third-party on July 26, 2023, revenues from the CEE region became no longer material. Starting in 2024, revenues from the CEE region are included in the EMEA region. We present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve, irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed. Revenues by client location differ from revenues by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Segments are not based on the geographic location of the clients, but rather they are based on the location of the Company’s management responsible for a particular client. \n 33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAmericas \n(1)\n$\n2,834,704 \n60.0 \n%\n$\n2,742,662 \n58.4 \n%\n$\n2,887,204 \n59.9 \n%\nEMEA \n(2)\n1,793,198 \n37.9 \n1,822,782 \n38.9 \n1,737,919 \n36.0 \nAPAC \n(3)\n100,038 \n2.1 \n102,138 \n2.2 \n120,370 \n2.5 \nCEE \n(4)\n— \n— \n22,958 \n0.5 \n79,205 \n1.6 \nRevenues\n$\n4,727,940\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n4,690,540\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n4,824,698\n \n100.0\n \n%\n(1)\nAmericas includes revenues from clients in North, Central and South America.\n(2)\nEMEA includes revenues from clients in Western Europe and the Middle East.\n(3)\nAPAC, or Asia Pacific, includes revenues from clients in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Australia.\n(4)\nCEE includes revenues from clients in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. As a result of the sale of the Company’s remaining holdings in Russia to a third-party on July 26, 2023, revenues from the CEE region are no longer material. Beginning in 2024, revenues from the CEE region are included in the EMEA region.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues in the Americas, our largest geography, were $2.835 billion, growing $92.0 million, or 3.4%, from $2.743 billion reported for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenues in this geography benefited from acquisitions which contributed $95.9 million to revenue growth in 2024. Revenues from Americas accounted for 60.0% of total revenues in 2024, an increase from 58.4% in the prior year. The United States continued to be our largest client location contributing revenues of $2.680 billion in 2024 compared to $2.634 billion in 2023. \nRevenues in our EMEA geography were $1.793 billion, a decrease of $29.6 million, or 1.6%, from $1.823 billion in the previous year. Revenues in this geography benefited from acquisitions which contributed $28.3 million to revenue growth in 2024. Revenues from EMEA accounted for 37.9% of consolidated revenues in 2024 as compared to 38.9% in the previous year. The top three revenue contributing client location countries in EMEA were the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany generating revenues of $523.4 million, $407.8 million and $206.1 million in 2024, respectively, compared to $585.2 million, $367.1 million and $178.5 million in 2023, respectively. \nRevenues from clients in locations in our APAC region comprised 2.1% of total revenues in 2024, a decrease from 2.2% in the prior year.\nDiscussion of revenues from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRevenues by Client Concentration \nWe have long-standing relationships with many of our clients and we seek to grow revenues from our existing clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements. Revenues derived from these clients may fluctuate as these accounts mature, upon beginning or completion of multi-year projects or due to external economic environment trends. We believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing clients. In addition, we remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more clients to our client mix through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, and over the long-term, we expect revenue concentration from our top clients to decrease. \nThe following table presents revenues contributed by our clients by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nTop five clients\n$\n748,324 \n15.8 \n%\n$\n780,606 \n16.6 \n%\n$\n793,603 \n16.4 \n%\nTop ten clients\n$\n1,107,647 \n23.4 \n%\n$\n1,109,033 \n23.6 \n%\n$\n1,149,966 \n23.8 \n%\nTop twenty clients\n$\n1,615,267 \n34.2 \n%\n$\n1,660,174 \n35.4 \n%\n$\n1,698,916 \n35.2 \n%\nClients below top twenty\n$\n3,112,673 \n65.8 \n%\n$\n3,030,366 \n64.6 \n%\n$\n3,125,782 \n64.8 \n%\n 34\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the number of clients grouped by revenues recognized by the Company for each year presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOver $20 Million \n43\n44\n49\n$10 - $20 Million\n59\n56\n51\n$5 - $10 Million\n83\n76\n85\n$1 - $5 Million\n331\n305\n303\n$0.5 - $1 Million\n168\n175\n185\nRevenues by Service Offering \nOur service arrangements have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our clients where we combine software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services in areas such as cloud platforms, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. We are continually expanding our service capabilities, moving beyond traditional services into business consulting, design and physical product development.\nThe following table shows revenues by service offering as an amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the years indicated:\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nProfessional services\n$\n4,698,183 \n99.4 \n%\n$\n4,661,733 \n99.4 \n%\n$\n4,800,047 \n99.5 \n%\nLicensing and other revenues\n29,757 \n0.6 \n%\n28,807 \n0.6 \n%\n24,651 \n0.5 \n%\nRevenues\n$\n4,727,940\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n4,690,540\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n4,824,698\n \n100.0\n \n%\nSee Note 13 “Revenues” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our contract types and related revenue recognition policies. \nCost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)\nThe principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, project-related travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to client projects. Salaries and other compensation expenses of our delivery professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing services for clients during a given period. Our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs. Additionally, government incentives and assistance related to services performed by delivery professionals and contractors assigned to client projects are reported in cost of revenues.\nWe manage the utilization levels of our delivery professionals through strategic hiring practices, dynamic management of staff, and efficient staffing of projects. Our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $3.277 billion, representing an increase of 0.6% from $3.257 billion reported last year. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs, including a $12.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, as well as $19.4 million in reduced benefits from our hedging program and a 0.2% unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Compensation costs also increased due to impacts from salary increases and promotions for existing professionals, an increase in variable compensation expense, the relocation of employees to higher cost geographies as well as a 2.2% growth in the average number of production professionals contributed in part by our acquisition of businesses during 2024. The increases were significantly offset by benefits totaling $68.8 million recognized in the second half of 2024 for government incentives related to conducting R&D activities in Poland and a decline in costs associated with our humanitarian efforts for Ukraine of $8.9 million and our unbilled business continuity resources of $9.4 million year-over-year. \n 35\nTable of Contents\nExpressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 69.3% and 69.4% during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to benefits totaling $68.8 million recognized in the second half of 2024 for government incentives related to conducting R&D activities in Poland and improved utilization, largely offset by a $12.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, increases in compensation costs including variable compensation, reduced benefits from our hedging program and the negative impact from the appreciation of foreign currencies in certain of our delivery locations.\nDiscussion of cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses represent expenditures associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business. These expenses include the costs of salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, severance, bad debt, travel, legal and accounting services, insurance, facilities including operating leases, advertising, and other promotional activities. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses contain costs of relocating our employees and various one-time and unusual expenses such as impairment charges.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses were $816.3 million, representing an increase of 0.2% as compared to $815.1 million reported last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by a $14.1 million increase in personnel-related costs, including a $7.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $10.3 million increase in professional fee expenses related to our business acquisition efforts and a $4.7 million increase in expenses associated with our humanitarian efforts for Ukraine. Personnel-related costs increased due to impacts from salary increases and promotions for existing professionals, increases in variable compensation expense and severance, which reflects the impact from the Cost Optimization Programs initiated in the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. See Note 12 “Cost Optimization Programs” for more information regarding the Company’s restructuring programs. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by an $8.4 million decrease in bad debt expense, a $5.6 million reduction in facility exit costs and a $3.9 million reduction in facilities and infrastructure expenses as compared to the prior year. \nExpressed as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.1% to 17.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year primarily driven by reductions in facility exit costs, bad debt expense and facilities and infrastructure expenses as a percentage of revenues. \nDiscussion of selling, general and administrative expenses from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of physical assets used in the operation of our business such as computer equipment, software, buildings we purchased, leasehold improvements as well as various office furniture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization expense also includes amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense was $89.6 million, representing a decrease of $2.2 million from $91.8 million reported in the prior year. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily the result of lower depreciation on furniture, fixtures, other equipment and computer hardware, partially offset by increased amortization of software licenses and acquired finite-lived intangible assets. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense remained the same at 1.9% during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023. \nDiscussion of depreciation and amortization expense from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLoss on Sale of Business\nOn July 26, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its remaining holdings in Russia to a third-party. The Company recorded a loss on sale of $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, including the recognition of the accumulated currency translation loss related to this foreign entity that was previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n 36\nTable of Contents\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net includes interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, gains and losses from certain financial instruments, interest expense related to our borrowings, certain government grant income, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. Interest and other income, net decreased from $51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 to $46.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. This decrease was largely driven by a $4.2 million decrease in government grant income and a $2.9 million increase in loss due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in other income.\nDiscussion of Interest and other income, net from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment. We consider factors that may contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future. These factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items.\nAs a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had $391.4 million, $325.7 million and $428.7 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pre-tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate. \nOur provision for income taxes includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest and penalty expense. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. We adjust these reserves after consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes was $129.9 million in 2024 and $119.5 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate decreased slightly from 22.3% in 2023 to 22.2% in 2024 primarily due to the increase in excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stock-based awards, which were $22.4 million in 2024 compared to $19.8 million in 2023. \nSee Note 16 “Income Taxes” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information and detail regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. \nDiscussion of the provision for income taxes from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nForeign Exchange Loss\nFor discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign Exchange Risk.”\nResults by Business Segment\nOur operations have historically consisted of three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Russia. On July 26, 2023, we completed the sale of our remaining holdings in Russia to a third party and as a result of this sale, we no longer have operations associated with the Russia segment.\n \n 37\nTable of Contents\nThe segments represent components of EPAM for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), to evaluate performance, allocate resources and make business decisions. We manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for our client base and market. As managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. In some cases, managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of EPAM’s senior management team. In such cases, the client’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment.\nSegment results are based on the segment’s revenues and operating profit, where segment operating profit is defined as segment income from operations before unallocated costs. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. Intersegment transactions are excluded from the segment’s revenues and operating profit on the basis that they are neither included in the measure of a segment’s profit and loss results, nor considered by the CODM during the review of segment results. Certain corporate expenses are not allocated to specific segments as these expenses are not controllable at the segment level. Such expenses include certain types of professional fees, certain taxes included in operating expenses, compensation to non-employee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses, including compensation of specific groups of non-production employees. In addition, we do not allocate amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, goodwill and other asset impairment charges, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time charges and benefits. These unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations. \nOur CODM considers the operating results of each segment on a quarterly basis and uses segment operating profit predominantly to assess the performance of each segment by comparing the results of each segment with one another and to historical performance. When combined with certain other financial information, this enables the CODM to make decisions about the reporting structure, allocation of operating and capital resources, and compensation of certain employees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company revised its CODM report to enhance the presentation of segment expenses by category and to revise the allocation methodology for certain types of shared expenses. The following prior period amounts presented have been revised to align with the current year methodology. No changes were made to historically reported segment revenues.\nSee Note 19 “Segment Information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to our reportable segments. \nNorth America Segment\nThe following table summarizes revenues from external clients and operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the North America segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNorth America segment revenues \n$\n2,866,339\n \n$\n2,765,022\n \n$\n2,898,554\n \nLess:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n1,915,851 \n1,848,758 \n1,875,861 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n369,055 \n361,589 \n404,276 \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n40,009 \n43,645 \n41,516 \nNorth America segment operating profit\n$\n541,424\n \n$\n511,030\n \n$\n576,901\n \nDuring 2024, North America segment revenues increased $101.3 million, or 3.7%, from the previous year. Revenues from our North America segment represented 60.6% of total segment revenues, an increase from 58.9% reported in the corresponding period of 2023. Acquisitions contributed $95.7 million to North America segment revenues during 2024. During 2024 as compared to 2023, North America segment operating profits increased $30.4 million, or 5.9%, to $541.4 million. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, North America segment operating profit increased to 18.9% in 2024 as compared to 18.5% in 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to higher utilization and recognition of government incentives related to conducting R&D activities in Poland, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense as a percentage of segment revenues during 2024 compared to 2023. \n 38\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents North America segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n2024\n2023\nDollars \nPercentage \nIndustry Vertical\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSoftware & Hi-Tech\n$\n525,091 \n$\n552,492 \n$\n(27,401)\n(5.0)\n%\nFinancial Services\n519,986 \n538,837 \n(18,851)\n(3.5)\n%\nLife Sciences & Healthcare\n488,455 \n429,245 \n59,210 \n13.8 \n%\nConsumer Goods, Retail & Travel\n450,162 \n472,350 \n(22,188)\n(4.7)\n%\nBusiness Information & Media\n449,449 \n429,800 \n19,649 \n4.6 \n%\nEmerging Verticals\n433,196 \n342,298 \n90,898 \n26.6 \n%\nRevenues\n$\n2,866,339\n \n$\n2,765,022\n \n$\n101,317\n \n3.7\n \n%\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Software & Hi-Tech remained the largest industry vertical in the North America segment which was a result of the continued focus on engaging with our technology clients. However, a reduction in revenues from a former top 20 client impacted the revenues in this vertical. Financial Services decreased 3.5% in 2024 compared to the prior year, largely impacted by decline in demand from a group of wealth management and insurance clients. Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel declined 4.7% during 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to declines from clients in the retail industry, partially offset by growth from our travel clients. During the year ended December 31, 2024, r\nevenues from the Business Information & Media vertical experienced an increase of 4.6%\n primarily due to improvement in demand from clients in the information services and entertainment sectors. Life Sciences & Healthcare increased 13.8% during 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased demand from pharmaceutical and medical device clients. Emerging Verticals experienced 26.6% growth during 2024 compared to the prior year due to growth from various clients in industries such as energy, professional services, industrial materials, telecommunications, manufacturing and automotive. Emerging Verticals also benefited from new revenues from clients in several verticals that we gained as part of our acquisitions. \nDiscussion of North America segment operating results from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nEurope Segment \nThe following table summarizes revenues from external clients and operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Europe segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEurope segment revenues \n$\n1,861,601\n \n$\n1,909,443\n \n$\n1,853,056\n \nLess:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n1,290,317 \n1,348,190 \n1,283,398 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n267,032 \n285,722 \n323,151 \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n20,076 \n25,307 \n27,465 \nEurope segment operating profit\n$\n284,176\n \n$\n250,224\n \n$\n219,042\n \nDuring 2024, Europe segment revenues were $1.862 billion, reflecting a decrease of $47.8 million, or 2.5%, from last year. Acquisitions contributed $28.9 million to Europe segment revenues during 2024. Revenues were positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2024. Had our Europe segment revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2023, we would have reported a revenue decline of 3.0%. Revenues from our Europe segment represent 39.4% and 40.7% of total segment revenues during 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, Europe segment operating profits increased $34.0 million, or 13.6% as compared to last year, to $284.2 million. Europe segment operating profit represented 15.3% of Europe segment revenues as compared to 13.1% in 2023. Europe segment operating profit as a percentage of revenues was positively impacted by higher utilization and government incentives related to conducting R&D activities in Poland, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense and negative impact from the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2024 compared to 2023.\n 39\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents Europe segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n2024\n2023\nDollars \nPercentage \nIndustry Vertical\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nConsumer Goods, Retail & Travel\n$\n562,976 \n$\n596,830 \n$\n(33,854)\n(5.7)\n%\nFinancial Services\n502,631 \n472,146 \n30,485 \n6.5 \n%\nBusiness Information & Media\n225,148 \n323,985 \n(98,837)\n(30.5)\n%\nSoftware & Hi-Tech\n177,276 \n153,683 \n23,593 \n15.4 \n%\nLife Sciences & Healthcare\n86,150 \n60,549 \n25,601 \n42.3 \n%\nEmerging Verticals\n307,420 \n302,250 \n5,170 \n1.7 \n%\nRevenues\n$\n1,861,601\n \n$\n1,909,443\n \n$\n(47,842)\n(2.5)\n%\nConsumer Goods, Retail & Travel remained the largest industry vertical in the Europe segment during the year ended December 31, 2024. However, revenues in this vertical declined 5.7% during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to decreased demand from clients in the retail and consumer goods industries, partially offset by growth from our travel clients. During the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues in Financial Services experienced 6.5% growth primarily due to the improvement in demand from insurance and wealth management clients as well as from commercial banking clients. Financial Services also benefited from new revenues from clients that we gained as part of our acquisitions. Revenues in Business Information & Media decreased during 2024 primarily due to decreased demand from two clients who were historically included in our top-10 clients. Revenue growth in Software & Hi-Tech during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023, was largely attributable to the expansion of services provided to one of our top 10 clients. Revenues in Life Sciences & Healthcare grew 42.3% during 2024 primarily due to the growth experienced from clients in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Revenues in Emerging Verticals grew 1.7% during 2024, with growth experienced from clients in the energy industry as well as a client that was previously reported under the Russia segment and partially offset by declines from customers in the telecommunications industry.  \nDiscussion of Europe segment operating results from 2023 as compared to 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nEffects of Inflation\nEconomies in many countries where we operate have periodically experienced high rates of inflation, including during 2024. Periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition to date. We continue to track the impact of inflation, particularly on wages, while attempting to minimize its effects through pricing and cost management strategies. A higher-than-normal rate of inflation in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nOur cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations, investments to support the growth of our business and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.286 billion, short-term investments totaling $1.7 million as well as $675.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 10 “Debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the terms of our revolving credit facility and information about debt. \n 40\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in thousands)\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flow Data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n559,168 \n$\n562,634 \n$\n464,104 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(884,980)\n(66,768)\n(182,927)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(390,407)\n(165,773)\n(2,021)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(36,497)\n29,379 \n(44,867)\nNet (decrease)/increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(752,716)\n$\n359,472 \n$\n234,289 \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n2,043,108 \n1,683,636 \n1,449,347 \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n$\n1,290,392\n \n$\n2,043,108\n \n$\n1,683,636\n \nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operating activities is cash generated from our professional services that we provide to our clients. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include compensation to our employees and related costs, payments for leased facilities, various general corporate expenditures and income tax payments. Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, our operating activities included using cash on humanitarian efforts for Ukraine and geographic repositioning of our workforce. \nCash provided by operating activities in 2024 was primarily driven by the Company's cash collections from client contracts and was positively impacted by lower payments for variable compensation as compared to 2023, attributable to a lower level of financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was primarily driven by the Company's cash collections from client contracts, which was partially offset by variable compensation payments, severance payments related to the Cost Optimization Program and other working capital outflows. \nInvesting Activities\nOur primary uses of cash from investing activities consist of purchases of computer hardware, software and office equipment, as well as investments into office buildings and new businesses. We also use cash for short-term investments and time deposits and receive cash upon maturity of these deposits. Most of our investments are typically short-term and cash equivalent in nature but we may invest in longer term deposits if the terms are favorable. The cash used in investing activities during 2024 was primarily attributable to $912.2 million used for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, and $32.1 million used for capital expenditures compared to $24.8 million used for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired and $28.4 million used for capital expenditures during 2023. The use of cash from investing activities was partially offset by inflows of $61.5 million from matured investments in time deposits during 2024, compared to $10.9 million during 2023. \nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities mainly consists of repurchasing shares of EPAM common stock under our share repurchase programs, payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, repayments of debt, and settlements of the acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions of businesses. Cash provided by financing activities mainly consists of the proceeds from the purchases of shares under our ESPP and exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans as well as proceeds from debt. We typically do not rely on debt to supplement our cash flows. Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to $398.0 million of payments to repurchase our common stock during 2024 compared to $164.9 million during 2023. In addition, during 2024 we used cash for the payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units of $35.2 million, compared to $29.1 million paid during 2023. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash received from the exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans and proceeds from the purchases of shares under our ESPP of $53.7 million during 2024, compared to $51.6 million received during 2023.\n Discussion of the comparison of the cash flows between 2023 and 2022 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n 41\nTable of Contents\nFuture Capital Requirements\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. However, the invasion of Ukraine, other various geopolitical events, and the related measures to contain their impact, have caused and may continue to cause material disruptions in financial markets and economies. These disruptions may increase our costs of capital, decrease returns on investment, and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors including the impact of the invasion of Ukraine, as described elsewhere in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. To the extent that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and operating cash flows are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. If we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business and there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. \nSee Note 9 “Leases”, Note 10 “Debt”, Note 18 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our various contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements. \nOff-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements\nWe do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in Note 18 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.",
