We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Our customers range from small-and-medium-sized businesses to large global enterprises and governmental entities. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers.\nWe use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.\nOur Strategy\n \nOver the last several years, new megatrends around edge, cloud, data, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) have emerged to shape customer expectations for enterprise technology. First, data at the edge is increasing exponentially, driven by the proliferation of devices that require secure connectivity to enable reliable digital experiences. Second, enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever they live across a distributed enterprise. Third, data growth is creating countless new opportunities to generate meaningful business insights. Finally, HPE is seeing a significant technology shift as customers realize the fundamental potential of AI technology to deliver business transformation.  \nIn concert with these trends, enterprises are consuming their technology differently. Increasingly, customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the information technology (“IT”) they use. \nThe megatrends are ushering in long-lasting changes to IT, including accelerating hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Customers across industry verticals are interested in unifying all the applications and data with a consistent cloud experience.\nCustomers also want to better extract value from their growing stores of rapidly evolving data, knowing that actionable insights from data are critical to deliver business transformations. Data is becoming more unstructured, more time-sensitive, and more distributed. Frequently, data is siloed and spread across different multi-generational IT systems, often trapped in critical legacy architecture. Many organizations cannot adequately gain insights from their data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications. Customers need a data-first modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud.\nHPE has deployed an edge-to-cloud strategy that capitalizes on emergent megatrends and delivers a data-first modernization approach for customers. Our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company has led us to innovate our solutions across networking connectivity, cloud, and data, delivered as-a-service (“aaS”) through the HPE GreenLake cloud. We have shifted our mix of products and services, and how we deliver that mix to customers. HPE has evolved to a platform-based model, fueled by a portfolio richer in software and services. In hybrid cloud, we have redefined the cloud space by delivering an experience that is hybrid by design with our HPE GreenLake cloud as the centerpiece of our strategy; it accelerates multi-generation IT transformation through a unified cloud-native and AI-driven experience that empowers customers to access, analyze, and extract value from their data across public clouds, data centers, colocation facilities, and at the edge. The AI market requires a modern and high-performing networking fabric as a core foundation to deliver a more efficient data-center cloud, which we offer through our AI-driven portfolio of networking solutions. Our server business supports both traditional servers and those meant to enable AI workloads with decades of large-scale infrastructure expertise, including technologies like direct liquid cooling that are powering some of our largest AI systems. Our Financial Services (“FS”) business complements our solution offerings by helping customers unlock financial capacity.\nWe recognize the AI market will be driven by computational capability, data-intensive workloads, and the need for specialized architecture; thus, we have been targeting, and continue to target three areas: supercomputing, AI infrastructure, and AI platform software. We seek to seize this AI market opportunity by innovating in networking, hybrid cloud and AI – which are all essential building blocks to deliver a unified technology experience. We believe that we are differentiated from our competition by our unique and compelling value proposition, which positions us to capture significant value from the growing AI market through our intellectual property portfolio, trusted expertise, and long-term sustained market leadership in supercomputing. \nThe pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, Inc. (\"Juniper Networks\") further supports the aforementioned strategies and enables us to execute on them. We believe this acquisition will accelerate our edge-to-cloud vision with a full networking IP stack: from silicon, to infrastructure, to the operating system, to security, to software and services, in a cloud-native and AI-\n2\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\ndriven approach. Furthermore, through this strategic acquisition, we seek to deliver secure, AI-driven networking solutions, which will be foundational to delivering fully integrated hybrid cloud and AI solutions.\nOur Business Segments, Products and Services \nOur operations are organized into five reportable business segments: Server, Hybrid Cloud, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services, and Corporate Investments and Other. The class of similar product categories within each segment which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue in each of the past three years was as follows:\n•\nFiscal 2024 - Server products, Server services, Intelligent Edge products, Hybrid Cloud products\n•\nFiscal 2023 - Server products, Intelligent Edge products, Server services, Hybrid Cloud products\n•\nFiscal 2022 - Server products, Server services, Hybrid Cloud products, Intelligent Edge products\nThe Company had\n \ntwo distributors which represented approximately 14% and 11% of the Company's total net revenue in fiscal 2024, primarily within the Intelligent Edge and Server segments. \nA summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. A discussion of certain factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”\nServer\nOur Server segment offerings consist of general-purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload-optimized servers to deliver the high performance and value for demanding applications, and integrated systems comprised of software and hardware designed to address high-performance computing and supercomputing (including exascale applications), artificial intelligence, data analytics, and transaction processing workloads for government and commercial customers globally.

In private cloud, our Private Cloud Enterprise offerings include new cloud-native offerings and capabilities for virtual machines, containers, and bare metal; a full suite of private cloud offerings that enable customers to self-manage or choose a fully managed experience. In fiscal 2024, we launched a new offering, Private Cloud AI, that captures the emerging enterprise model fine-tuning, retrieval augmented generation and inference markets for AI solutions. Private Cloud AI is fully integrated, standardized offer that has been co-developed with AI market leader Nvidia, with the goal to provide an out of the box solution for enterprise AI. This segment also provides self-service private cloud on-demand with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition. Infrastructure software includes monitoring and observability for day two operations and beyond through our acquisition of OpsRamp and unified data access through our HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric and analytics suite, which helps move and transform data for use in AI and other applications. Hybrid Cloud segment also includes data lifecycle management and protection through our suite of offerings, including Zerto Disaster Recovery. \nIntelligent Edge\nThe Intelligent Edge segment offers wired and wireless local area networks, campus, branch, and data center switching, software-defined wide-area-networks, private and public cellular network software, network security, and associated services that enable secure connectivity for businesses of any size. The HPE Aruba Networking product portfolio includes hardware products such as Wi-Fi access points, switches, and gateways. The HPE Aruba Networking software and services portfolio includes cloud-based management, network management, network access control, software-defined wide-area networking, network security, analytics and assurance, location services software, private and public cellular core software, and professional and support services, as well as aaS and consumption models through the HPE GreenLake cloud for the Intelligent Edge portfolio of products. Intelligent Edge offerings are consolidated in the edge service platform, which takes a cloud-native approach that provides customers with a unified framework to meet their connectivity, security, and financial needs across campus, branch, data center, and remote worker environments. Upon closing of the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, we expect to offer an even more comprehensive portfolio of networking solutions.\n3\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\n \nFinancial Services\nFinancial Services (“FS”)\n \nprovides flexible investment solutions, such as leasing, financing, IT consumption, utility programs, and asset management services for customers that facilitate unique technology deployment models and the acquisition of complete IT solutions, including hardware, software, and services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and others. FS also supports financial solutions for on-premise flexible consumption models, such as the HPE GreenLake cloud. \nCorporate Investments and Other \nCorporate Investments and Other includes the Advisory and Professional Services business, which primarily offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation services as well as complex solution engagement capabilities; the Communications and Media Solutions business, which primarily offers software and related services to the telecommunications industry; and Hewlett Packard Labs, which is responsible for research and development.\nOur Strengths\n \nWe believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including:\n•\nEdge-to-cloud strategy and solutions uniquely solve customer challenges. \nAs data grows and evolves, enterprises become increasingly distributed, and customers realize the potential in AI technology, HPE’s edge-to-cloud strategy is uniquely designed to enable customers to securely access, control, and maximize the value of all their workloads and data assets to accelerate business outcomes. The HPE GreenLake cloud is an open, secure, fully integrated platform that brings a unified experience across the edge, data center, colocation, and cloud. It is automated and easy to consume with capacity available to scale up and down on demand. It offers true pay per use consumption so customers only pay for what they use, and they can have the entire hybrid cloud experience managed for them through our HPE Managed Services offerings.\n•\nComprehensive portfolio. \nWe have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and capabilities to help accelerate our customers' digital transformations and help them capture the opportunity that AI presents for their businesses. We combine our software-defined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a comprehensive IT strategy and connect our customers' data from edge to cloud, through our high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a single package, is one of our principal differentiators.\n•\nDifferentiated consumption-based IT solutions for a growing opportunity.\n Enterprises of all sizes are looking to digitally transform in order to develop next-generation cloud-native applications, create actionable insights from their data, and drive business growth, but they face many challenges including lack of in-house IT skills, limited budgets and options for financing, and lack of flexibility to choose the technology foundation that best meets their needs. Consumption-based IT offers solutions to these challenges by providing greater agility, which empowers people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation by leveraging insights from their data, while also eliminating capital and operating expenses tied to infrastructure over-provisioning. HPE is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumption-based IT experience. \n•\nOpen platforms. \nThe world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of centers of data everywhere, which are highly decentralized and distributed. This shift demands a unified cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to customers’ data sources to create real-time insights everywhere. We believe the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all our customers' clouds, rather than requiring customers to be locked into a cloud stack. \n•\nMulti-year innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet.\n We have been in the technology and innovation business for over 80 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments such as cloud, artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and cybersecurity to drive business transformations now and in the future. We also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provide the financial flexibility and speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.\n•\nGlobal distribution and partner ecosystem. \nWe are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor, and/or multi-language environments. We have expansive go-to-market capabilities, including a large ecosystem of channel partners, which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world. Our HPE GreenLake cloud provides open cloud application programming interfaces to our partners, enabling them to better offer their unique solutions to customers. \n4\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\n•\nCustom financial solutions. \nThrough our FS segment, we help customers create investment capacity to accelerate their transformations by helping them free up capital, capture value from older assets, achieve sustainability goals, invest in new technologies aaS, and weather financial volatility. FS is also an enabler of our consumption-based IT models by helping spread our upfront solution costs over the duration of the customer contract. Through FS’ Technology Renewal Centers, we are helping customers achieve their own sustainability goals by refurbishing technology assets for reuse. \n•\nExperienced leadership team. \nOur management team has an extensive track record of performance and execution. We are led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Antonio Neri, who has proven experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands, and driving sustained growth and expansion in the technology industry. Mr. Neri's experience includes more than 25 years combined at HPE and Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP Co.”) in various leadership positions. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise IT business and the markets in which we compete. \nSales, Marketing, and Distribution \nWe manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners, including:\n•\nresellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups;\n•\ndistribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;\n•\noriginal equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that integrate our products and services with their own products and services, and sell the integrated solution;\n•\nindependent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products;\n•\nsystems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and\n•\nadvisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services.\nThe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing, and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. This has resulted in a combined go-to-market model, in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries, while we sell and deliver our products, solutions, and services through a channel-only model in the remaining countries. In those countries where we have a direct sales presence, we follow a bifurcated sales operational model with separate go-to-market routes for high-velocity, transactional hardware sales, on the one hand and for services and solutions, on the other hand. Also, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers, our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts, both in the commercial and public sector space.\nManufacturing and Materials \n \nWe utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design. The use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand. In addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. \nHistorically, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.\n5\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\nWe purchase materials, supplies, and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on single-source suppliers for certain customized parts (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption) and a disruption or loss of a single-source supplier could delay production of some products. In some instances, our single-source suppliers (e.g., Intel and AMD as suppliers of certain x86 processors) are also the single-source suppliers for the entire market; disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors.\nLike other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin, but does not generally disrupt production. We also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints, or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly.”\nWe rely on proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position ourselves well for availability of those components. We intend to take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand, and plan to continue leveraging strong partnerships and long-term agreements with our suppliers.\nBacklog \nBacklog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period. Orders reflected in backlog are subject to adjustment, including as a result of re-bookings, cancellations and fulfillment issues, which may impact backlog. \nThe adverse impact of the global pandemic on the supply chain has moderated, resulting in a more balanced supply-and-demand environment and improved component availability. Challenges in global logistics have mostly normalized despite some uncertainty related to regional conflicts and port labor disputes. Our overall demand pipeline has improved since the beginning of fiscal 2024 as customers have been digesting through their inventory. Even though demand across our AI product portfolio, including for high performance graphics and accelerated processing units, continues to be somewhat uneven, due to the lumpiness of deals that can cause fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, AI systems demand in the midst of persisting data center space availability constraints continued to drive significant AI backlog. The supply and demand environment for GPUs continues to remain uneven as the market navigates transition to next generation GPUs. These dynamics have resulted in our inventory levels being elevated as compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, and we are closely monitoring inventory levels as the market navigates a transition to next-generation GPUs.\nInternational \nOur products and services are available worldwide. We believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. \nA summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. Approximately 64% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2024 came from sales outside the United States.\nFor a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings “Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition,” and “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” in Item 7A of Part II, and Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\n6\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\nResearch and Development \nInnovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts (“R&D”) are focused on designing and developing products, services, and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences. \nExpenditures for R&D were $2.2 billion in fiscal 2024, $2.3 billion fiscal 2023, and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products, services, and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position.\nIncluded in the R&D work currently taking place at the Company are the following initiatives:\nIn Server, we are developing high-quality next-generation compute solutions that encompass servers, server-attached options, and software, integrating the latest industry technology and aligning with our customers' evolving needs. Furthermore, we are advancing our SaaS capabilities by creating cloud-native, cloud-based server management solutions to enhance our existing portfolio. In the high performance computing and AI sector, our investments are focused on pioneering leadership computing solutions that deliver superior performance and efficiency. These solutions feature leading edge silicon architectures, high-speed interconnects, advanced storage and innovative direct liquid cooling. Our R&D efforts in the realm of AI are particularly robust, with new server solutions designed for AI inference engines and integrated into larger HPE Private Cloud AI for inferencing, retrieval augmented generation, and model fine-tuning. Large-scale model training and tuning, including natural language processing, large language models, and multi-modal training for models with trillions of parameters are supported by our leading AI solutions. These efforts are bolstered by the development of high-performance computing tools, cloud-native and scalable cluster management software, and transaction processing software, which have been instrumental in achieving our milestone of delivering the world's first exascale supercomputer.\nIn Hybrid Cloud, we are investing in a comprehensive portfolio of storage and private cloud technologies and capabilities that are focused on enabling customers to transform through the power of data and AI, modernize their IT infrastructure and simplify hybrid operations, delivering a cloud operational experience via the HPE GreenLake cloud. We continue to invest in the storage portfolio aligned with the customers evolving data and AI needs. We have extended the deployment model from on-premise and cloud-adjacent to include software-defined cloud native deployments in Amazon Web Services. In private cloud, we are developing fully integrated hardware-software offers that simplify day-to-day management, operations and data protection, enables an on-premise public-cloud like experience while addressing security, privacy, governance, and regulatory compliance needs. The investment includes airgapped/disconnected offers and offers for heavy data traffic and latency requirements at the edge. In the AI space, we have invested in building turn-key integrated systems co-engineered with Nvidia that integrate HPE AI hardware and software technologies with Nvidia technologies to radically increase time to value of GenAI capabilities optimized for inferencing, retrieval augmented generation, and model fine-tuning. We have expanded our cloud observability and orchestration capabilities and virtualization options through the acquisitions of OpsRamp (observability) and Morpheus (orchestration), extending our ability to simplify IT complexity in multi-cloud and multi-vendor environments. Finally, we have been rapidly developing an enterprise-grade hypervisor for virtual machines, along with the ability to manage cloud-native applications using containerization, or specialized workload needs with bare metal as a service.\nIn Intelligent Edge, we are investing in a broad portfolio of networking and security capabilities, addressing remote, branch, campus, data center, and cloud use cases. We are expanding our wireless access portfolio to include new Wi-Fi (e.g., Wi-Fi 7) and private cellular (4G, LTE, and 5G) products to complement our existing portfolio. We have expanded our security capabilities with last year’s acquisition of Secure Service Edge (“SSE”) provider Axis Security and delivering stand-alone SSE, and integrating security with our software-defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”) capabilities to deliver a single-vendor Secure Access Services Edge solution. In our Ethernet Switch portfolio, we are investing in new Data Center Networking platforms and features to expand our total addressable market to complement the campus and branch segment. We leverage the HPE GreenLake cloud to provide consistent access to our aaS capabilities and enable new business models, including network-as-a-service. We also are investing in automation, machine learning, and AI-based network operations to optimize user experience and improve operator efficiency, as exemplified by our cloud-native Aruba Central cloud service, which is expected to provide manageability across our entire portfolio, including Wireless LAN, Ethernet switching, SD-WAN, and security. \nIn Hewlett Packard Labs, we are focused on disruptive innovation and applied research in collaboration with other HPE business groups to deliver differentiated intellectual property. Our innovation agenda is focused on developing technologies in the areas of system architecture, networking, AI, sustainability, edge-to-cloud, quantum computing, and sustainability. We also continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the development and delivery of our technology.\n7\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to our R&D activities, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including offering our entire portfolio aaS, our business, operating results, and financial performance may suffer.”\nPatents \nOur general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. As of October 31, 2024, our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13,000 issued and pending patents.\nPatents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments.\nIn addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see “Risk factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings “Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” and “Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.” \nSeasonality\nFrom time to time, the markets in which we sell our products, services, and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See \n“Risk factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading\n “Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.”\nCompetition\nWe have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products, solutions, and services which includes our aaS offerings. We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, and the availability of our IT infrastructure offerings.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are relatively short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture, and market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.\nThe competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below:\nServer \nbusiness operates in the highly competitive enterprise data center infrastructure market and the markets for data-intensive high performance supercomputing, analytics, and artificial intelligence infrastructure solutions, which are characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation. Our primary competitors in data center infrastructure are technology vendors, such as Dell Technologies Inc., Super Micro Computer, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd.

Our primary IT Asset Disposition (“ITAD”) competitors are ERI, Ingram Micro, Sage Sustainable Electronics, and Sims Recycling Solutions. We believe our competitive advantage over banks, other financial institutions, and ITAD providers is our ability to bring together our investment solutions with our expertise in managing technology assets. Not only are we able to deliver investment solutions that help customers create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs, but we also help them extract value from existing IT investments while more efficiently managing the retirement of those assets. All of these solutions can help customers accelerate digital transformation, create new budget streams, and meet Circular Economy objectives. \nFor a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see “Risk factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.”\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt HPE we are united by our purpose, which is to advance the way people live and work. We believe technology’s greatest promise lies in its potential for positive change. This is the guidepost for each decision we make at HPE. We believe it not only helps guide our contribution to society, but also makes good business sense. Our company strives to be an engine of innovation, and our approximately 61,000 employees as of October 31, 2024, are proud of the ways our technology enables our customers to achieve meaningful outcomes like curing disease, modernizing farming, addressing world-hunger, and democratizing transportation through autonomous vehicles. \nOur Culture\n - We recognize the importance of talent and culture to the success of HPE and our ability to fulfill our purpose. We have identified four key cultural beliefs that guide how we lead on a daily basis: accelerating what’s next, bold moves, the “power of yes we can,” and being a force for good. We embed these beliefs in a deep-rooted DNA that puts customers first, enabling us to partner, innovate, and act with integrity. HPE has remained committed to its focus on internalizing these values into a vibrant culture that creates a superior team member experience and a highly engaged workforce, driving improvements across our communications, our reward programs, our talent/performance programs, and our work environment. Through such efforts, we aim to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and inspiring experience for all our team members and to make HPE a destination for talent while driving high-performance and growth opportunities for our team members, and innovation and excellence for our customers. In the midst of the above, we continually seek feedback from our team members to better understand and improve their experiences and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion - \nAt HPE, we are committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace. By fostering a culture where our people can freely contribute their perspectives, ideas, and experiences, we can fuel innovation, drive transformational changes, and be a force for good by harnessing the potential of our technologies and our team members. In 2024, we continued to advance our global approach of enhancing the composition of our workforce, by selecting regional leaders responsible for engaging team members, core human resources professionals, business stakeholders, and external \n9\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\npartners to identify areas of focus to advance unconditional inclusion. We also expanded our voluntary, and confidential self-identification program, “Count me in. I belong!” from the US, Puerto Rico and the U.K, to include Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia and India for the first time. We continue to develop new and inclusive pipelines of talent in science, technology, engineering, and math (“STEM”) professions through our dedicated HPE STEM Discovery Program. This program equips and enables HPE team members to serve as STEM education and digital inclusion volunteers in their local communities, exposing learners to cutting-edge technology and raising awareness about careers in technology. The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Voice of the Workforce index within our annual global engagement survey continued to reveal strong engagement scores across our ethnically diverse and female team members. Our Board, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Executive Committee model high standards for our efforts to drive an unconditionally inclusive environment and oversee efforts throughout the Company leadership to continuously develop their inclusive leadership acumen.\nTalent \n- We are dedicated to attracting, developing, and retaining top talent through substantial investment. Our commitment extends to all career stages. We establish transparent goals, promote accountability, and continuously evaluate and nurture talent. About 95% of employees engaged in HPE’s “My Success Plan” program, which entails quarterly 1:1 conversations with leaders, centered on performance, progress, and career aspirations. The dynamic nature of our industry allows team members to thrive in their current roles while acquiring new skills. Over the past year, our approximately 61,000 team members completed over 821,000 online and instructor-led courses across various categories, including leadership, inclusion and diversity, professional skills, technical training, and compliance. We are particularly focused on identifying and cultivating the next generation of exceptional leaders, emphasizing technical expertise. Our annual talent and succession review, conducted with our CEO and Executive Committee, aims to accelerate talent development, enhance succession pipelines, and improve diversity in our key positions. \nPay Equity\n - We believe people should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We maintain policies to promote equal pay, and we regularly review our global pay practices with an aim to pay team members in similar roles and locations commensurately with their experience and responsibilities. We partner with independent third-party experts to conduct annual pay assessments and identify unexplained gaps between our present state and our goal of equitable pay treatment for all team members. Where these reviews identify such gaps at a country-wide level, we adjust compensation to eliminate the gap. As a result of our efforts, our most recent pay equity review demonstrated that we have achieved pay parity for base compensation and bonus targets between male and female team members in the U.S. (including among underrepresented ethnicities), and a dozen additional countries throughout the world, when accounting for job title, time-in-role, experience, and location. We conduct a number of compensation analyses in other countries to provide competitive and equitable pay. \nWork That Fits Your Life\n - This global initiative, which was launched in 2019, is an important example of how HPE is investing in our culture and creating a team member experience that aims to make HPE a destination of choice for the best talent in the industry. It includes an industry-leading paid parental leave program (minimum 6 months), part-time work opportunities for new parents or team members transitioning to retirement, and “Wellness Fridays” that allows team members a full Friday off four times per year to focus on their well-being. The HPE Global Wellness Program is a comprehensive program that promotes overall health and well-being by providing team members with programs and resources that offer flexibility built around team member needs while continuing to deliver on critical business results. The program consists of four pillars: physical health, financial well-being, mental and emotional health, and community well-being. Additionally, we offer a hybrid work environment for the majority of our team members, encouraging two days in the office per week for collaboration.\nTotal Rewards\n - HPE requires a uniquely talented workforce and is committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance based, designed to drive innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.\nBoard Oversight\n - Our Board of Directors oversees our human capital management strategy and programs. Our HR and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our human resources and workforce management programs, including but not limited to those related to corporate culture; compensation plans and policies; diversity and inclusion; and talent acquisition, development, and retention.\nHPE’s strong and healthy culture is critical to accelerating what’s next for our customers and partners – and the success of our company. We believe that a workforce that is energized and more engaged will fuel our ability to pivot and grow, which will, in turn, power the next chapter at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n10\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\nEnvironmental Sustainability \nLiving Progress is our business strategy for creating sustainable and responsible IT solutions that meet the technology demands of the future, while advancing the way people live and work. Anchored to our edge-to-cloud offerings and bolstered by our sustainability credentials, our Living Progress strategy provides us with a competitive advantage in the market as we help our customers achieve not only their business objectives, but also their IT sustainability goals. A legacy of sustainability leadership supports talent acquisition and retention and enables ongoing access to global markets. The HPE Board of Directors, including through its committees, provides oversight of our Living Progress strategy, risks, practices, policies, and disclosures, to support integration with our core business strategy. \nSustainability performance is a core business discipline within HPE. HPE aims to become a net-zero enterprise by 2040, with interim targets set across our value chain for 2030. These climate targets are approved by the Science Based Target initiative and align with the latest climate science. Our commitment is supported by our Net-Zero Roadmap, which defines the levers we plan to prioritize to enable us to deliver on our near- and long-term carbon emissions reduction targets and outlines key assumptions with respect to our reduction targets.\nIn 2024, the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions resulted from our customers' use of our products and solutions. We recognize the opportunity to innovate technologies for a carbon-constrained world and are committed to delivering products and solutions that empower our customers to reduce the carbon footprints of their IT estates while also gaining maximum productivity from their IT investments and reducing costs. For instance, the latest generation of HPE ProLiant Gen 11 Servers enables customers to consolidate and grow compute capabilities while lowering the cost of power, cooling, floor space, and licensing. \nTo enable market access across the globe and aid customers in selecting more sustainable IT solutions, many of our products are certified by eco-labels such as Electronic Product Environment Assessment Tool, Energy STAR, China SEPA and the China Energy Conservation Program. \nSupply Chain Responsibility and Human Rights \nWe manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for our customers, partners, and suppliers. We are conscious of the importance of the responsible use of our products. In an effort to prevent intended and unintended harm, we continue to consider who purchases our offerings and how they are used by, among other things, limiting features, including responsible use clauses, monitoring for risk of alternate end uses, and promoting deployment of AI with safeguards, such as user training and ongoing checks and refinement to mitigate bias and improve accuracy.\nHuman rights principles are embedded in how we do business, and we are committed to holding our entire value chain to high ethical standards that respect such principles. We have processes in place to enable the early detection of forced labor and have implemented due diligence procedures to monitor and help prevent human rights violations or abuses at our suppliers and in our operations. Additionally, through our Responsible Minerals Program, we work to advance the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products and within our supply chain.\nOur commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion extends beyond our workforce and to our suppliers, as well. We believe a diverse supply chain and equity in sourcing not only creates opportunities for underrepresented and underserved communities, but also contributes to the resiliency of our supply chain and of our communities.\nWe are also committed to the responsible and ethical development and deployment of new technologies to advance how we live and work, and we continue to build on our existing responsible development work, particularly in relation to AI. We have an executive level AI Ethics Responsibility Committee and an operational AI Ethics Working Group, through which we aim to align the development, deployment, and use of AI with HPE's AI Ethical Principles, promoting privacy-enabled and secure, human focused, inclusive, robust, and responsible use of AI. In 2022, we refined our approach to assessing ethical AI and rolled out AI Ethical Principles training. In 2023, we further advanced this initiative by launching three new sub-committees to help us operationalize our principles for: Products (AI we develop), Processes (AI we source to use), and Partnerships (AI we source to incorporate into our solutions). In 2024, we rolled out a broader AI Governance model and developed tools to drive efficiency in the AI ethics assessment process.\nWhile the HPE Board of Directors and all of its committees take an integrated, rather than siloed, approach to providing oversight of Living Progress matters, including environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, and human rights, our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of our broader Living Progress strategy, initiatives, risks, and policies.\n11\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\nMaterial Government Regulations \nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that global trade and certain environmental regulations could potentially materially impact our business.\nEnvironment \nOur products and operations are, or may in the future be, subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including, among others, laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment and emissions-related reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites; product compliance and safety, such as repairability, chemical composition, packaging and labeling; energy consumption of our products and services; and the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances. We proactively evaluate, and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment. We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain repairability requirements or financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as “product take-back legislation”). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, reusing or recycling. Finally, as climate change and other environmental-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. In the event our products are impacted by these laws or standards, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and other environmental-related issues, and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and treaties. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental and environmental-related laws applicable to our operations, products and services, and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We support this commitment with a range of comprehensive policies, including relating to environmental, health and safety, climate, water, and electronic waste; a strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services; an extensive supply chain responsibility program; and an approach to ethical standards and strong governance that are the foundations of our business.\nGlobal Trade \nAs a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world. Such laws, rules, and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or the need to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally. We continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that will continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements. \nFor a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact us, see “Regulatory and Government Risks” within “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I. \nAdditional Information\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may include trademarks and trade names owned by other parties, and all other such trademarks and trade names mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.\n12\nTable of Conte\nn\nt\nInformation about our Executive Officers \nThe following are our current executive officers:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nAntonio Neri\n57\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nMarie Myers\n56\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nJohn F.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFor purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) section, we use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. \nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Discussions of fiscal 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on December 22, 2023, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. \nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in certain key items in these financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for these changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.\nThis MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nTrends and Uncertainties.\n A discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management, such as the mixed macroeconomic environment of supply chain constraints (though easing), uneven demand across our portfolio, increased demand for and adoption of new technologies, conservative (though recovering) customer spending environment, persistent inflation, foreign exchange pressures, recent tax developments, and pending merger with Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks”). \n•\nExecutive Overview. \nA discussion of our business and a summary of our financial performance and other highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company in order to provide context to the remainder of the MD&A.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates. \nA discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.\n•\nResults of Operations. \nA discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a discussion of the results of operations at the segment level.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\n An analysis of changes in our cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, and cash requirements and commitments.\n•\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n. Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This section also includes a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring fiscal 2024, the effects of the evolving macroeconomic environment on demand persisted and certain significant developments impacted our operations as follows:\nTechnological Advancements: \nWe have observed market trends and demand (of customers of various segments and sizes) gravitating towards artificial intelligence (“AI”), hybrid cloud, edge computing, data security capabilities, and related offerings. The volume of data at the edge continues to grow, driven by the proliferation of more devices. The need for a unified cloud experience everywhere has grown, as well, in order to manage the growth of data at the edge. With the abundance of data, there are opportunities to develop AI tools with powerful computational abilities to extract insights and value from the captured data. Increasing demand for AI is also contributing to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors and emerging competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions and exerting increased competitive pressure. We expect these market dynamics and trends to continue in the longer term.\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty:\n The effect of the evolving macroeconomic environment has been impacting industry-wide demand, as customers take longer to work through prior orders and have been adopting a more conservative approach to discretionary IT spending. This has resulted in uneven demand across our portfolio and geographies, particularly for certain of our hardware offerings, as customers have focused investments on modernizing infrastructure, such as migrating to cloud-based \n41\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nofferings, including our own. We expect such mixed macroeconomic environment to largely continue (though ease slightly) and possibly limit revenue growth in the near term.\nSupply Chain: \nDuring fiscal 2024, we experienced supply chain constraints for certain components, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and accelerated processing units, but they have since eased, in part due to increased availability of supply and lower material and logistics costs. Logistics costs decreased from previously elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the freight network. We have, in fact, been experiencing higher-than-normal inventory levels, primarily due to customers transitioning to the next generation of GPUs, our securing supply ahead of demand, and longer customer acceptance timelines on AI-related orders; we expect this trend to continue in the medium term. We have experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, rising input component costs and a competitive pricing environment, which may impact our financial results. We plan to mitigate the impact of these dynamics through continued disciplined cost and pricing management. \nRecurring Revenue and Consumption Models:\n We continue to strengthen our core server and storage-oriented offerings and expand our offerings on the HPE GreenLake cloud, to deliver our entire portfolio as-a-service (“aaS”) and become the edge-to-cloud company for our customers and partners. We expect that such flexible consumption model will continue to strengthen our customer relationships and contribute to growth in recurring revenue. \nForeign Currency Exposure:\n We have a large global presence, with more than half of our revenue generated outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize foreign currency impacts.\nRecent Tax Developments: \nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. To date, 43 countries have enacted portions, or all, of the OECD proposal and a further 22 countries have drafted, or have announced an intent to draft, legislation enacting the proposed rules. Where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for us in fiscal 2025. Under US GAAP, the OECD Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. As a result, there was no impact to our fiscal 2024 results. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. We currently do not expect a material impact to our fiscal 2025 results.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting audits of our fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. During fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments (“NOPAs”) for 2017, 2018, and 2019 relating to our intercompany transfer pricing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. However, we disagreed with the IRS’ adjustments and believe the positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to prevail on technical merits and have continued with settlement discussions with the IRS. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we submitted a formal settlement offer to the IRS to facilitate the closing of the audit and recorded increased reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $122 million. The impact of the increase in reserves is almost entirely offset with a valuation allowance release, and the net impact to income tax expense for fiscal 2024 was not material. It is reasonably possible that the IRS audit for fiscal 2017 through 2019 may be concluded in the next 12 months, and it is reasonably possible that existing unrecognized tax benefits related to these years may be reduced by an amount up to $358 million within the next 12 months, the majority of which relates to adjustments to foreign tax credits that carry a full valuation allowance or to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition, neither of which affects the Company’s effective tax rate.\nOther Trends and Uncertainties: \nThe impacts of \ntrade\n protection measures, including increases in tariffs and trade barriers, changes in government policies and international trade arrangements, geopolitical volatility (including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East), and global macroeconomic challenges (including the relationship between China and the U.S.), may impact our operations, financial performance, and ability to conduct business in some non-U.S. markets. \nWe monitor and seek to mitigate these risks with adjustments to our manufacturing, supply chain, and distribution networks.\n42\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nPending Merger with Juniper Networks, Inc: \nOn January 9, \n2024\n, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) under which we will acquire Juniper Networks in an all-cash transaction for $40.00 per share (the “Merger”), representing an equity value of approximately $14 billion. On April 2, 2024, Juniper Networks shareholders approved the transaction. The transaction is expected to be funded based on senior unsecured delayed draw term loans from a syndicate of banks, the post-tax proceeds from our sale to Unisplendour International Technology Limited (“UNIS”) of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C Technologies Co., Limited (“H3C”), the net proceeds (including after repayments of maturing debt) of our September 2024 issuances of senior unsecured notes and the Preferred Stock (as further described in Note 15, “Stockholders’ Equity” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II), and cash on the balance sheet. The closing of the transaction remains subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nFor further information about the Merger, see Note 10, “\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\n” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, and for further discussion about the risks related to the Merger, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe foregoing summary of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10, 2024.\nThe following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal \n2024\n to fiscal \n2023\n, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and, Cash Requirements and Commitments sections present information as of October 31, 2024, unless otherwise noted.\n \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNet revenue of $30.1 billion represented an increase of 3.4% \n(increased 3.3% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to higher average unit prices (“AUPs”) in the Server segment, moderated by lower volume and product mix effect in the Intelligent Edge segment. The gross profit margin of 32.8% (or $9.9 billion) represents a decrease of 2.3 percentage points from the prior-year period due to decline in revenue in the Intelligent Edge segment and higher mix of lower margin products in the Server segment. The operating profit margin of \n7.3% \nwas relatively flat as compared to the prior-year period.\nFinancial Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated GAAP financial results:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nNet revenue\n$\n30,127 \n$\n29,135 \n3.4%\nGross profit\n$\n9,878 \n$\n10,239 \n(3.5)%\nGross profit margin\n32.8 \n%\n35.1 \n%\n(2.3)pts\nEarnings from operations\n$\n2,190 \n$\n2,089 \n4.8%\nOperating profit margin\n7.3 \n%\n7.2 \n%\n0.1pts\nNet earnings attributable to HPE\n$\n2,579 \n$\n2,025 \n27.4%\nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders\n2,554 \n2,025 \n26.1%\nDiluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders\n(1)\n1.93 \n1.54 \n$0.39\nCash flow from operations\n$\n4,341 \n$\n4,428 \n$(87)\n43\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated non-GAAP financial results:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nNet revenue in constant currency\n$\n30,107 \n$\n29,135 \n3.3%\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n9,893 \n$\n10,273 \n(3.7)%\nNon-GAAP gross profit margin\n32.8 \n%\n35.3 \n%\n(2.5)pts\nNon-GAAP earnings from operations\n$\n3,168 \n$\n3,145 \n0.7%\nNon-GAAP operating profit margin\n10.5 \n%\n10.8 \n%\n(0.3)pts\nNon-GAAP net earnings attributable to HPE\n$\n2,655 \n$\n2,832 \n(6.3)%\nNon-GAAP net earnings attributable to common stockholders\n2,630 \n2,832 \n(7.1)%\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders\n(1)\n1.99 \n2.15 \n$(0.16)\nFree cash flow\n$\n2,297 \n$\n2,238 \n$59\n(1)\nFor purposes of calculating diluted net EPS, the preferred stock dividends are added back to the net earnings attributable to common stockholders and the diluted weighted average share calculation assumes the preferred stock was converted at issuance or as of the beginning of the reporting period.\nEach non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure herein. Please refer to the section “GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations” included in this MD&A for these reconciliations, a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nAnnualized Revenue Run-rate (“ARR”)\nOur pivot to aaS continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake cloud services. Our mix of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our HPE GreenLake cloud, which is improving our margin profile. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake cloud services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds. \nARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake cloud services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), software consumption revenue, and other aaS offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We believe that ARR is a metric that allows management to better understand and highlight the potential future performance of our aaS business. We also believe ARR provides investors with greater transparency to our financial information and of the performance metric used in our financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes of management.” We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.\nARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.\nThe following table presents our ARR:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\nDollars in millions\nARR\n$\n1,938 \n$\n1,304 \nYear-over-year growth rate\n49 \n%\n39 \n%\nThe 49% year over year increase in ARR was primarily due to growth in our Hybrid Cloud, Server and Intelligent Edge segments, which was due to an expanding customer installed base, an expanded range of HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions, Server aaS, and Intelligent Edge aaS activity.\n44\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCapital Returns to Shareholders\nReturning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, which also consists of strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. As of October 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $15.1 billion, compared to $4.6 billion as of October 31, 2023, representing an increase of $10.5 billion. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEstimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nWe believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services. \nThe majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners, and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs. \nSignificant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nTo recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly observable and requires the Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically.\nTaxes on Earnings\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.\n45\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.\nOur effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax, or cash management reasons.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 80 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our Provision for taxes, Net earnings and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. \nAs of October 31, 2024, our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, with the exception of Server, which contains two reporting units:  Compute and High Performance Computing & AI (“HPC & AI”), and  Corporate Investments and Other which contains two reporting units: Advisory and Professional Services, and legacy Communications and Media Solutions. \nWhen performing the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived mostly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted cash flow analysis of management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, expected operating margins, and timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions and customer acceptances. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\n46\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Review\nOur annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 8% to 198% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, except for HPC & AI and Hybrid Cloud.\nThe HPC & AI reporting unit has goodwill of $2.0 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value over carrying value of 11% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business is growing at a very fast pace driven primarily by the AI demand from model builders, but as GPUs represent a large portion of the solutions, the pricing is very competitive and margins are limited. With the growth of AI in enterprise and sovereign customer segments and key strategic differentiators, such as direct liquid cooling, we believe that there is a potential for continued growth over time.\nInterim Goodwill Impairment Reviews\nIn September 2024, HPE sold 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C to UNIS. The equity investment in H3C primarily benefits the Compute and Hybrid Cloud reporting units. Subsequent to the sale, on September 30, 2024, we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis for Compute and Hybrid Cloud reporting units. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for these reporting units was 6% for Compute and 5% for Hybrid Cloud. We also applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of Compute and Hybrid Cloud, noting that neither had an excess of fair value over carrying amount.\nThe Compute reporting unit has goodwill of $8.2 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value over carrying value of 6% as of the September 30, 2024 interim test date. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. Over the last several years, digital transformation drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, in the current macroeconomic and inflationary environment, customers have invested selectively resulting in moderate unit growth and competitive pricing. The Compute business continues to focus on capturing market share while maintaining operating margin, leveraging its strong portfolio of ProLiant Gen11 products.\nThe Hybrid Cloud reporting unit has goodwill of $4.8 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value over carrying value of 5% as of the September 30, 2024 interim test date. Although the Hybrid Cloud business is on a positive trajectory, we are managing both a sales model transition and product transition within this business. Our product model transition is to a more cloud-native, software-defined platform with HPE Alletra. Translating this growth to revenue and operating income will take time because a greater mix of high margin business such as ratable software and services, is deferred and recognized in future periods.\nOur interim 2024 goodwill impairment test performed as of November 1, 2023 based on organizational changes impacting the composition of reporting units as of that date did not result in any impairment charges. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) the prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\n47\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nResults of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\n \nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDollars\n% of Revenue\nDollars\n% of Revenue\nDollars\n% of Revenue\n \nDollars in millions\nNet revenue\n$\n30,127 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n29,135 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n28,496 \n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization shown separately below)\n20,249 \n67.2 \n%\n18,896 \n64.9 \n%\n18,990 \n66.6 \n%\nGross profit\n9,878 \n32.8 \n%\n10,239 \n35.1 \n%\n9,506 \n33.4 \n%\nResearch and development\n2,246 \n7.5 \n%\n2,349 \n8.1 \n%\n2,045 \n7.2 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n4,871 \n16.2 \n%\n5,160 \n17.7 \n%\n4,941 \n17.3 \n%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n267 \n0.9 \n%\n288 \n1.0 \n%\n293 \n1.0 \n%\nImpairment of goodwill\n— \n— \n%\n— \n— \n%\n905 \n3.2 \n%\nTransformation costs\n93 \n0.3 \n%\n283 \n1.0 \n%\n473 \n1.7 \n%\nDisaster charges\n7 \n— \n%\n1 \n— \n%\n48 \n0.2 \n%\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges\n204 \n0.6 \n%\n69 \n0.1 \n%\n19 \n0.1 \n%\n Earnings from operations\n2,190 \n7.3 \n%\n2,089 \n7.2 \n%\n782 \n2.7 \n%\nInterest and other, net\n(117)\n(0.4)\n%\n(104)\n(0.3)\n%\n(121)\n(0.4)\n%\nGain on sale of equity interest\n733 \n2.4 \n%\n— \n0.1 \n%\n— \n— \n%\nEarnings from equity interests\n147 \n0.5 \n%\n245 \n0.8 \n%\n215 \n0.8 \n%\n Earnings before provision for taxes\n2,953 \n9.8 \n%\n2,230 \n7.8 \n%\n876 \n3.1 \n%\nProvision for taxes\n(374)\n(1.2)\n%\n(205)\n(0.7)\n%\n(8)\n(0.1)\n%\nNet earnings attributable to HPE\n2,579 \n8.6 \n%\n2,025 \n7.0 \n%\n868 \n3.0 \n%\nPreferred stock dividends\n(25)\n(0.1)\n%\n— \n— \n%\n— \n— \n%\nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders\n$\n2,554 \n8.5 \n%\n$\n2,025 \n7.0 \n%\n$\n868 \n3.0 \n%\nFiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023\nNet revenue\nIn fiscal 2024, total net revenue of $30.1 billion represented an increase of $992 million, or 3.4% (increased 3.3% on a constant currency basis).

The decrease was primarily due to decline in revenue in the Intelligent Edge segment and higher mix of lower margin products in the Server segment.\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\nR&D expense decreased by $103 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to capitalization of software costs, which contributed 4.2 percentage points to the change.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)\nSG&A expense decreased by $289 million, or 5.6%, primarily due to lower employee costs, which contributed 3.3 percentage points, lower travel and marketing expenses and lower consulting costs, both of which contributed 1.4 percentage points to the change. \nTransformation programs and costs \nOur transformation programs consist of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan (launched in 2020) and the HPE Next Plan (launched in 2017).  \nTransformation costs \ndecreased by $190 million, or 67.1%, due to lower charges incurred in the current period as the primary elements of these plans have been substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 3, “Transformation Programs” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II for further discussion.\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges increased by $135 million or 195.7%, primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks.\n49\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nInterest and other, net\nInterest and other, net expense increased by $13 million or 12.5%, primarily due to lower gain from sale of certain investments and unfavorable currency fluctuations in the current year and the previous year containing tax indemnification income due to an audit settlement. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in net interest expense and lower loss on equity investments in the current year. \nGain on sale of equity interest\nOn September 4, 2024, the Company divested 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C to UNIS. We continue to possess the option to sell the remaining 19% of the total issued share capital of H3C at a later date. In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain on sale of equity interest of $733 million.\nEarnings from equity interests\nIn fiscal 2024, Earnings from equity interests decreased by $98 million or 40%, primarily due to lower net income earned by H3C and the disposition of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C, partially offset by lower amortization expense from basis difference in the current period.\nProvision for taxes \nFor fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $374 million and $205 million, respectively, which reflect effective tax rates of 12.7% and 9.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore. \nIn fiscal 2024, we recorded $43 million of net income tax charges related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n•\n$104 million of net income tax charges resulting from the gain on the H3C divestiture, which includes $215 million of U.S. and foreign income tax charges offset by $111 million of income tax benefit for the release of an uncertain tax benefit related to the prior divestiture, partially offset by\n•\n$54 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges and\n•\n$11 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nIn fiscal 2023, we recorded $131 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n•\n$104 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges and\n•\n$19 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nSegment Information\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the CEO, uses to evaluate, view, and run our business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results.\nA description of the products and services for each segment, along with other pertinent information related to Segments can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\n50\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nSegment Results\nThe following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023:\nHPE\nConsolidated\nServer\nHybrid Cloud\nIntelligent Edge\nFinancial Services\nCorporate\nInvestments and Other\nDollars in millions, except for per share amounts\nNet revenue\n(1)\n$\n30,127\n$\n16,205\n$\n5,386\n$\n4,532\n$\n3,512\n$\n1,014\nYear-over-year change %\n3.4%\n12.8%\n(1.9)%\n(15.7)%\n0.9%\n2.9%\nEarnings (loss) from operations\n(2)\n$\n2,190\n$\n1,818\n$\n245\n$\n1,115\n$\n316\n$\n(25)\nEarnings (loss) from operations as a % of net revenue\n7.3%\n11.2%\n4.5%\n24.6%\n9.0%\n(2.5)%\nYear-over-year change percentage points\n0.1 \npts\n(1.5)\npts\n0.3 \npts\n(0.4)\npts\n0.9 \npts\n5.3 \npts\n(1)\nHPE consolidated net revenue excludes inter-segment net revenue. \n(2)\nSegment earnings from operations exclude certain unallocated corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges, divestiture related exit costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\nServer\n \nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n% Change\n2023 vs 2022  % Change\n \nDollars in millions\nNet revenue\n$\n16,205 \n$\n14,361 \n$\n15,472 \n12.8 \n%\n(7.2)\n%\nEarnings from operations\n$\n1,818 \n$\n1,830 \n$\n1,958 \n(0.7)\n%\n(6.5)\n%\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue\n11.2 \n%\n12.7 \n%\n12.7 \n%\nFiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023\nServer net revenue increased by $1,844 million, or 12.8% in actual dollars and constant currency, primarily due to a $1,812 million, or 16.7%, increase in product revenue. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to higher AUPs of $1,769 million, or 16.3%.\nServer earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.5 percentage points primarily due to an increase in costs of products as a percentage of net revenue, moderated by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in costs of products as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher mix of lower margin products and competitive pricing pressure. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to lower total operating expenses as a result of cost containment measures.\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal \n2022\nServer net revenue decreased by $1,111 million, or 7.2% (decreased 3.5% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to a $1,061 million, or 8.9%, decrease in product revenue. The decline in product revenue was primarily due to lower server unit volume of $1,281 million, or 10.7%, and unfavorable currency fluctuations of $458 million, or 3.8%. The product revenue decline was moderated by an increase in AUPs of $683 million, or 5.7%, led by higher sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures in our next generation products.\nServer earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat.\n51\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nHybrid Cloud\n \nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023 \n% Change\n2023 vs 2022 \n% Change\n \nDollars in millions\nNet revenue\n$\n5,386 \n$\n5,493 \n$\n5,233 \n(1.9)\n%\n5.0 \n%\nEarnings from operations\n$\n245 \n$\n232 \n$\n468 \n5.6 \n%\n(50.4)\n%\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue\n4.5 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n8.9 \n%\nFiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023\nHybrid Cloud net revenue decreased \nby $107 million, or 1.9%\n (decreased 2.0% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to a decrease in AUPs, partially offset by an increase in unit volume.

Hybrid Cloud services revenue increased by $160 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to a unit volume increase of $275 million, or 12.5%, led by private cloud and infrastructure SaaS. This increase was partially offset by lower AUPs of $107 million, or 4.9%.\nHybrid Cloud earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat as compared to the prior-year period.\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nHybrid Cloud net revenue increased by $260 million, or 5.0% (increased 8.2% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to an increase in unit volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations and decrease in AUPs. Hybrid Cloud product revenue increased by $180 million, or 5.8%, primarily due to an increase in unit volume of $371 million or 11.9%, led by private cloud and infrastructure SaaS. The increase in product revenue was moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations of $130 million or 4.2%, and a decrease in AUPs of $39 million or 1.3%. Hybrid Cloud services revenue increased by $80 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to a unit volume increase of $178 million, or 8.4%, led by private cloud and infrastructure SaaS. The increase in service revenue was partially offset by decrease in AUPs of $43 million or 2.0% and unfavorable currency fluctuations of $40 million or 1.9%.\nHybrid Cloud earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 4.7 percentage points due to an increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to lower margin GreenLake Flex Solutions deals and decrease in storage subscription revenue. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nIntelligent Edge\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023 \n% Change\n2023 vs 2022 \n% Change\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue\n$\n4,532 \n$\n5,379 \n$\n3,857 \n(15.7)\n%\n39.5 \n%\nEarnings from operations\n$\n1,115 \n$\n1,343 \n$\n542 \n(17.0)\n%\n147.8 \n%\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue\n24.6 \n%\n25.0 \n%\n14.1 \n%\n52\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023\nIntelligent Edge net revenue decreased by $847 million, or 15.7% (decreased 15.9% on a constant currency basis). Product revenue decreased by $1,050 million, or 23.9%, led by lower volume and product mix effect of $876 million, or 19.9%, and lower AUPs of $183 million, or 4.2%. The product revenue decrease was led by switching products and wireless local area network products due to softened demand. Services net revenue increased $203 million, or 20.6%, primarily led by our aaS and attached support service offerings.\nIntelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.4 percentage points primarily due to increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by a decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased primarily due to scale of net revenue decline, higher employee costs related to acquisitions and investments to enhance Aruba offerings in GreenLake. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to favorable revenue mix and cost containment measures. \nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nIntelligent Edge net revenue increased by $1,522 million, or 39.5% (increased 42.5% on a constant currency basis). Product revenue increased by $1,396 million, or 46.5%, led by higher AUPs of $1,284 million, or 42.8%, and a volume and product mix effect of $217 million, or 7.2%, moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations of $106 million, or 3.5%. The product revenue increase was led by switching and wireless local area network products, which benefited from improvements in the supply availability, and elevated order book levels at the beginning of the period. Services net revenue increased $127 million, or 14.8%, primarily led by our aaS and attached support service offerings. \nIntelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 10.9 percentage points primarily due to decreases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to lower supply chain costs, moderating the decrease was a lower mix of higher-margin support services revenue.

The increase to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from a combination of higher borrowing costs and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.\nFinancing Volume\n \nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nIn millions\nFinancing volume\n$\n6,616 \n$\n6,412 \n$\n6,252 \nFinancing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 3.2% in fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher financing of HPE product sales and services, partially offset by lower financing of third-party product sales and services.\nPortfolio Assets and Ratios\nThe FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:\n \nAs of October 31\n \n2024\n2023\n \nDollars in millions\nFinancing receivables, gross\n$\n9,647 \n$\n8,814 \nNet equipment under operating leases\n3,632 \n4,100 \nCapitalized profit on intercompany equipment transactions\n(1)\n396 \n263 \nIntercompany leases\n(1)\n119 \n109 \nGross portfolio assets\n13,794 \n13,286 \nAllowance for doubtful accounts\n(2)\n177 \n178 \nOperating lease equipment reserve\n30 \n36 \nTotal reserves\n207 \n214 \nNet portfolio assets\n$\n13,587 \n$\n13,072 \nReserve coverage\n1.5 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nDebt-to-equity ratio\n(3)\n7.0x\n7.0x\n(1)\nIntercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation.\n(2)\nAllowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions.\n(3)\nDebt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.8 billion and $11.6 billion at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at October 31, 2024 and 2023, was $1.7 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2024 and 2023, FS net cash and cash equivalents balances were $533 million and $700 million, respectively.\nNet portfolio assets as of October 31, 2024 increased 3.9% from October 31, 2023. The increase generally resulted from new financing volume exceeding portfolio runoff during the period, along with favorable currency fluctuations. \n54\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, direct-financing and operating leases.

Cost of services as a percentage of net revenue increased primarily due to the scale of net revenue decline and increases in cost of services due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and higher expenses. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Overview \nWe use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product development initiatives, acquisitions and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to any future investments, share repurchases, and shareholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions. We anticipate that the funds made available, including the debt funding related to the pending merger with Juniper Networks, proceeds from issuance of the Preferred Stock and proceeds from the sale of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C, and cash generated from our operations, along with our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months (including for the payment of consideration to consummate the Juniper Networks transaction) and for the foreseeable future thereafter.  Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A.\nOur cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held in the U.S. as of October 31, 2024. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed.\nAmounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of amounts held outside the U.S. generally will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or \n55\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nforeign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn connection with the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, during fiscal 2024, we repurchased and settled an aggregate amount of $150 million. As of October 31, 2024, we had a remaining authorization of approximately $0.8 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on our share repurchase program, refer to Note 15, “Stockholders' Equity,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nOn May 23, 2024, we announced plans to divest our Communications Technology Group (“CTG”) business to HCLTech. CTG is included in our Communications and Media Solutions business, which is reported in the Corporate Investments and Other segment. This divestiture includes the platform-based software solutions portions of the CTG portfolio, including systems integration, network applications, data intelligence, and the business support systems groups. As of October 31, 2024, assets and liabilities to be sold have been presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale. On December 1, 2024, we completed the disposition of CTG. We received net proceeds of $210 million and expect to recognize a gain of approximately $230 million.\nOn January 9, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement, under which HPE will acquire Juniper Networks in an all-cash transaction for $40.00 per share, representing an equity value of approximately $14 billion. The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. On April 2, 2024, Juniper Networks shareholders approved the transaction. The closing of the transaction remains subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. In connection with the merger, we entered into a commitment letter whereby we obtained a commitment from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for a $14.0 billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, comprised of an $11.0 billion 364-day tranche and a $3.0 billion three-year tranche, subject to customary conditions (the “Term Loan Commitment Letter”). In September 2024, we issued $9.0 billion of senior unsecured notes and $1.5 billion of Preferred Stock, the net proceeds of which we intend to use to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Juniper Networks and for other general corporate purposes, which may include, among other uses, repaying certain indebtedness of HPE, Juniper Networks and our and its respective subsidiaries. In addition, in furtherance of the Term Loan Commitment Letter, we entered into term loan agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, Citibank, N.A., and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for approximately $12.0 billion of senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facilities, comprised of an approximately $9.0 billion 364-day tranche (which was reduced from the original commitment of $11.0 billion, upon receipt and application of approximately $2.0 billion in post-tax proceeds from our sale to UNIS of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C, as further described below) and a $3.0 billion three-year tranche, subject to customary conditions. We have since further reduced the commitments under the 364-day term loan to $1.0 billion upon receipt and application of certain proceeds from the aforementioned issuance of senior unsecured notes and the Preferred Stock. Unless previously terminated, commitments under both the 364-day term loan and the three-year term loan will terminate upon the earliest of (i) five business days after the Juniper Outside Date (as defined in such term loan agreements), (ii) the occurrence of the closing of the acquisition of Juniper Networks without the funding of any borrowings under either of the term loan agreements, and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement by HPE in writing in accordance with its terms. In connection with the entry into the aforementioned 364-day term loan and the three-year term loan, on September 12, 2024, we terminated the Term Loan Commitment Letter.\nIn September 2024, we issued 30 million shares of the Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, less issuance costs of $38 million. As of October 31, 2024, 30 million shares of the Preferred Stock was outstanding. We intend to use these net proceeds as indicated above. For more information on our Preferred Stock, refer to Note 15, “Stockholders' Equity,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nPursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among our relevant subsidiaries, UNIS, and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and most recently on October 28, 2022, we delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise our right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by us, which represent 49% of the total issued share capital of H3C. On May 26, 2023, our relevant subsidiaries entered into a Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held by us, through our subsidiaries. On May 24, 2024, our relevant subsidiaries entered into (i) an Amended and Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby our relevant subsidiaries shall sell to UNIS 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C for pre-tax cash consideration of approximately $2.1 billion by August 31, 2024 (the “Sale Transaction”), and (ii) an Agreement on Subsequent Arrangements with UNIS, whereby upon closing of the Sale Transaction, our relevant subsidiary shall have a put option to sell to UNIS and \n56\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nUNIS shall have a call option to purchase from our relevant subsidiary 19% of the total issued share capital of H3C for pre-tax cash consideration of approximately $1.4 billion between the 16\nth\n month and until the 36\nth\n month after the Sale Transaction. The transactions referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) above, taken together, revise the arrangements governing the aforementioned sale of all of the H3C shares held by us, through our subsidiaries and are subject to certain grace periods and regulatory approvals. On September 4, 2024, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, we received $2.1 billion of pre-tax consideration ($2.0 billion post-tax), in connection with the sale to UNIS of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C.\nLiquidity\nOur cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, total debt and available borrowing resources were as follows:\n \nAs of October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nIn millions\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n15,105 \n$\n4,581 \n$\n4,763 \nTotal debt\n18,246 \n12,355 \n12,465 \nAvailable borrowing resources\n(1)\n6,009 \n6,588 \n6,161 \nCommercial paper programs\n(2)\n5,101 \n5,071 \n5,208 \nUncommitted lines of credit\n(3)\n$\n908 \n$\n1,517 \n$\n953 \n    \n(1)\nExcludes the financing commitment for the Juniper Networks acquisition.

The decrease was moderated by favorable working capital, as compared to the prior-year period.\n57\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOur working capital metrics and cash conversion impacts were as follows:\n \nAs of October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDays of sales outstanding in accounts receivable (“DSO”)\n38 \n43 \n47 \nDays of supply in inventory (“DOS”)\n120 \n87 \n88 \nDays of purchases outstanding in accounts payable (“DPO”)\n(170)\n(134)\n(149)\nCash conversion cycle\n(12)\n(4)\n(14)\nThe cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of the revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity. \nDSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. Compared to the corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2023, the decrease in DSO by 5 days in the current period was primarily due to higher early collections.\nDOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2023, the increase in DOS by 33 days in the current period was primarily due to higher inventory levels caused by strategic purchases of key components to support growth in AI systems.\nDPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2023, the increase in DPO by 36 days in the current period was primarily due to higher inventory purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $3.2 billion in fiscal 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily due to proceeds from UNIS in connection with the sale of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C of $2.1 billion, lower net payments made in connection with business acquisitions of $0.6 billion, lower cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of $0.2 billion, and lower investments in property, plant and equipment and software assets, net of sales proceeds of $0.2 billion, as compared to the prior-year period.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $7.6 billion in fiscal 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to higher proceeds from debt issuance (net of issuance costs) of $6.5 billion, proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock (net of issuance costs) of $1.5 billion, and lower share repurchases of $0.3 billion, partially offset by higher repayments of debt of $0.6 billion, as compared to the prior-year period.\n58\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (“FCF”) represents cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) and software assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF increased by $0.1 billion, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to lower net capital expenditures, as compared to the prior-year period. For more information on our FCF, refer to the section entitled “GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations” included in this MD&A.\nFor more information on the impact of operating assets and liabilities to our cash flows, see Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. \nCapital Resources\nDebt Levels\n \nAs of October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nDollars in millions\nShort-term debt\n$\n4,742 \n$\n4,868 \n$\n4,612 \nLong-term debt\n$\n13,504 \n$\n7,487 \n$\n7,853 \nWeighted-average interest rate\n5.4 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nWe maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of several factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure. We maintain a revolving credit facility and two commercial paper programs, “the Parent Programs”, and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. In September 2024, we terminated the prior senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was entered into in December 2021, and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate lending commitment of $5.25 billion for a period of five years. The commitment is comprised of (i) $4.75 billion of commitments available immediately and (ii) $500 million of commitments available from and subject to the closing of the Juniper Networks acquisition and refinancing of Juniper Networks’ credit agreement in connection with the closing of the Juniper Networks acquisition. There have been no changes to our commercial paper programs since October 31, 2023.\nAs noted above, we are also party to two senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facilities, comprised of a $1.0 billion 364-day tranche and a $3.0 billion three-year tranche, subject to customary conditions. Unless previously terminated, commitments under both the 364-day term loan and the three-year term loan will terminate upon the earliest of (i) five business days after the Juniper Outside Date (as defined in such term loan agreements), (ii) the occurrence of the closing of the acquisition of Juniper Networks without the funding of any borrowings under either of the term loan agreements, and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement by HPE in writing in accordance with its terms.\nIn December 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depository shares, purchase contracts, guarantees or units consisting of any of these securities.\nSignificant funding and liquidity activities for fiscal 2024 were as follows:\nDebt Issuances:\n•\nIn September 2024, we issued (i) $1.25 billion of 4.45% Senior Notes due September 25, 2026, (ii) $1.25 billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due September 25, 2027, (iii) $1.75 billion of 4.55% Senior Notes due October 15, 2029, (iv) $1.25 billion of 4.85% Senior Notes due October 15, 2031, (v) $2.0 billion of 5.00% Senior Notes due October 15, 2034, and (vi) $1.5 billion of 5.60% Senior Notes due October 15, 2054.\n•\nIn June 2024, we issued $818 million of asset-backed debt securities in six tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 5.593% and final maturity date of April 2032.\n•\nIn January 2024, we issued $796 million of asset-backed debt securities in six tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 5.476% and final maturity date of November 2031.\n59\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nDebt Repayments:\n•\nIn October 2024, we redeemed $400 million of 6.102% Senior Notes with an original maturity date of April 1, 2026, utilizing the par call option on the debt, with no redemption penalties.\n•\nIn October 2024, we repaid $1.6 billion of 5.90% Senior Notes on their original maturity date.\n•\nIn April 2024, we repaid $1.0 billion of 1.45% Senior Notes on their original maturity date.\n•\nDuring fiscal 2024, we repaid $1,691 million of the outstanding asset-backed debt securities. \nOur weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. \nFor more information on our available borrowing resources and the impact of operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” and Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. \nCash Requirements and Commitments \nLong-term debt and interest payments on debt\nAs of October 31, 2024, future principal payment obligations on our long-term debt including asset-backed debt securities totaled $17.6 billion of which $4.0 billion is due within one year. As of October 31, 2024, our finance lease obligations, including interest, was $42 million, of which $7 million is to be due within one year. For more information on our debt, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nAs of October 31, 2024, future interest payments relating to our long-term debt is estimated to be approximately $7.6 billion, of which $0.9 billion is expected to be due within one year. We use interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps as of October 31, 2024 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.\nOperating lease obligations \nWe enter into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and aviation. As of October 31, 2024, operating lease obligations, net of sublease rental income totaled $1.7 billion, of which $286 million is due within one year. For more information on our leases, see Note 8, “Accounting for Leases as a Lessee,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nUnconditional purchase obligations \nOur unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. As of October 31, 2024, unconditional purchase obligations totaled $1.3 billion, of which $556 million is due within one year. For more information on our unconditional purchase obligations, see Note 17, “Litigation, Contingencies, and Commitments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. \nRetirement Benefit Plan Funding\nIn fiscal 2024, we anticipate making contributions of $189 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is to fund pension plans to meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are not considered as contractual obligations because they do not represent contractual cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\n60\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRestructuring Plans\nAs of October 31, 2024, we expect future cash payments of approximately $185 million in connection with our approved restructuring plans, which includes $80 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2025 and $105 million expected to be paid thereafter. Payments for restructuring activities are not considered as contractual obligations, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, “Transformation Programs,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of October 31, 2024, we had approximately $186 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions that could result in a cash payment. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $2 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nWe have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods presented:\nReconciliation of GAAP gross profit and gross profit margin to non-GAAP gross profit and gross profit margin.\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\nDollars\n% of\nRevenue\nDollars\n% of\nRevenue\nIn millions\nGAAP net revenue\n$\n30,127 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n29,135 \n100.0 \n%\nGAAP cost of sales\n20,249 \n67.2 \n%\n18,896 \n64.9 \n%\nGAAP gross profit\n9,878 \n32.8 \n%\n10,239 \n35.1 \n%\nNon-GAAP adjustments\nStock-based compensation expense\n49 \n0.1 \n%\n47 \n0.2 \n%\nDisaster recovery\n(43)\n(0.1)\n%\n(13)\n— \n%\nDivestiture related exit costs\n9 \n— \n%\n— \n— \n%\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n9,893 \n32.8 \n%\n$\n10,273 \n35.3 \n%\n61\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings from operations and operating profit margin to non-GAAP earnings from operations and operating profit margin.\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\nDollars\n% of\nRevenue\nDollars\n% of\nRevenue\nIn millions\nGAAP earnings from operations\n$\n2,190 \n7.3 \n%\n$\n2,089 \n7.2 \n%\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangible assets\n267 \n0.9 \n%\n288 \n1.0 \n%\nTransformation costs\n93 \n0.3 \n%\n283 \n1.0 \n%\nDisaster recovery\n(51)\n(0.2)\n%\n(12)\n— \n%\nStock-based compensation expense\n430 \n1.4 \n%\n428 \n1.5 \n%\nDivestiture related exit costs\n35 \n0.1 \n%\n— \n— \n%\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges\n204 \n0.7 \n%\n69 \n0.2 \n%\nNon-GAAP earnings from operations\n$\n3,168 \n10.5 \n%\n$\n3,145 \n10.8 \n%\nReconciliation of GAAP net earnings and diluted net earnings per share to non-GAAP net earnings and diluted net earnings per share.\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\nDollars \nDiluted net earnings per share\nDollars \nDiluted net earnings per share\nDollars in millions\nGAAP net earnings attributable to HPE\n$\n2,579 \n$\n1.93 \n$\n2,025 \n$\n1.54 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangible assets\n267 \n0.20 \n288 \n0.22 \nTransformation costs\n93 \n0.07 \n283 \n0.22 \nDisaster recovery\n(51)\n(0.04)\n(12)\n(0.01)\nStock-based compensation expense\n430 \n0.32 \n428 \n0.33 \nDivestiture related exit costs\n35 \n0.03 \n— \n— \nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges\n204 \n0.16 \n69 \n0.05 \nGain on sale of equity interest\n(733)\n(0.55)\n— \n— \nAdjustments for equity interests\n(107)\n(0.08)\n18 \n0.01 \nLoss on equity investments, net\n13 \n0.01 \n40 \n0.03 \nAdjustments for taxes\n(95)\n(0.07)\n(255)\n(0.20)\nOther adjustments\n(1)\n20 \n0.01 \n(52)\n(0.04)\nNon-GAAP net earnings attributable to HPE\n(2)\n2,655 \n1.99 \n2,832 \n2.15 \nPreferred stock dividends\n(25)\n— \nNon-GAAP net earnings attributable to common stockholders\n$\n2,630 \n$\n2,832 \n(1)    Other adjustments includes non-service net periodic benefit cost and tax indemnification and other adjustments.\n(2)    For purposes of calculating Non-GAAP diluted net EPS, the preferred stock dividends are added back to the Non-GAAP net earnings attributable to common stockholders and the diluted weighted average share calculation assumes the preferred stock was converted at issuance or as of the beginning of the reporting period.\n62\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIn millions\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,341 \n$\n4,428 \n$\n4,593 \nInvestment in property, plant and equipment and software assets\n(2,367)\n(2,828)\n(3,122)\nProceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment\n370 \n602 \n602 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(47)\n36 \n(279)\nFree cash flow\n$\n2,297 \n$\n2,238 \n$\n1,794 \nUse of non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and FCF. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FCF is cash flow from operations.\nWe believe that providing the non-GAAP measures stated above, in addition to the related GAAP measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information provides investors with a supplemental view to understand our historical and prospective operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of our operating performance with the performance of other companies in the same industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.\nEconomic Substance of non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating our past and future performance, without the impact of foreign exchange rates, as more than half of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S. We believe that excluding the items mentioned below from the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental view to management and our investors of our consolidated financial performance and presents the financial results of the business without costs that we do not believe to be reflective of our ongoing operating results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting the use of such non-GAAP financial measures as analytic tools. See “Compensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for further information.\nNon-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense, and disaster charges. See below for the reasons management excludes each item:\n•\nStock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation expense.\n63\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\n•\nDisaster recoveries include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to the exit of the Company’s businesses in Russia and Belarus. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes disaster recoveries from these non-GAAP measures as the specific net recoveries are non-recurring charges and not indicative of the operational performance of our business.\n•\nDivestiture related exit costs include expenses associated with certain disposal activities. On May 23, 2024, HPE announced plans to divest the Company’s CTG business, which was completed on December 1, 2024. We consider this divestiture to be a discrete event. We exclude these costs as these expenses are non-recurring exit costs to eliminate stranded costs of this business. In addition, our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges.\nNon-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin consist of earnings from operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue excluding the items mentioned above and charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. In addition to the items previously explained above, management excludes these items for the following reasons:\n•\nWe incur charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and exclude these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are noncash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset amortization. Although this does not directly affect our cash position, the loss in value of intangible assets over time can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure. \n•\nTransformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform our IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real estate identified as part of the initiatives. We exclude these costs as they are discrete costs related to two specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017 and 2020, respectively, as multi-year programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure following material divestiture transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product portfolio in fiscal 2020. The primary elements of the HPE Next and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially completed by October 31, 2023. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from our non-GAAP financial measures as stated above is to provide a supplemental measure of our operating results that does not include material HPE Next Plan and Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as we do not believe such costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating cost structure. Further as our transformation costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have been materially declining since 2021 and we do not expect to incur material transformation costs related to these programs beyond fiscal 2024, we believe non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to management and investors for comparing operating performance across multiple periods.\n•\nWe incur costs related to our acquisition, disposition and other related charges. The charges are direct expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. For fiscal 2024, these charges were driven by costs associated with the pending merger with Juniper Networks and the acquisition of Morpheus Data, in addition to prior acquisitions of Axis, Athonet and OpsRamp. For fiscal 2023, these charges were driven by acquisitions of Axis, Zerto, OpsRamp and Athonet. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. We consider these acquisitions and divestitures to be discrete events. We exclude these costs as these expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of our acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges.\nNon-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges mentioned above, as well as other items such as adjustments for equity interests, gain or loss on equity investments, other adjustments, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. In addition to the items previously explained, management excludes these items for the following reasons:\n•\nDuring the six months ended April 30, 2024, we stopped reporting H3C earnings in our non-GAAP results due to the planned divestiture of the H3C investment. Per the terms of the original Put Share Purchase Agreement, we weren’t anticipating receiving dividends from this investment prospectively. However, on May 24, 2024, we entered into an \n64\nTable of Contents\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAmended and Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement and an Agreement on Subsequent Arrangements, both with UNIS, as described in Note 19 “Equity Interests” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which, taken together, revise the arrangements governing the aforementioned sale as previously set forth in the original Put Share Purchase Agreement. On September 4, 2024, we divested 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C, which resulted in a gain of $733 million and is included in the fiscal 2024 adjustment Gain on sale of equity interest. We continue to possess the option to sell the remaining 19% of the total issued share capital of H3C at a later date. For the second half of fiscal 2024, the adjustment for equity interests incorporated the completed divestment of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C. All periods presented include the amortization of the basis difference in our investment. For fiscal 2023, this adjustment also included our portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. We believe that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP financial measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance.\n•\nWe exclude gains and losses (including impairments) on our non-marketable equity investments because we do not believe they are reflective of normal continuing business operations. These adjustments are reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We believe eliminating these adjustments for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance.\n•\nWe utilize a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to our operating structure that can vary in size, frequency and timing. When projecting this long-term rate, we evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including our expected tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal 2024, we used a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 15%, which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. For fiscal 2023 we used a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. We believe that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.\nFCF is defined as cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in PP&E and software assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period. Our management and investors can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in our businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating our historical and prospective liquidity.\nCompensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non- GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies (limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes) and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets.\nWe compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this fiscal year and prior periods, and we encourage investors to review those reconciliations carefully.\n65\nTable of Contents",
