One of America's most recognized companies, Union Pacific Railroad Company connects 23 states in the western two-thirds of the country by rail, providing a critical link in the global supply chain. The Railroad’s diversified business mix includes Bulk, Industrial, and Premium. Union Pacific serves many of the fastest-growing U.S. population centers, operates from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to Eastern gateways, connects with Canada's rail systems, and is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Union Pacific provides value to its roughly 10,000 customers by delivering products in a safe, reliable, fuel-efficient, and environmentally responsible manner.\nUnion Pacific Corporation was incorporated in Utah in 1969 and maintains its principal executive offices at 1400 Douglas Street, Omaha, NE 68179. The telephone number at that address is (402) 544-5000. The common stock of Union Pacific Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “UNP”.\nFor purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to \"Union Pacific\", “UPC”, “Corporation”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” shall mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which we separately refer to as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.\nSTRATEGY\nSafety, Service, and Operational Excellence supports the Company's long-term initiative to Grow its freight volumes. Together as a team, the Company will focus on achieving the best safety record in the industry, being known for superior service, grounded in operational excellence, which, in turn, drives growth. \nSafety\n is paramount and, as our first area of focus, sets the foundation for achieving the Company's objectives. The mindset and culture are built around a personal commitment by all employees to prioritize safety so everyone goes home safely.\nService\n is all about delivering what we sold our customers. We work with our customers to understand the service they need to win in their markets and then drive how we win together. We commit to these service levels and do it with excellence.\nOperational Excellence\n is about operating efficiently and productively. We will drive value with our available resources but also maintain a buffer so our service is resilient, managing the inevitable ups and downs that come with weather, fluctuating volumes, and securing growth.\nGrowth\n is the outcome of executing our strategy to be the industry leader in both safety and service resulting in improved margins and greater cash generation, creating long term enterprise value. The expected outcome of successfully executing our strategy will be an industry leading operating ratio and return on invested capital.\nAs we work to transform our railroad, our core values continue to guide us. Our passion for performance will help us win; our high ethical standards ensure we win in a way that supports all of our stakeholders; and our teamwork ensures we win together.\nOPERATIONS\nThe Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although we provide and analyze revenues by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Additional information regarding our business and operations, including revenues, financial information and data, and other information regarding environmental matters, is presented in Risk Factors, Item 1A; Legal Proceedings, Item 3; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. \n5\nTable of \nContents\nOperations\n – UPRR is a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. We have 32,880 route miles, connecting Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican and Canadian gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers to move freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast, and East Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. In 2024, we generated freight revenues totaling $22.8 billion from the following three commodity groups:\n2024 Freight Revenues\nBulk\n – The Company's Bulk shipments consist of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. In 2024, this group generated 32% of our freight revenues. We access most major grain markets, connecting the Midwest and Western U.S. producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports as well as Mexico. We also serve significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders, ethanol, and renewable biofuel producers in the Midwest and West. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, Midwest, Western U.S., and Canada (through interline access) for delivery to major agricultural users in those areas as well as abroad. The Railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal shipments to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the U.S. Through interchange gateways and ports, UPRR’s reach extends to Eastern U.S. utilities as well as to Mexico and other international destinations. Coal traffic originating in the Powder River Basin (PRB) area of Wyoming is the largest portion of the Railroad’s coal business.\nIndustrial\n – Our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout North America. The Industrial group consists of several categories, including construction, industrial chemicals, plastics, forest products, specialized products (primarily waste, salt, and roofing), metals and ores, petroleum, liquid petroleum gases (LPG), soda ash, and sand. Transportation of these products accounted for 37% of our freight revenues in 2024. Commercial, residential, and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel, aggregates, cement, and wood products. Industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel, nonferrous materials, minerals, and other raw materials.\nThe industrial chemicals market consists of a vast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of more complex chemicals. Plastics shipments support automotive, housing, and the durable and disposable consumer goods markets. Forest product shipments include lumber and paper commodities. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest or Western Canada and move throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction and repairs and remodeling. Paper shipments primarily support packaging needs. Oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel, finished pipe, stone, and drilling fluid commodities. The Company’s petroleum and LPG shipments are primarily impacted by refinery utilization rates, regional crude pricing differentials, pipeline capacity, and the use of asphalt for road programs. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad.\nPremium\n – In 2024, Premium shipments generated 31% of Union Pacific’s total freight revenues. Premium includes finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. International business consists of import and export traffic moving in 20 or 40-foot shipping containers, that mainly pass through West Coast ports, destined for one of the Company's many inland intermodal terminals. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies) as well as truckload carriers.\nWe are the largest automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River and operate or access 39 vehicle distribution centers. The Railroad’s extensive franchise accesses six vehicle assembly plants and connects to West Coast ports, all six major Mexico gateways, and the Port of Houston to accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, the Company provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S., and Canada.\nSeasonality\n – Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity (such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons) and the demand cycle for the commodity (such as intermodal traffic that generally peaks during the third quarter to meet back-to-school and holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter). The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors, including the strength of domestic and \n6\nTable of \nContents\ninternational economies and currencies; consumer demand; the strength of harvests, which can be adversely affected by severe weather; market prices for agricultural products; and supply chain disruptions.\nProud & Engaged Workforce\n – Our employees are central to our strategy of Safety, Service, and Operational Excellence leading to Growth, and investing in our workforce is key to our success.\nOur People\n:\n Our award-winning, multigenerational workforce includes talented people from all walks of life, in many stages of life. Made up of management and craft professionals, we are focused on attracting, retaining, and developing talent across our entire system.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company employed 32,439 employees. Our workforce includes five generations from Traditionalists (born before 1946) to Generation Z (born after 1998). The average age is 46.9 with an average tenure of 16.2\n \nyears.\nUnion Pacific works with 13 major rail unions, representing approximately 84% of our workforce. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA), a federal statute enacted in 1926, our collective bargaining agreements are subject to modification every five years. Existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or until the RLA procedures are exhausted. The RLA is designed to bring the railroads and unions to agreement without disruptions to rail transportation. Local negotiations began on January 1, 2025, related to years 2025-2029. \nOur Culture:\n At Union Pacific, the How Matters – high ethical standards guide the decisions we make and action we take to protect our employees, communities, and customers. Our passion for performance drives our safety, customer experience, and financial results while we work as a team to create opportunity for all.\nSafety is central to everything we do at Union Pacific. Together, we are committed to cultivating a safety-focused culture, so our employees return home safely every day. To achieve this, our employees identify risks, initiate action to mitigate those risks, and have the courage to care to keep each other safe.\nOur success is measured by our personal injury rate (the number of reportable injuries for every 200,000 employee-hours worked) and our derailment incident rate (the number of reportable derailment incidents per million train miles). Reportable personal injuries are defined as on duty incidents or occupational illnesses that result in employees losing time away from work, modifying or restricting their normal duties, or receiving any medical treatment above and beyond first aid. Reportable derailment incidents are defined as any occurrence where a wheel of a locomotive or rail car falls off the track and causes damage to track, equipment, or structures above the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) reporting threshold, regardless of ownership \n($12,000 \nfor 2024 and \n$12,400\n for 2025) per million train miles. Personal injuries and derailment incidents that meet reportable criteria are reported to the FRA.\nOur 2024 personal injury rate of 0.90 improved 23%, and our derailment incident rate of 2.17 improved 20% versus 2023. (See further discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7, of this report.)\nUnion Pacific is committed to creating an environment where people can be their best, personally and professionally. We believe that a supportive culture increases employee engagement, improves morale, and allows qualified employees to succeed and contribute to Union Pacific's success. All of this supports our safety strategy and improves the quality of decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic thinking.\nUnion Pacific’s commitment, today and for the future, is to further improve and strengthen performance through our workforce, where everyone is treated fairly, differences are valued, and talent is recognized and rewarded. Union Pacific intends to maintain its standards of hiring and promoting based on merit, while aspiring to reach 40% people of color and double our female representation to 11% in our workforce by 2030. As of December 31, 2024, workforce representation of people of color and females was 34.3% and 5.2%, respectively.\nThe Employee Journey:\n From recruitment to retirement and milestones in between, we are relentlessly focused on supporting and engaging employees throughout their Union Pacific journey. We view it as imperative to invest in our employees with meaningful benefit offerings, developmental experiences, and career opportunities.\nThe process begins with recruitment, where we strive to attract the most talented employees to join our team. Then, we focus on training and development, which includes courses and programs designed to help our employees grow into new roles and/or learn a new skill in their current role so that we can retain our workforce over time.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nProviding competitive compensation and meaningful benefits is key to attracting and retaining talented employees. Union Pacific is committed to continuously reviewing its compensation programs and comprehensive benefits programs to promote programs that are fair and competitive. Both are key to enhancing the value of working for Union Pacific and demonstrating the Company’s commitment to the health and wealth of employees during their career. Benefits vary based on the applicable collective bargaining agreement or an employee’s management status. The final stage of the employee journey is a fulfilling retirement, which is enabled during their Union Pacific career through our compensation and benefit programs, particularly contributions to 401(k) plans and the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).\nOur Board of Directors evaluates our non-union compensation plans and reviews recommendations from the Compensation and Talent Committee, while collective bargaining agreements govern compensation for our union employees. The median annual compensation for all employees employed as of December 31, 2024, was $103,190 (excluding the CEO).\nTalent is critical - our ability to recruit and retain employees is directly tied to our railroad’s success, as proven by our strong retention rate, our robust offerings, benefits, and work environment that creates meaningful family-supporting careers. We are focused on effectively managing workforce levels to the demands of the business and improving quality of life for our employees.\nRailroad Security\n – Our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures, including employee training, engagement with our customers, training of emergency responders, and partnerships with numerous federal, state, and local government agencies. While federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents, the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives.\nUPRR Security Measures\n – We maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise. The plan includes four levels of alert status, each with its own set of countermeasures. We employ our own police force, consisting of commissioned and highly-trained officers. The police are certified state law enforcement officers with investigative and arrest powers. The Union Pacific Police Department has achieved accreditation under the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA) for complying with the highest law enforcement standards. Our employees undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federally mandated hazardous materials and security training. We regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs. We maintain the capability to move critical operations to back-up facilities in different locations.\nWe operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day. The center receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, law enforcement, and other government officials. In cooperation with government officials, we monitor both threats and public events, and, as necessary, we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations. We comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law. We design our operating plan to expedite the movement of Rail Security Sensitive Materials (RSSM), a subset of particularly hazardous materials, to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers. Additionally, in compliance with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) regulations, we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of RSSM with customers and interchange partners.\nWe established a number of our own innovative safety and security-oriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to The Officer on Train program, which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks. Our staff of information security professionals continually assess cybersecurity risks and implement mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. To date, we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or incident directed at us.\nCooperation with Federal, State, and Local Government Agencies\n – We work closely on physical and cybersecurity initiatives with government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT); the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the TSA; as well as local police departments, fire departments, and other first responders.\nIn compliance with TSA regulations established in 2022, we designated a Cybersecurity Coordinator to oversee our cybersecurity initiatives and report required incidents to the CISA. We communicated our Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan and conducted a Cybersecurity Vulnerability Assessment to identify potential risks. Our Cybersecurity Implementation Plan outlines the specific actions taken to meet the TSA prevention, detection, and response requirements. Additionally, an ongoing assessment program has been implemented to proactively and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program to identify and mitigate emerging risks. These efforts have been validated by the TSA, confirming our adherence to their standards.\n8\nTable of \nContents\nIn conjunction with the Association of American Railroads (AAR), we sponsor Ask Rail, a mobile application that provides first responders with secure links to electronic information, including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations. We also participate in the National Joint Terrorism Task Force, a multi-agency effort established by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to combat and prevent terrorism.\nWe work with the Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Military Transport Management Command, which monitor shipments entering the UPRR rail network at U.S. border crossings and ports. We were the first railroad in the U.S. to be named a partner in CBP’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, a partnership designed to develop, enhance, and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain.\nCooperation with Customers and Trade Association\ns – Through TransCAER (Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response), we work with the AAR, the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools, including the training of emergency responders. In cooperation with the FRA and other interested groups, we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials.\nSustainable Future\n – Union Pacific believes it is important that we act as environmental stewards, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and supporting the transition to a more sustainable future. While we work to further reduce our environmental footprint, it is important to note that railroads already are one of the most fuel-efficient means of transportation. Freight rail leads other forms of surface transportation when it comes to minimizing GHG emissions, and we expect rail will continue to play a critical role in mitigating and abating the impacts of climate change. According to the AAR, moving freight by rail instead of truck reduces GHG emissions by up to 75%. Therefore, converting freight transportation from truck to rail typically results in an immediate reduction in our customers' scope 3 GHG emissions.\nCompetition\n – see “\nWe Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers\n” in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\nKey Suppliers\n – see “\nWe Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail\n” in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\nAvailable Information\n – Our Internet website is www.up.com.

Therefore, such information should not be considered part of this report.\nGOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION\nGovernmental Regulation\n – Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, generally applicable to all businesses. (See also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3.)\nThe operations of the Railroad are subject to the regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies as well as the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; common carrier service of regulated traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension, or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The STB is reviewing proposed rulemaking in various areas, including reciprocal switching and commodity exemptions, and has finalized rules creating new procedures for smaller rate complaints that are being reviewed in appellate courts. The STB also continues to explore changes to the methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy, the possible uses of revenue adequacy in regulating railroad rates, \n9\nTable of \nContents\nand ways to regulate service, including by use of emergency service orders. The STB posts quarterly reports on rate reasonableness cases, maintains a database on service complaints, and has the authority to initiate investigations, among other things.\nThe DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the DHS, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.\nEnvironmental Regulation\n – We are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies, such as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), among others. The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating wastewater discharges.\nInformation concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Environmental, Item 7, and Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.",

The following section generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although we provide and analyze revenues by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n2024 Results\n•\nSafety\n – 2024 was a transformational year on our journey to becoming the safest railroad. Our strategy is broken into four pillars – Injury Prevention, Leverage Technology, Situational Awareness Testing, and Peer-to-Peer Engagement.\nInjury Prevention efforts focus on specific, critical tasks to reduce the risk of injury or derailment. These critical tasks are those where any form of non-compliance can result in a serious injury. Training is key to helping our employees understand how to execute those tasks safely.\nWe are Leveraging Technology to eliminate or automate activities with the most risk. We have more than 7,000 wayside detectors that monitor freight cars and locomotives in real time, generating 16 million data points daily to proactively identify and mitigate risks. We are building safer trains with our proprietary Physics Train Builder technology, which allows us to evaluate train and route characteristics to enable proactive intervention by our Operating Practices Command Center to prevent derailments. We utilize our autonomous geometry car fleet to inspect 500,000 miles of track annually. This technology and the data it provides enable us to direct investments and resources in the right place, helping to significantly reduce track-caused derailments over the last 10 years.\nSituational Awareness Testing (a program we call COMMIT) is our program that observes, tests, and coaches our employees to promote understanding and compliance with our work rules. This goes beyond the classroom, with an emphasis on being in the field with the employees as they are performing the activities that run the railroad.\nPeer-to-Peer Engagement is driving employee ownership through engagement with our safety programs. This is our culture, a personal commitment to do our jobs with a passion for safety so everyone goes home safely. Employees are encouraged to speak up if they see unsafe behaviors.\n23\nTable of \nContents\nThe focus on these four pillars is driving results. Our personal injury rate (the number of reportable injuries for every 200,000 employee-hours worked) is down 23% and our derailment incident rate (the number of reportable derailment incidents per million train miles) down 20% compared to 2023 results.\n•\nService\n – Service performance index for both intermodal and manifest products improved 2 and 4 points, respectively, compared to 2023. Throughout the year we improved network fluidity as reflected in 2% faster freight car velocity and record terminal dwell, improved 3% from 2023.\n•\nOperational Excellence\n – Network performance throughout 2024 was strong. While we experienced some powerful weather events in the second quarter and a second half surge in international intermodal shipments, most of our operating metrics improved year-over year. We maintained a resource buffer that allowed us to strategically integrate crews, locomotives, and freight cars into the network to efficiently handle the growth and recover from the weather events.\n•\nFinancial Results\n – Core pricing gains, strong productivity, and 3% volume growth positively impacted our financial results. Operating income of $9.7 billion increased 7% from 2023, and our operating ratio was 59.9%, improving 2.4 points from 2023. Net income of $6.7 billion translated into earnings of $11.09 per diluted share, up 6% from 2023.\nWe generated $9.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities, yielded free cash flow of $2.8 billion after reductions of $3.3 billion for cash used in investing activities and $3.2 billion in dividends paid. Both cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were higher by $384 million due to payments in 2023 related to back wages for agreements reached with our labor unions. \nFree cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):\nMillions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n9,346\n \n$\n8,379 \n$\n9,362 \nCash used in investing activities\n(3,325)\n(3,667)\n(3,471)\nDividends paid\n(3,213)\n(3,173)\n(3,159)\nFree cash flow\n$\n2,808\n \n$\n1,539 \n$\n2,732 \n2025 Outlook\n•\nSafety\n – Our goal is to be an industry leader in safety, and we are committed to continuously finding new ways to enhance safety. In 2025, we will continue to focus on our four pillars of safety. Training that engages both new and experienced employees is fundamental to our success. Critical safety tasks will be reinforced and enhanced by adding critical-thinking scenarios to the classroom curriculum. We will continue using a comprehensive safety management approach utilizing technology, hazard identification and risk assessments, employee engagement, training, quality control, and targeted capital investments. In addition, we will continue to collect and utilize data with the goal of identifying and mitigating exposure to risk, detect rail defects, improve or close grade crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs, and local community activities across the network. Safety is paramount to the success of the railroad and deeply ingrained in our culture, and this will not change in 2025.\n•\nService\n – We are committed to delivering the service we sold to our customers. As we meet with customers to agree on their specific needs and outcomes, we will continue to measure ourselves against the best service we provided them over the last three years and use that as a guide for meeting their expectations. We will engage with customers by being the first to act on new opportunities, investing to grow, and finding innovative solutions to win together.\n•\nOperational Excellence\n – To provide our customers with the service we sold, we must run a fluid network. Network fluidity enables us to effectively utilize all our resources and provides the capacity to respond in an ever-changing environment. Terminal dwell and freight car velocity are key indicators of that fluidity. We will continue to transform our railroad using technology and automation to further improve our service product, improve resource utilization, and lower our overall cost structure.\n24\nTable of \nContents\n•\nBusiness Volumes\n – Macroeconomic uncertainties remain in 2025 that could have a material impact on our 2025 financial and operating results. Current forecasts for 2025 industrial production show a slight increase versus 2024. In addition, other factors, such as imposition of higher tariffs and changes in domestic and foreign monetary policy may affect economic activity and demand for rail transportation; natural gas prices, weather conditions, and demand for other energy sources may impact the coal market; crude oil prices and spreads may drive demand for petroleum products and drilling materials; available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business; and international trade agreements could promote or hinder trade. Lower coal demand, resulting from ongoing competitive energy dynamics and reduced coal-fired electricity production, and lower international intermodal business, due to the west coast volume surge in 2024, are expected to negatively impact volumes. Additionally, the way our customers are affected by and respond to the implementation of new tariffs may influence our volume levels and traffic flows. Fuel prices may continue to fluctuate in the current economic environment. As prices fluctuate, there will be a timing impact on earnings, as our fuel surcharge programs trail increases or decreases in fuel prices by approximately two months. Regardless of external factors, we will focus on operating a safe railroad and delivering the service we sold to our customers as well as effective asset utilization, cost control, and seeking new business opportunities.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating Revenues\nMillions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% Change 2024 v 2023\n% Change 2023 v 2022\nFreight revenues\n$\n22,811\n \n$\n22,571 \n$\n23,159 \n1\n \n%\n(3)\n%\nOther subsidiary revenues\n788\n \n872 \n884 \n(10)\n(1)\nAccessorial revenues\n554\n \n584 \n779 \n(5)\n(25)\nOther\n97\n \n92 \n53 \n5\n \n74 \nTotal\n$\n24,250\n \n$\n24,119 \n$\n24,875 \n1\n \n%\n(3)\n%\nWe generate freight revenues by transporting products from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues vary with volumes (carloads) and average revenue per car (ARC). Changes in price, traffic mix, and fuel surcharges drive ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available historical, current, and forecasted volumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.\nOther subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\nFreight revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $22.8 billion driven by a 3% increase in volumes and core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix of traffic (for example, a relative increase in international intermodal shipments, which have a lower ARC). Volume increases were primarily driven by international intermodal and grain and grain product shipments, partially offset by weaker demand for coal and rock shipments.\nOur fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenues in 2024 decreased $0.4 billion due to a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lag impact of fluctuating fuel prices (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries), partially offset by higher volumes.\nIn 2024, other subsidiary revenues decreased compared to 2023 primarily driven by a weaker demand for intermodal shipments at our subsidiary that brokers intermodal and transload logistics services and the partial transfer of our commuter operations to Metra. Accessorial revenues decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by lower intermodal accessorial revenues because of our intermodal equipment sale, partially offset by a one-time contract settlement.\n25\nTable of \nContents\nThe following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and ARC by commodity type:\nFreight Revenues\nMillions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% Change 2024 v 2023\n% Change 2023 v 2022\nGrain & grain products\n$\n3,828\n \n$\n3,644 \n$\n3,598 \n5\n \n%\n1 \n%\nFertilizer\n811\n \n757 \n712 \n7\n \n6 \nFood & refrigerated\n1,085\n \n1,041 \n1,093 \n4\n \n(5)\nCoal & renewables\n1,483\n \n1,916 \n2,134 \n(23)\n(10)\nBulk\n7,207\n \n7,358 \n7,537 \n(2)\n(2)\nIndustrial chemicals & plastics\n2,345\n \n2,176 \n2,158 \n8\n \n1 \nMetals & minerals\n2,081\n \n2,194 \n2,196 \n(5)\n- \nForest products\n1,326\n \n1,347 \n1,465 \n(2)\n(8)\nEnergy & specialized markets\n2,688\n \n2,521 \n2,386 \n7\n \n6 \nIndustrial\n8,440\n \n8,238 \n8,205 \n2\n \n- \nAutomotive\n2,452\n \n2,421 \n2,257 \n1\n \n7 \nIntermodal\n4,712\n \n4,554 \n5,160 \n3\n \n(12)\nPremium\n7,164\n \n6,975 \n7,417 \n3\n \n(6)\nTotal\n$\n22,811\n \n$\n22,571 \n$\n23,159 \n1\n \n%\n(3)\n%\nRevenue Carloads\nThousands\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% Change 2024 v 2023\n% Change 2023 v 2022\nGrain & grain products\n850\n \n798 \n798 \n7\n \n%\n- \n%\nFertilizer\n213\n \n191 \n190 \n12\n \n1 \nFood & refrigerated\n177\n \n175 \n187 \n1\n \n(6)\nCoal & renewables\n702\n \n867 \n885 \n(19)\n(2)\nBulk\n1,942\n \n2,031 \n2,060 \n(4)\n(1)\nIndustrial chemicals & plastics\n672\n \n645 \n637 \n4\n \n1 \nMetals & minerals\n719\n \n793 \n785 \n(9)\n1 \nForest products\n213\n \n213 \n241 \n-\n \n(12)\nEnergy & specialized markets\n607\n \n582 \n552 \n4\n \n5 \nIndustrial\n2,211\n \n2,233 \n2,215 \n(1)\n1 \nAutomotive\n824\n \n820 \n778 \n-\n \n5 \nIntermodal [a]\n3,357\n \n3,028 \n3,116 \n11\n \n(3)\nPremium\n4,181\n \n3,848 \n3,894 \n9\n \n(1)\nTotal\n8,334\n \n8,112 \n8,169 \n3\n \n%\n(1)\n%\nAverage Revenue per Car\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% Change 2024 v 2023\n% Change 2023 v 2022\nGrain & grain products\n$\n4,505\n \n$\n4,567 \n$\n4,509 \n(1)\n%\n1 \n%\nFertilizer\n3,809\n \n3,962 \n3,749 \n(4)\n6 \nFood & refrigerated\n6,104\n \n5,929 \n5,844 \n3\n \n1 \nCoal & renewables\n2,113\n \n2,211 \n2,410 \n(4)\n(8)\nBulk\n3,710\n \n3,623 \n3,658 \n2\n \n(1)\nIndustrial chemicals & plastics\n3,493\n \n3,374 \n3,388 \n4\n \n- \nMetals & minerals\n2,893\n \n2,765 \n2,797 \n5\n \n(1)\nForest products\n6,229\n \n6,310 \n6,092 \n(1)\n4 \nEnergy & specialized markets\n4,426\n \n4,335 \n4,320 \n2\n \n- \nIndustrial\n3,818\n \n3,689 \n3,704 \n3\n \n- \nAutomotive\n2,976\n \n2,955 \n2,902 \n1\n \n2 \nIntermodal [a]\n1,404\n \n1,504 \n1,656 \n(7)\n(9)\nPremium\n1,714\n \n1,813 \n1,905 \n(5)\n(5)\nAverage\n$\n2,737\n \n$\n2,782 \n$\n2,835 \n(2)\n%\n(2)\n%\n[a]\nFor intermodal shipments, each container or trailer equals one carload.\n26\nTable of \nContents\nBulk\n – Bulk includes shipments of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. Freight revenues from bulk shipments decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to lower volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenues, partially offset by positive mix, from decreased coal shipments, and core pricing gains. Volumes declined 4% compared to 2023 driven by reduced use of coal in electricity generation because of low natural gas prices, coal fired plant capacity, and mild winter weather, partially offset by strength in export grain to Mexico and several other grain products. Additionally, the volume declines were partially offset by increased fertilizer shipments due to strong demand and a 2023 customer outage. Volumes for coal and renewables and food and refrigerated shipments were negatively impacted by outages and service challenges due to repeated snow events in Wyoming and flooding in California in the first quarter of 2023 positively impacting the year-over-year comparisons.\nIndustrial\n – Industrial includes shipments of industrial chemicals and plastics, metals and minerals, forest products, and energy and specialized markets. Freight revenues from industrial shipments increased in 2024 versus 2023 due to core pricing gains and positive mix of traffic from decreased short haul rock shipments and increased petroleum shipments, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues and lower volumes. Volumes decreased 1% compared to 2023 driven by lower demand for rock, due to weather, high inventories, and softness in Southern markets, and decreased sand shipments due to the use of local sources, partially offset by strength in petroleum, industrial chemicals, and plastics.\nPremium\n – Premium includes shipments of finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. Freight revenues from premium shipments increased driven by higher volumes and core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix. Starting in the third quarter of 2024, international intermodal experienced heavy demand due to increased U.S. West Coast imports, a result of freight shifting from the East Coast and Canadian ports due to uncertainty related to labor negotiations, driving volumes up over 30% in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2023. In addition, business development efforts in domestic intermodal drove volume growth in 2024 compared to 2023. Automotive shipments were flat year-over-year as business development wins were offset by market weakness and unplanned production decreases.\n2024 Bulk Carloads\n2024 Industrial Carloads\n2024 Premium Carloads\nMexico Business\n – Freight revenues from each of our commodity groups includes revenues from shipments to and from Mexico, which amounted to $3.0 billion in 2024, up 8% compared to 2023, driven by a 3% volumes increase and a 4% increase in ARC. The volume increases were driven by higher grain and grain product shipments and finished vehicle shipments, partially offset by lower automotive parts shipments.\nOperating Expenses\nMillions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% Change 2024 v 2023\n% Change 2023 v 2022\nCompensation and benefits\n$\n4,899\n \n$\n4,818 \n$\n4,645 \n2\n \n%\n4 \n%\nPurchased services and materials\n2,520\n \n2,616 \n2,442 \n(4)\n7 \nFuel\n2,474\n \n2,891 \n3,439 \n(14)\n(16)\nDepreciation\n2,398\n \n2,318 \n2,246 \n3\n \n3 \nEquipment and other rents\n920\n \n947 \n898 \n(3)\n5 \nOther\n1,326\n \n1,447 \n1,288 \n(8)\n12 \nTotal\n$\n14,537\n \n$\n15,037 \n$\n14,958 \n(3)\n%\n1 \n%\n27\nTable of \nContents\nOperating expenses decreased $500 million, or 3%, in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by lower fuel prices, productivity, a gain on the sale of intermodal equipment in 2024, partially offset by inflation, volume-related costs, and higher depreciation. In addition, positively impacting the year-over-year comparison are lower labor agreement ratification charges as we reached agreements impacting crew staffing in both years, and lower weather-related costs from less impactful winter weather in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2023.\n2024 Operating Expenses\nCompensation and Benefits\n – Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentive costs. In 2024, expenses increased 2% compared to 2023 due to wage inflation, which includes the impact of labor agreements to modernize work rules and improve availability, higher incentive compensation, and increased crew needs associated with labor agreements and increased volumes, partially offset by 4% lower employee levels. Train, engine, and yard (TE&Y) force levels were flat compared to 2023 as improved network fluidity allowed us to handle a 3% increase in volumes and the increased needs associated with labor agreements without increasing the size of that workforce.\nPurchased Services and Materials\n – Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials decreased 4% in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by declines in locomotive maintenance expense due to a smaller active fleet as productivity improved year-over-year, decreased volume-related drayage cost incurred at one of our subsidiaries, and a favorable contract settlement, partially offset by inflation and volume-related costs.\nFuel\n – Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Fuel expense decreased compared to 2023 due to a decrease in locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.64 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2024 compared to $3.09 per gallon in 2023, resulting in a $0.4 billion decrease in expense (excluding any impact from decreased volumes year-over-year), and a 1% improvement to the fuel consumption rate in 2024 (computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles), partially offset by a 1% increase in gross ton-miles.\nDepreciation\n – The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation expense was up 3% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a higher depreciable asset base.\nEquipment and Other Rents \n– Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses, offset by equity income from certain equity method investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 3% compared to 2023 due to lower lease expense and improved cycle times, partially offset by increased demand in commodities utilizing freight cars owned by others and inflation.\nOther\n – Other expenses include state and local taxes; freight, equipment, and property damage; utilities; insurance; personal injury; environmental; employee travel; telephone and cellular; computer software; bad debt; and other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 8% in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by lower personal injury costs, a 2024 gain on the sale of intermodal equipment, and a 2023 write-off, partially offset by higher freight loss and damage and other casualty cost.\nNon-Operating Items\nMillions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% Change 2024 v 2023\n% Change 2023 v 2022\nOther income, net\n$\n350\n \n$\n491 \n$\n426 \n(29)\n%\n15 \n%\nInterest expense\n(1,269)\n(1,340)\n(1,271)\n(5)\n5 \nIncome tax expense\n$\n(2,047)\n$\n(1,854)\n$\n(2,074)\n10\n \n%\n(11)\n%\nOther Income, net\n – Other income decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by a $107 million real estate transaction in 2023 and lower income from other real estate transactions, partially offset by interest received in 2024 from the IRS on refund claims. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, for additional detail.\n28\nTable of \nContents\nInterest Expense\n – Interest expense decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a decreased weighted-average debt level of $31.6 billion in 2024 from $33.2 billion in 2023. The effective interest rate was 4.0% in both periods.\nIncome Tax Expense\n – Income tax expense increased in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by higher pre-tax income in 2024 and higher deferred tax expense reductions in 2023, partially offset by the benefit of purchased federal tax credits in 2024. In 2024, the states of Louisiana and Arkansas enacted legislation to reduce their corporate income tax rates for future years resulting in a $34 million reduction of our deferred tax expense. In 2023, the states of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Arkansas enacted legislation to reduce their corporate income tax rates for future years resulting in a $114 million reduction of our deferred tax expense. Our effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 were 23.3% and 22.5%, respectively.\nOTHER OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS\nWe report a number of key performance measures weekly to the STB. We provide these on our website at https://investor.unionpacific.com/key-performance-metrics.\nOperating/Performance Statistics\nManagement continuously monitors these key operating metrics to evaluate our operational efficiency in striving to deliver the service product we sold to our customers.\nRailroad performance measures are included in the table below:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% Change 2024 v 2023\n% Change 2023 v 2022\nGross ton-miles (GTMs) (billions)\n847.4\n837.5\n843.4\n1\n \n%\n(1)\n%\nRevenue ton-miles (billions)\n409.7\n413.3\n420.8\n(1)\n(2)\nFreight car velocity (daily miles per car) [a]\n208\n204\n191\n2\n \n7 \nAverage train speed (miles per hour) [a]\n23.6\n24.2\n23.8\n(2)\n2 \nAverage terminal dwell time (hours) [a]\n22.6\n23.4\n24.4\n(3)\n(4)\nLocomotive productivity (GTMs per horsepower day)\n135\n129\n125\n5\n \n3 \nTrain length (feet)\n9,469\n9,356\n9,329\n1\n \n- \nIntermodal service performance index (%)\n90\n \n88 \n76 \n2\n \n pts\n12 \n pts\nManifest service performance index (%)\n89\n \n85 \n77 \n4\n \n pts\n8 \n pts\nWorkforce productivity (car miles per employee)\n1,062\n1,000\n1,036\n6\n \n(3)\nTotal employees (average)\n30,336\n31,490\n30,717\n(4)\n3 \nOperating ratio (%)\n59.9\n \n62.3 \n60.1 \n(2.4)\npts\n2.2 \npts\n[a]\nAs reported to the STB.\nGross and Revenue Ton-Miles\n – Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. In 2024, gross ton-miles increased 1% and revenue ton-miles decreased 1%, while carloadings were up 3% year-over-year. Changes in commodity mix drove the year-over-year variances between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads due to lower coal shipments, which are heavier, and increased international intermodal shipments that are lighter.\nFreight Car Velocity\n – Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals (average train speed) and the time a rail car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Freight car velocity increased 2% driven by record terminal dwell levels. The 2023 metrics were negatively impacted by operational challenges caused by weather in the first quarter and train crew shortages in some locations in the first half of 2023, positively impacting the year-over-year comparison.\nLocomotive Productivity\n – Locomotive productivity is gross ton-miles per average daily locomotive horsepower. Locomotive productivity improved 5% in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by improved network fluidity and asset utilization despite maintaining a buffer in 2024 to flex the fleet size as we experienced and subsequently recovered from certain weather events and reacted to higher volume levels.\n29\nTable of \nContents\nTrain Length\n – Train length is the average maximum train length on a route measured in feet. Our train length increased 1% compared to 2023 due to train length improvement initiatives and increases in international intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains, partially offset by declines in coal train length.\nService Performance Index (SPI)\n – SPI is a ratio of the service customers are currently receiving relative to the best monthly performance over the last three years. Measuring our performance relative to a historical benchmark demonstrates our focus on continuously improving service for our customers, and we believe it is a better indicator of service performance than the previously disclosed trip plan compliance. SPI does not replace the service commitments we have contractually agreed to with a small number of customers. SPI is calculated for intermodal and manifest products. Intermodal SPI improved 2 points, at the same time international volume surged. Manifest SPI improved 4 points in 2024 compared to 2023.\nWorkforce Productivity\n – Workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee. Workforce productivity improved 6% in 2024 as average daily car miles increased 2% and employees decreased 4% compared to 2023. Our active TE&Y workforce increased to support carload demand and increased crew needs associated with labor agreements that went into effect in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, we are maintaining an adequate training pipeline to provide a capacity buffer to enable responsiveness in an ever-changing demand and operating environment.\nOperating Ratio\n – Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenues. Our operating ratio of 59.9% improved 2.4 points compared to 2023 driven by productivity initiatives, core pricing gains, and the year-over-year impact from lower fuel prices, partially offset by inflation and other costs. In addition, operating ratio year-over-year comparison was positively impacted by 2024 contract settlements, a 2024 gain on the sale of intermodal equipment, and lower labor agreement ratification charges than in 2023.\nReturn on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity\nMillions, Except Percentages\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n6,747\n \n$\n6,379 \n$\n6,998 \nAverage equity\n$\n15,839\n \n$\n13,476 \n$\n13,162 \nReturn on average common shareholders' equity\n42.6\n \n%\n47.3 \n%\n53.2 \n%\nReturn on Invested Capital as Adjusted (ROIC)\nMillions, Except Percentages\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n6,747\n \n$\n6,379 \n$\n6,998 \nInterest expense\n1,269\n \n1,340 \n1,271 \nInterest on average operating lease liabilities\n55\n \n58 \n56 \nTaxes on interest\n(308)\n(315)\n(304)\nNet operating profit after taxes as adjusted\n$\n7,763\n \n$\n7,462 \n$\n8,021 \nAverage equity\n$\n15,839\n \n$\n13,476 \n$\n13,162 \nAverage debt\n31,886\n \n32,953 \n31,528 \nAverage operating lease liabilities\n1,436\n \n1,616 \n1,695 \nAverage invested capital as adjusted\n$\n49,161\n \n$\n48,045 \n$\n46,385 \nReturn on invested capital as adjusted\n15.8\n \n%\n15.5 \n%\n17.3 \n%\nROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criterion in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity. The tables above provide a reconciliation from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC. At December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.8%, 3.6%, and 3.3%, respectively.\n30\nTable of \nContents\nDebt / Net Income\nMillions, Except Ratios\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDebt\n$\n31,192\n \n$\n32,579 \n$\n33,326 \nNet income\n$\n6,747\n \n$\n6,379 \n$\n6,998 \nDebt / net income\n4.6\n5.1\n4.8\nAdjusted Debt / Adjusted EBITDA\nMillions, Except Ratios\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n6,747\n \n$\n6,379 \n$\n6,998 \nAdd:\nIncome tax expense\n2,047\n \n1,854 \n2,074 \nDepreciation\n2,398\n \n2,318 \n2,246 \nInterest expense\n1,269\n \n1,340 \n1,271 \nEBITDA\n$\n12,461\n \n$\n11,891 \n$\n12,589 \nAdjustments:\nOther income, net\n(350)\n(491)\n(426)\nInterest on operating lease liabilities\n48\n \n58 \n54 \nAdjusted EBITDA (a)\n$\n12,159\n \n$\n11,458 \n$\n12,217 \nDebt\n$\n31,192\n \n$\n32,579 \n$\n33,326 \nOperating lease liabilities\n1,271\n \n1,600 \n1,631 \nAdjusted debt (b)\n$\n32,463\n \n$\n34,179 \n$\n34,957 \nAdjusted debt / adjusted EBITDA (b/a)\n2.7\n3.0\n2.9\nAdjusted debt (total debt plus operating lease liabilities plus after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefit) obligations) to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company’s credit rating. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is debt to net income ratio. The tables above provide reconciliations from net income to adjusted EBITDA, debt to adjusted debt, and debt to net income to adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. At December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.8%, 3.6%, and 3.3%, respectively. Pension and OPEB were funded at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash. These analyses inform our liquidity plans and activities outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities. It is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit, and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. We generate strong cash from operations and also maintain adequate resources, including our credit facility and, when necessary, access the capital markets to meet foreseeable cash requirements.\nDuring 2024, we generated $9.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities, paid down $1.3 billion of long-term debt, paid $3.2 billion in dividends, and repurchased shares totaling $1.5 billion. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants. \nOur principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, our Receivables Facility, our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. On December 31, 2024, we had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $800 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2024, none of the revolving credit \n31\nTable of \nContents\nfacility was drawn, and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during 2024. Our access to the Receivables Facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities: (a) increasing the utilization of our Receivables Facility, (b) issuing commercial paper, (c) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Company’s $2.0 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short-term needs. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.\nAs described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), as of the date of this filing, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are like those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.\nThe following table identifies material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024:\nPayments Due by December 31,\nMillions\nTotal\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nAfter\n 2029\nDebt [a]\n$\n57,906 \n$\n2,591 \n$\n2,617 \n$\n2,348 \n$\n2,294 \n$\n2,253 \n$\n45,803 \nPurchase obligations [b]\n2,110 \n999 \n590 \n240 \n160 \n121 \n- \nOperating leases [c]\n1,401 \n352 \n281 \n227 \n200 \n128 \n213 \nOther post-retirement benefits [d]\n378 \n39 \n39 \n38 \n38 \n38 \n186 \nFinance lease obligations [e]\n118 \n42 \n35 \n30 \n11 \n- \n- \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n61,913 \n$\n4,023 \n$\n3,562 \n$\n2,883 \n$\n2,703 \n$\n2,540 \n$\n46,202 \n[a]\nExcludes finance lease obligations of $109 million as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of ($1,693) million.

Cash flow conversion rate is not considered a financial measure under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe cash \n32\nTable of \nContents\nflow conversion rate is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. Cash flow conversion rate should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to cash flow conversion rate (non-GAAP measure):\nMillions, Except Percentages\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n9,346\n \n$\n8,379 \n$\n9,362 \nCash used in capital investments\n(3,452)\n(3,606)\n(3,620)\nTotal (a)\n5,894\n \n4,773 \n5,742 \nNet income (b)\n$\n6,747\n \n$\n6,379 \n$\n6,998 \nCash flow conversion rate (a/b)\n87\n \n%\n75 \n%\n82 \n%\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2024 decreased compared to 2023 primarily driven by less capital investments and higher proceeds from asset sales, including a sale of intermodal equipment. Roughly half of the year-over-year decrease in capital investments is attributable to the 2023 purchase of a small trucking and transload operator and related real estate assets.\nThe following table detail cash capital investments for the years ended December 31:\nMillions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTies\n$\n503\n \n$\n565 \n$\n544 \nRail and other track material\n493\n \n454 \n437 \nBallast\n197\n \n194 \n216 \nOther [a]\n740\n \n691 \n693 \nTotal road infrastructure replacements\n1,933\n \n1,904 \n1,890 \nLine expansion and other capacity projects\n183\n \n239 \n276 \nCommercial facilities\n317\n \n425 \n308 \nTotal capacity and commercial facilities\n500\n \n664 \n584 \nLocomotives and freight cars [b]\n788\n \n728 \n800 \nTechnology and other\n231\n \n310 \n346 \nTotal cash capital investments [c]\n$\n3,452\n \n$\n3,606 \n$\n3,620 \n[a]\nOther includes bridges and tunnels, signals, other road assets, and road work equipment.\n[b]\nLocomotives and freight cars include lease buyouts of $143 million, $57 million, and $70 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n[c]\nWeather-related damages for 2024, 2023, and 2022 are immaterial.\nCapital Plan\n – In 2025, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.4 billion, consistent with 2024. We plan to continue to make investments to support our growth strategy, improve the safety, resiliency, and operational efficiency of the network, harden our infrastructure, and replace older assets, including modernization of our locomotive fleet and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. In addition, the plan includes investments in growth-related projects to drive more carloads to the network and enhance productivity. This includes siding construction and extension projects, terminal investments supporting our manifest network, and invest in certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers. The capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities increased in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by an increase in share repurchases and a decrease in debt issued, partially offset by a decrease in the repayment of commercial paper.\nSee Note 14 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings, and Note 18 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, for a description of our share repurchase programs.\n33\nTable of \nContents\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\n – For capital-intensive companies, inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for long-lived assets. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.\nSensitivity Analyses\n – The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest and tax rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.\nInterest Rates\n – At December 31, 2024, we did not have variable-rate debt.\nMarket risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2024, and totals an increase of approximately $3.0 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2024. We estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.\nTax Rates\n – Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on current tax law. Future tax legislation, such as a change in the federal corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. For example, a future, permanent 1% increase in our federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $525 million. Similarly, a future, permanent 1% decrease in our federal income tax rate would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately $525 million.\nAccounting Pronouncements\n – See Note 3 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nAsserted and Unasserted Claims\n – See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nIndemnities\n – See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nClimate Change\n – Climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report). We utilize climate scenario analyses to better understand climate-related risks and opportunities the Company may face in the future under a range of potential scenarios. We continue to refine our approach to understand climate-related risks and are taking an iterative approach in our business planning processes as risk factors, solutions, and technology develop. However, we are unable to predict the likelihood, manner, severity, or ultimate financial impact of actual future incidents as climate scenario analysis considers a range of potential outcomes.\nWe continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce our operational impact on the environment, including improving our operational fluidity to increase fuel efficiency, modernizing locomotives for improved reliability and fuel consumption, using renewable fuels, and exploring and testing low- and zero-emissions propulsion technologies. These initiatives are aligned with our strategy of Safety, Service, and Operational Excellence leading to Growth. (See further discussion in \"Sustainable Future\" in the Operations section in Item 1 of this report.)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting estimates are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting estimates affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.\nPersonal Injury\n – See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and \"\nWe May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures\n\" in the Risk Factors, Item 1A.\nOur personal injury liability is subject to uncertainty due to unasserted claims, timing and outcome of claims, and evolving trends in litigation. There were no material changes to the assumptions used in the latest actuarial analysis.\n34\nTable of \nContents\nOur personal injury liability balance and claims activity was as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEnding liability balance at December 31 (millions)\n$\n379\n \n$\n383 \n$\n361 \nOpen claims, beginning balance\n1,871\n \n2,036 \n2,027 \nNew claims\n2,842\n \n3,008 \n2,747 \nSettled or dismissed claims\n(3,146)\n(3,173)\n(2,738)\nOpen claims, ending balance at December 31\n1,567\n \n1,871 \n2,036 \nEnvironmental Costs\n – See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8; \"\nWe Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations\n\" in the Risk Factors, Item 1A; and Environmental Matters in the Legal Proceedings, Item 3.\nOur environmental liability is subject to several factors such as type of remediation, nature and volume of contaminate, number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, as well as uncertainty due to unknown alleged contamination, evolving trends in remediation techniques and final remedies, and changes in laws and regulations.\nOur environmental liability balance and site activity was as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEnding liability balance at December 31 (millions)\n$\n268\n \n$\n245 \n$\n253 \nOpen sites, beginning balance\n333\n \n353 \n376 \nNew sites\n84\n \n74 \n69 \nClosed sites\n(65)\n(94)\n(92)\nOpen sites, ending balance at December 31\n352\n \n333 \n353 \nProperty and Depreciation\n – See Note 11 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nAssets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property.\nEstimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets. We are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets. Actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.\nChanges in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $73 million. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $78 million. We are projecting an increase in our depreciation expense of approximately 3% to 4% in 2025 versus 2024. This is driven by an increase in our projected depreciable asset base.\nPension Plans\n – See Note 5 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. \nThe critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets. \nWe evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:\n•\nWe measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic pension benefit/cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Discount rates are based on a Mercer yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds (rated AA by a recognized rating agency).\n•\nExpected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions.\n35\nTable of \nContents\nThe following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension benefit/cost for 2025 and the estimated impact on 2025 net periodic pension benefit/cost relative to a change in those assumptions:\nAssumptions\nDiscount rate for benefit obligations\n5.61 \n%\nDiscount rate for interest on benefit obligations\n5.32 \n%\nDiscount rate for service cost\n5.75 \n%\nDiscount rate for interest on service cost\n5.68 \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n5.25 \n%\nSensitivities\nMillions\nIncrease in Expense\nPension\n0.25% decrease in discount rates\n$\n- \n0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets\n$\n12 \nThe following table presents the net periodic pension benefit/cost for the years ended December 31:\nMillions\nEst.\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet periodic pension (benefit)/cost\n$\n(10)\n$\n(3)\n$\n- \n$\n9 \nCAUTIONARY INFORMATION\nCertain statements in this report, and statements in other reports or information filed or to be filed with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us), are, or will be, forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
