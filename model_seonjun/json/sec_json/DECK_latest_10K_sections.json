  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nWe are a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: UGG, HOKA, Teva, AHNU, and Koolaburra. Our brands compete across the fashion and casual lifestyle, performance, running, and outdoor markets. We believe our products are distinctive and appeal to a broad demographic. Our brands sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to global consumers through our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel, which is comprised of an e‑commerce and retail store presence. We seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize fashion, authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups. Independent third-party contractors manufacture all of our products (independent manufacturers).\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nKoolaburra Brand. \nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we began taking steps to phase out our standalone operations for the Koolaburra brand in order to maintain focus on our most significant organic opportunities. We closed Koolaburra.com as of March 31, 2025, and plan to wind down the Koolaburra brand in the wholesale channel by the end of calendar year 2025. Refer to the section titled “The Company,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information.\n3\nTable of \nContents\nSanuk Brand Asset Sale.\n We completed the sale of our Sanuk brand and certain related assets on August 15, 2024 (Sanuk Brand Sale Date). Refer to the section titled “The Company,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on the sale of Sanuk brand. \nForward Stock Split and Authorized Share Increase.\n On September 13, 2024, we effected a stock split and an authorized share increase. Our financial results included within this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effectiveness of the stock split and the authorized share increase. Refer to the section titled “Basis of Presentation,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information.\nBRANDS\nUGG. \nThe UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized footwear brands in our industry, which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient consumer-focused line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories with year-round product offerings that appeal to a growing global audience and a broad demographic.\nHOKA\n. \nThe HOKA brand is an authentic premium line of year-round performance footwear, which offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight. Originally designed for ultra-runners, the brand now appeals to world champions, taste makers, and everyday athletes. Expanded marketing and strategic marketplace presence have fueled both domestic and international sales growth of the HOKA brand, which has quickly become a leading brand within run and outdoor specialty wholesale accounts and is growing across its global marketplace. The HOKA brand’s product line includes running, trail, hiking, fitness, and lifestyle footwear offerings, as well as select apparel and accessories.\nOther Brands.\n Other brands consist primarily of the Teva brand, AHNU brand, and Koolaburra brand. The Teva brand’s products are built for a range of outdoor pursuits and include a variety of footwear options, from classic sandals and shoes to boots. The AHNU brand’s footwear products fuse high-performance technology with timeless style crafted for everyday wear. The Koolaburra brand, for which we are phasing out standalone operations by the end of calendar year 2025, is a casual footwear brand that uses plush materials to target value-oriented consumers.\nAs discussed under the section titled “Recent Developments” above, the sale of the Sanuk brand was completed during fiscal year 2025. The financial results for our reportable operating segments present the former Sanuk brand within the Other brands reportable operating segment through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date for the year ended March 31, 2025, and full financial results for the years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments” below for further details about our reportable operating segments. \nCHANNEL DISTRIBUTION\nWholesale.\n Our wholesale channel sells products to a network of third-party retailers, including partner retailers, and distributors. This approach enables us to expand market reach and leverage the scale and operational capabilities of its wholesale partners to serve a broad base of end consumers.\nWe sell our UGG brand products primarily through fashion lifestyle retailers, higher-end department stores, streetwear and sports style partners, online retailers and partner retailers. As the retail marketplace continues to evolve to reflect changing consumer preferences, we continually review and evaluate our UGG wholesale distribution and product segmentation approach. \nWe sell our HOKA brand products primarily through full-service specialty retailers, outdoor and sporting goods retailers, select online retailers, fashion lifestyle retailers, sports style partners, and higher-end department stores. We continue to expand our HOKA brand wholesale distribution globally, including through additional mono-branded locations operated by partner retailers. \n4\nTable of \nContents\nWe sell our Teva brand products primarily through outdoor and sporting goods retailers, fashion lifestyle retailers, large national retail chains, higher-end department stores, and online retailers. We sell our AHNU brand footwear through domestic streetwear and lifestyle boutiques and retailers. \nDirect-to-Consumer. \nOur DTC channel is comprised of our Company-owned e-commerce websites and retail stores where products are sold at retail prices. Our e-commerce websites and retail stores are intertwined and interdependent in an omni-channel marketplace, providing a fluid purchasing experience, which engenders brand loyalty while increasing product sales and improving our inventory productivity. In addition, we believe many of our consumers interact with both before making purchasing decisions in store and online. For example, consumers may feel or try on products in our retail stores and then place an order online later. Conversely, they may initially research products online and then view inventory availability by store location and make a purchase in store. \nE-Commerce Websites. \nOur global e-commerce websites provide us with an opportunity to directly engage and connect with our consumers and communicate a consistent message that promotes awareness of our brands’ promises and key initiatives, offers targeted information to specific consumer demographics, and drives consumers to our retail stores. As of March 31, 2025, we operate Company-owned e-commerce websites in 56 different countries.\nRetail Stores. \nRetail stores enable us to expose consumers to a curated selection of products and directly influence our consumers’ experience with our brands. Our Company-owned mono-branded retail stores are predominantly UGG brand concept and outlet stores, as well as HOKA brand concept stores, which we continue to open in key markets to further grow our brand presence and appeal to a broader consumer base. As of March 31, 2025, we have a total of\n \n179\n \nglobal Company-owned retail stores (including 137 UGG brand retail stores and 42 HOKA brand retail stores), which include\n \n92\n \nconcept stores and 87\n \noutlet stores.\nRetail store definitions are as follows:\n•\nConcept Stores. \nConcept stores are Company-owned mono-branded stores launched in strategic locations, designed to offer a curated, themed experience and a unique selection of products, aiming to evoke a specific lifestyle for our brands. Concept stores include the following:\n◦\nFlagship Stores.\n Premium mono-branded stores in key global markets, such as major tourist locations typically with above average square footage, designed to provide broader product offerings and generate greater traffic that enhances the consumer experience and increases brand loyalty.\n◦\nShop-in-shop (SIS) Stores.\n SIS stores are operated by us or non-employees within a department store, which we lease from the store owner by paying a percentage of store sales and for which we own the inventory.\n•\nOutlet Stores. \nOutlet stores are Company-owned stores designed to sell certain discontinued styles from prior seasons, full price in-line products, and products made specifically for the outlet stores.\nGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION\nUS Distribution.\n In our wholesale channel, we sell our products in the US through sales representatives, organized by brand and either geography or account type, as each brand generally has certain specialty customers that expect a dedicated sales team with specialized knowledge of the brand’s product offerings. In addition to our wholesale channel, we sell products directly to consumers through our DTC channel and fulfill online orders through our warehouses, DCs, and retail stores. \nWe currently distribute products sold in the US through our DCs in Moreno Valley, California, and Mooresville, Indiana. We also distribute products to our wholesale channel customers through a DC bypass program. Our warehouses and DCs feature a warehouse management system that enables us to efficiently pick and pack products for direct shipment to customers and consumers. \n5\nTable of \nContents\nInternational Distribution.\n Collectively, our brands are sold internationally in Canada, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. We sell our products internationally in our wholesale channel through wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors, some of which operate partner retail stores. In addition, in certain countries we sell products through our DTC channel. For our wholesale and DTC channels, we distribute our products through a number of warehouses and DCs managed by 3PLs in certain international locations. \nRefer to Part I, Item 2, “Properties,” and Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our properties and related minimum lease and other commitments. Refer to Note 13, “Concentration of Business,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for additional information regarding geographic areas and concentration of related business risks. \nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we updated our reportable operating segments to better reflect changes in the way our CODM makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance. In connection with executive leadership alignment, and the recent divestiture and phase out of certain brands, the CODM shifted resource allocation decisions and performance assessment to a brand focus, rather than a distribution channel focus. As of March 31, 2025, our three reportable operating segments include the worldwide operations of the UGG brand, HOKA brand, and Other brands (collectively, our reportable operating segments). \nRefer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the section titled “Basis of Presentation,” in Note 1, “General,” and to Note 12, “Reportable Operating Segments,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for additional information regarding the recent change in our reportable operating segments and our results of operations.\nPRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT\nOur design and development teams work closely with each brand’s product management teams to create seasonal product lines designed to meet and exceed consumer expectations. Each brand follows a similar product creation path starting with consumer insights, including engagement with key consumer segments, color, trend, material research, and in-depth market analysis. Throughout the creation process there are multiple concept and design reviews to develop prototypes which are assembled through our independent manufacturers. Depending on the brand and product application, there may be multiple rounds of samples for fit, dynamic or athlete testing, and on occasion, we may contract with external laboratories for additional research needs. Our diverse product offering enables us to leverage learnings across each of our brands, enabling innovation and economies of scale. Throughout the entire design and development process we evaluate the availability and costs of raw materials, the capabilities and capacities of our independent manufacturers, and the target pricing of our products.\nMANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN\nThe production of our finished goods is outsourced to independent manufacturers, which are primarily located in Southeast Asia, predominately in Vietnam.\nProduction by our independent manufacturers is performed in accordance with our detailed product specifications and rigorous quality control and operating compliance standards. We maintain a buying office in Hong Kong, as well as on-site supervisory offices in Vietnam, China, and Indonesia, which collectively serve as a strong link to our independent manufacturers. We believe our substantial regional presence enhances our manufacturing processes by providing predictability of material availability and ensuring adherence to quality control standards and final design specifications. \nWe generally purchase products from independent manufacturers on the basis of individual purchase orders, rather than maintaining long-term purchase commitments, which provides us greater flexibility to adapt to changing consumer preferences, changes in international trade relations, and evolving inventory management requirements. From a sourcing perspective, less than 5% of our finished goods for footwear comes from China while the remainder comes from Southeast Asia, predominately from Vietnam.\n6\nTable of \nContents\nThe majority of the raw materials and components used in the production of our products by our independent manufacturers are purchased from independent suppliers that we designate (designated suppliers), who work with subcontractors that extract, process, or convert these raw materials. \nSheepskin used to manufacture a significant portion of our UGG brand products and is sourced primarily from designated suppliers in Australia and processed by two tanneries in China. We enter into fixed purchasing contracts with designated suppliers of sheepskin and, at times, sugarcane-derived ethylene-vinyl acetate (sugarcane-derived EVA) to manage price volatility and ensure availability. Excluding sheepskin, UGGplush, and sugarcane-derived EVA, we believe that substantially all raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are generally available from multiple sources at competitive prices. We believe current supplies are sufficient to meet our anticipated demand for the next 12 months. \nRefer to the subsection titled “Contractual Obligations” under the section “Liquidity” within Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our minimum purchase commitments.\nWe require our independent manufacturers and designated suppliers to adopt our Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code of Conduct), which requires them to comply with all local laws and regulations governing human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption, restricted substances, and environmental compliance, including animal welfare and conflict minerals, before we are willing to conduct business with them. Refer to the section titled “Environmental, Social, and Governance” below for further information. \nINVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCT RETURNS\nWe have an extended design and manufacturing process, which involves the initial design of our products, the purchase of raw and other materials, the accumulation of inventories, the subsequent sale of the inventories, and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable. This production cycle results in significant liquidity requirements and working capital fluctuations throughout our fiscal year. Because our production cycle typically involves long lead times, which requires us to make manufacturing decisions several months in advance of an anticipated purchasing decision by the customer, it is challenging for us to estimate and manage our inventory and working capital requirements. \nWe seek to manage our inventory levels by considering existing orders, as well as forecasted sales and budgets by brand for both the wholesale and DTC channels, including consideration of the delivery requirements of our customers. Our systems and processes are designed to improve our product planning and forecasting, inventory control and supply chain management capabilities, including our Company-owned e-commerce websites. In addition, added discipline around SKU productivity, product purchasing decisions, the reduction of production lead times, and the sale of excess inventory through our liquidation channels, are key areas of focus that have enhanced inventory performance, including higher inventory turnover, and partially mitigated product cost increases.\nOur general practice, and the general practice in our industry, is to offer customers in our wholesale channel the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise, and to accept returns from our consumers in the DTC channel between 30 to 90 days from the point of sale for cash or credit.\nWe encourage our customers to place a significant portion of orders as pre-season orders, which are typically placed up to 12 months prior to the anticipated shipment date, and also provide customers the ability to place in-season fill-in orders that can be shipped immediately. We work with our customers through pre-season programs to enable us to better plan our production schedule, inventory, and shipping requirements. \nRefer to the sections titled “Trends and Uncertainties Impacting Our Business and Industry” and “Liquidity” within Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report for further information on our supply chain infrastructure capabilities, working capital and operating requirements, and purchase obligations for product.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE\nAs a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories, our worldwide reach and impact is significant. We believe consumers are increasingly buying brands that deliver quality products while striving for minimal environmental impact by employing sustainable business practices. Our sustainability policies and strategies are informed by our ongoing efforts with multi-stakeholder initiatives, which involve our stockholders, employees, suppliers, and customers, as well as other brands and non-governmental organizations. \nThrough our holistic ESG program, which has been in existence since 2010, we are committed to advancing our sustainable business initiatives. As a result of our efforts, during fiscal year 2025, we have been recognized as one of Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies, by TIME as one of the Most Sustainable Companies, by Forbes as one of America’s Best Companies, by Newsweek as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies and as one of America’s Greenest Companies. \nESG Oversight. \nOur Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee (Corporate Governance Committee) is comprised of four independent members of our Board of Directors (Board) who oversee our ESG strategy and have ultimate oversight over all sustainability initiatives, strategies, and programs, including economic, social, and environmental risks. The Corporate Governance Committee and Board regularly receive updates on the status of our ESG program. In addition, the Audit & Risk Management Committee (Audit Committee) of the Board periodically assesses risk management, including climate-related risks and policies, to ensure a consistent corporate strategy. The Board considers whether the ESG program adequately identifies material risks in a timely fashion, implements appropriate responsive risk management strategies, and transmits necessary information with respect to material risks within the organization. Our Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) is responsible for the day-to-day management of our ESG program. The program’s execution is driven by our leadership team and various cross-functional teams including our ethical sourcing, facilities, warehouses and DCs, brands, innovation, materials, and supply chain teams.\nOur ESG program aligns our internal teams with our Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and establishes policies to encourage our partners and suppliers to employ sustainable business practices. We annually assess risks related to ESG issues as part of our overall enterprise risk management approach. In addition, our internal audit team provides periodic targeted reviews of our ESG-related policies and procedures to the Audit Committee.\nStakeholder Engagement\n. We highly value stakeholder input and have consistently demonstrated our commitment to maintaining open and interactive dialogue on ESG matters with our stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations, employees, stockholders, suppliers, industry groups, communities, and governments, to ensure their views are actively considered in executing our ESG program. Our stakeholder outreach program is led by a cross-functional team that includes members of our investor relations, compliance, sustainability, and legal teams. Additionally, we actively engage with our employees to obtain valuable feedback and track progress, including through regular employee engagement surveys. \nSustainable Development Goals. \nWe work to establish SDGs that we believe are the most relevant to our business, our operations, our stockholders, and the communities in which we operate. We are a member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative. This membership requires an annual statement of progress, which is reflected in our Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report (Creating Change Report). Our CAO identifies specific SDGs established by the UNGC, which we adopt to guide our ESG strategy. \nOur annual Creating Change Report for the year ended March 31, 2025, which will be published in calendar year 2025 under the “Responsibility” tab of our website located at\n \nir.deckers.com\n, will provide more information regarding our fiscal year 2025 ESG achievements with a focus on the SDGs discussed below. The content of our website, including our Creating Change Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. \n8\nTable of \nContents\nWe believe the progress of our corporate responsibility efforts is evidenced by disclosing goals and relevant metrics and, to that end, we have aligned the reporting standards included in our Creating Change Report with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (commonly referred to as TCFD), Global Reporting Initiative’s (commonly referred to as GRI) Core Standards, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (commonly referred to as SASB), and now part of the International Finance Reporting Standard (or IFRS) Foundation Consumer Goods Sector Apparel, Accessories and Footwear Index. \nHUMAN CAPITAL - OUR PEOPLE AND OUR CULTURE\nEmployees\n. \nAs of March 31, 2025, we employed approximately 5,500 employees, reflecting an increase of 14.6%, compared to March 31, 2024, in North America, Europe, and Asia. This includes approximately 2,000 employees in our retail stores but excludes temporary and seasonal employees.\nCulture\n. \nOur key values, which guide our journey onward together to improve our business and create a better world around us, and help hold us accountable to deliver on this purpose, are as follows:\n•\nCome as you are.\n Authentic employees create an authentic company. \n•\nBetter together.\n The power of independent spirit, united for a common goal. \n•\nCommit to create.\n Curiosity fuels creativity, which in turn fuels innovation. \n•\nOwn it.\n We set high targets and hit them and take accountability when we don’t. \n•\nDo good and do great.\n We act with integrity and humility and respect each other and our communities to drive a sustainable business. \nOur values define our Company and serve as the driving force behind how we work together and with our customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, and communities. We also have detailed policies that support our commitment to ethical behavior and legal compliance across our Company. Through our open-door policy and culture, employees are encouraged to approach their managers if they believe violations of standards or policies have occurred and are able to make confidential and anonymous reports using a 24/7 online or telephone hotline hosted by an independent third-party provider.\nAt Deckers, we believe our culture makes us unique. We regularly conduct employee surveys to understand our employees’ experiences on a variety of topics focused on employee engagement. Our latest survey completed in February 2025 had a participation rate of 91.5%. Of those employees who completed the survey, 89% noted they were proud to work for Deckers.\nWe believe an inclusive workplace that promotes belonging for everyone brings together those with a unique set of experiences, opinions, and thoughts on critical issues. In turn, these varied perspectives enhance our business and drive better outcomes. Our people are at the center of everything we do. Their perspectives and passion for innovation enable us to build brands and create products that people around the world love. We strive to create an environment where employees can come as they are and are free to bring their authentic selves to work every day.\nWe publish workforce metrics in our annual Equal Employment Opportunity filing (EEO-1) which is publicly available at deckers.com/responsibility/policies. The content of our website, including our annual EEO-1 filing, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. \nCharitable Giving and Volunteering.\n \nOur charitable contributions, product donations, and employee volunteer efforts are an essential part of our culture. We annually contribute to our local communities through monetary donations, volunteer efforts, and in-kind donations. During fiscal year 2025, we donated over $6,000 to various non-profit organizations around the globe, primarily to organizations focused on uplifting youth, community, belonging, education, and the environment. We also continued our Art of Kindness events, where employees volunteer during a week-long event in our local communities multiple times during the fiscal year. Our employees volunteered approximately 24,000 hours during fiscal year 2025. Our strategic giving and community-engagement efforts continued to be aligned with our SDGs.\n9\nTable of \nContents\nTalent Development and Retention\n. \nThe ability to attract, develop, and retain employees is critical to our long-term success. We focus on our employees’ growth, creating experiences that align with our strategic priorities and promote inclusion, performance, connection, and opportunities for development. For example, we offer a week fully dedicated to employee learning, connection, and development across the globe (Explore Week), and three global leadership development programs for leaders at varying levels (Trailblazers, Navigator, and Ascent). Our leadership team also mentors rising talent on a formal and informal basis, which we believe accelerates the development and engagement of our top performers, increases organizational learning, and improves employee performance and retention. Further, our executive leadership team and Board commit substantial time to succession planning, evaluating the bench strength of our leadership and supporting their career development while improving organizational performance. We are proud to offer a wide range of programs intended to support global employee development and retention.\nWe have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages, and annual increases based on merit, as well as annual cash bonus compensation, which is based on Company and individual performance. We provide tuition reimbursement for eligible US employees up to $5 thousand per calendar year. Further, to foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of management with stockholders, time-based restricted stock units and long-term incentive plan performance stock units are granted to a substantial proportion of our leadership team under our stock-based compensation programs. In addition, employees across the US business have the opportunity to purchase stock at a discounted price through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Further, we engage an independent compensation consultant, FW Cook, which provides us with information to evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation program, including competitive pay practices and trends in our industry, the design and structure of our executive compensation program, and the formulation of and benchmarking against our peers within our industry.\nEmployee Wellness\n. \nWe strive to be one of the best places to work and recognize our employees are at different stages of life and have individual needs. We offer affordable, innovative, comprehensive, and competitive benefits package that range from health insurance, retirement plan, life insurance, disability, accident coverage, paid time off, paid and unpaid leave including parental leave, mental health benefits, and other voluntary benefits such as health savings accounts and our recently adopted solar and electric car reimbursement program. \nEmployee Health and Safety\n. \nThe health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. We have comprehensive safety training programs to help ensure our employees know how to do their jobs safely and in compliance with laws and regulations. We prioritize the safety of our facilities and work to ensure they are modern and efficient.\nSEASONALITY\nA significant part of the UGG brand’s business has historically been seasonal, with the highest percentage of net sales occurring in the third fiscal quarter, which has contributed to variation in results of operations from quarter to quarter. However, we have mitigated the impacts of seasonality by diversifying and expanding product offerings with additional year-round styles. In addition, as the HOKA brand’s net sales, which generally occur more evenly throughout the fiscal year, continue to increase as a percentage of our aggregate net sales, we expect to reduce the impacts of seasonality in future periods.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report for further discussion of the impacts of seasonality and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nCOMPETITION\nThe industry and markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our competitors include athletic footwear companies, branded apparel companies, and retailers with their own private labels. Although the industry is fragmented, many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources, several of which compete directly with some of our products. In addition, access to offshore manufacturing and the growth of e-commerce has made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear, apparel, and accessories industry. In particular, and in part due to the popularity of our UGG brand and HOKA brand products, we face increasing competition from a significant number of domestic and international \n10\nTable of \nContents\ncompetitors selling products designed to compete directly or indirectly with our products. We believe our ability to successfully compete depends on numerous factors, including our ability to predict, assess, and respond quickly to changing consumer tastes and preferences, produce appealing products that meet expectations for product quality and technical performance, maintain and enhance the image and strength of our brands, price our products competitively, and weather the impacts of supply chain disruptions, among others. In addition, we believe our key customers face intense competition from other department stores, sporting goods stores, retail specialty stores, and online retailers, among others, which could negatively impact the financial stability of their businesses and their ability to conduct business with us. \nRefer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and results of operations.\nTRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\nWe utilize trademarks for virtually all our products, and we believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our products, promoting our brands, and distinguishing our products from the products of others. We currently hold trademark registrations for “UGG,” “HOKA,” “Teva,” “AHNU,” “Koolaburra by UGG,” and other marks in the US, and for certain of the marks in many other countries, including Canada, China, the United Kingdom (UK), various countries in the European Union (EU), Japan, and Korea. As of March 31, 2025, we hold 232 designs and inventions with corresponding design or utility patent registrations, plus 64 designs and inventions which are currently pending registration. These patents expire at various times. We regard our proprietary rights as valuable assets and vigorously protect such rights against infringement by third parties.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, including US federal, state, and local laws; the laws of jurisdictions where we operate or plan to operate; and the laws of jurisdictions from which we source our products. Based on the information and circumstances known to us at this time, compliance with such applicable laws and regulations is not expected to have any material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or competitive position. \nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and information statements (and any amendments or supplements to the foregoing) filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act are available free of charge on our website at \nir.deckers.com\n. Such documents and information are available as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. We also make certain corporate governance and responsibility documents available through our website at \nir.deckers.com/governance\n and \nir.deckers.com/responsibility/policies\n, respectively, including Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct, Audit & Risk Management Committee Charter, Talent & Compensation Committee Charter, Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability, & Governance Committee Charter, Code of Ethics, Creating Change Report, Accounting and Finance Code of Ethics, EEO-1 Report, and Corporate Governance Guidelines.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report. This discussion includes an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023 and year-over-year comparisons between those periods.\nCertain statements made in this section constitute “forward-looking statements,” which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth in the section titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all figures herein are expressed in thousands, except for per share and share data. \nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: UGG, HOKA, Teva, AHNU, and Koolaburra. Our brands compete across the fashion and casual lifestyle, performance, running, and outdoor markets. We believe our products are distinctive and appeal to a broad demographic. Our brands sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to global consumers through our DTC channel, which is comprised of an e‑commerce and retail store presence. We seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize fashion, authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups.

We closed Koolaburra.com as of March 31, 2025, and plan to wind down the Koolaburra brand in the wholesale channel by the end of calendar year 2025. Refer to the section titled “The Company,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information.\nSanuk Brand Asset Sale.\n During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we completed the sale of the Sanuk brand and certain related assets. Refer to the section below titled “Reportable Operating Segment Overview” for further information on our results of operations. Refer to the section titled “The Company,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on the sale of the Sanuk brand. \nForward Stock Split and Authorized Share Increase.\n On September 13, 2024, we effected a stock split and an authorized share increase. Our financial results included within this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effectiveness of the stock split and the authorized share increase. Refer to the section titled “Basis of Presentation,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe expect our business and industry will continue to be impacted by several important trends and uncertainties, including the following: \nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Factors\n•\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from evolving US trade policy that has introduced uncertainty and volatility in global trade relations, including higher tariffs and greater restrictions on goods imported from certain regions. While we pursue mitigation strategies, including through selective, staggered, and strategic price increases on our products sold in the US and by negotiating cost-sharing arrangements with our independent manufacturers, we may be unable to offset all resulting \n32\nTable of \nContents\nincreases to our cost of goods sold. These risks may have a material adverse impact on demand for our products. \n•\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressures, increased tariffs, geopolitical unrest, and escalating global conflicts, are creating a complex and challenging environment for our business and industry. While these factors did not materially impact our business or results of operations during fiscal year 2025, the full impact of these factors is difficult to quantify and could negatively impact us in future periods.\nBrand and Omni-Channel Strategy \n•\nWe remain focused on increasing global consumer awareness and adoption of our brands, which has continued to positively impact our financial results. Our efforts to drive brand adoption are focused on building brand acceptance and heat through launches of innovative product offerings, coupled with marketing investments across multiple geographic markets and channels of distribution, including strategic expansion of the global marketplace.\n•\nWe continue to implement a marketplace inventory management strategy for our brands through segmentation and differentiation. During fiscal year 2025, we continued to experience alignment on product assortments that resulted in higher full-price sell-through, which benefited our gross margins across all channels of distribution. While gross margins continue to be an area of strategic focus, we may not experience these benefits to our gross margins in our fiscal year ending March 31, 2026 (next fiscal year) due to various factors, including impacts from macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, discussed above, as well as potential impacts from our pricing strategies.   \n•\nOur long-term strategy remains focused on building our DTC channel to represent an increased proportion of our total net sales, which includes differentiating the consumer experience from the wholesale channel to drive increases in acquisition and retention to sustain strong market positions and a high level of demand for our brands. We expect increased sales in the DTC channel will continue to positively impact our gross margins. However, as we expand doors with wholesale partners to drive brand awareness and market share in the near-term, our wholesale channel may represent a higher portion of our total net sales in certain periods, which could pressure our margins in those periods.\n•\nWe continue to implement our international growth strategies for the HOKA and UGG brands to represent an increased proportion of our total net sales. We continue to selectively expand our HOKA brand presence through additional locations with our wholesale partners and targeted retail store expansion within our DTC channel. We also continue to invest in certain regions that provide influential market presence to build HOKA brand awareness, and we expect to continue making these investments, including in our next fiscal year. We continue to emphasize elevating the customer experience for our brands through category expansion and collaborations.\nSupply Chain \n•\nTo support our growing business, we continue to invest in our network of global warehouses, DCs, and 3PLs, which have fixed and variable costs, with variable costs changing relative to changes in net sales. We continue to diversify our third-party manufacturers and the regions in which they operate. We are currently negotiating the transition of one of our international 3PLs to a new partner with an upgraded warehouse management system during our next fiscal year. We expect to continue to invest in and build upon these infrastructure capabilities to continue meeting customer and consumer demand.\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS OVERVIEW\nAs of March 31, 2025, our three reportable operating segments include the worldwide operations of the UGG brand, HOKA brand, and Other brands. Information reported to the CODM, who is our Principal Executive Officer (PEO), is organized into these reportable operating segments and is consistent with how the CODM evaluates our performance and allocates resources. \n33\nTable of \nContents\nChange in Reportable Operating Segments. \nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the financial information regularly used by the CODM to evaluate performance, make operating decisions, and allocate resources was revised. In connection with executive leadership alignment, and the recent divestiture and phase out of certain brands, the CODM shifted resource allocation decisions and performance assessment to a brand focus, rather than a distribution channel focus. This resulted in a change in our reportable operating segments. The change in reportable operating segments had an impact on segment income from operations, a measure of segment profitability, and we clarified unallocated overhead costs excluded from this measure as unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses. Unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses are costs that are managed centrally and not specific to any one brand. These costs are primarily comprised of certain payroll and related expenses, including stock-based compensation; global IT expenses; 3PL service fees; depreciation, rent, and occupancy for owned warehouses and offices; and other SG&A expenses, such as costs for contract services, materials, supplies, and travel. These costs span multiple functions including owned warehouses and 3PL service fees, along with enterprise costs which include centralized commercial operations, IT, finance, human resources, legal, supply chain, and corporate executives. \nPreviously, our six reportable operating segments included the worldwide wholesale operations of the UGG brand, HOKA brand, Teva brand, Sanuk brand, and Other brands (primarily the AHNU brand and Koolaburra brand), and DTC. Reportable operating segment results for all prior periods presented in this Annual Report have been recast to reflect the change in reportable operating segments.\nAs discussed under the section titled “Recent Developments” above, the sale of the Sanuk brand was completed during fiscal year 2025. The financial results for our reportable operating segments present the former Sanuk brand within the Other brands reportable operating segment through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date for the year ended March 31, 2025, and full financial results for the years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023. \nRefer to Note 12, “Reportable Operating Segments,” \nof our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report \nfor further information on reportable operating segments. \nUGG Brand.\n \nThe UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized footwear brands in our industry, which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient consumer-focused line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories with year-round product offerings that appeal to a growing global audience and a broad demographic.\nWe believe demand for UGG brand products will continue to be driven by the following:\n•\nSuccessful acquisition of a diverse global consumer base, and in particular focusing on key markets, through strategic marketing activations and collaborations that resonate with a fashionable consumer. \n•\nHigh consumer brand loyalty due to elevated brand experiences and consistent delivery of crafted; purposefully built and luxuriously comfortable footwear, apparel, and accessories. \n•\nDiversification of our footwear product offerings, such as our spring and summer lines, as well as expanded category offerings for Men’s products such as the slip-on shoe and sneaker category, and more iconic fashion product for our Classics line, including reimagining existing iconic styles into new categories. \n•\nThoughtful expansion of our apparel and accessories businesses.\nHOKA Brand\n. \nThe HOKA brand is an authentic premium line of year-round performance footwear, which offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight. Originally designed for ultra-runners, the brand now appeals to world champions, taste makers, and everyday athletes. Expanded marketing and strategic marketplace presence have fueled both domestic and international sales growth of the HOKA brand, which has quickly become a leading brand within run and outdoor specialty wholesale accounts and is growing across its global marketplace. The HOKA brand’s product line includes running, trail, hiking, fitness, and lifestyle footwear offerings, as well as select apparel and accessories.\n34\nTable of \nContents\nWe believe demand for HOKA brand products will continue to be driven by the following: \n•\nLeading performance product innovation, category extensions, and key franchise management, including higher frequency product drop rates and improving accessibility to all athletes.\n•\nIncreased global brand awareness and new consumer adoption through enhanced global marketing activations and online consumer acquisition, including building a more diverse outdoor community through digital and in-person event sponsorship.\n•\nThoughtful and strategic distribution choices, allowing the HOKA brand access and introduction to a broader, more diverse, consumer base.\n•\nCategory extensions in authentic performance footwear offerings such as lifestyle, trail, and fitness categories.\nOther Brands.\n Other brands consist primarily of the Teva brand, AHNU brand, and Koolaburra brand. The Teva brand’s products are built for a range of outdoor pursuits and include a variety of footwear options, from classic sandals and shoes to boots. The AHNU brand’s footwear products fuse high-performance technology with timeless style crafted for everyday wear. The Koolaburra brand, for which we are phasing out standalone operations by the end of calendar year 2025, is a casual footwear brand that uses plush materials to target value-oriented consumers.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe disclose supplemental financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP); however, throughout this \nAnnual Report\n we provide certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis (non-GAAP financial measures). \nWe provide \nnon-GAAP financial measures\n to provide information that may assist investors in understanding our results of operations and assessing our prospects for future performance, which consist of constant currency measures. We believe evaluating certain financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis is important as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not indicative of our core results of operations and are largely outside of our control. However, o\nur non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be considered more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of financial or operating performance as determined in accordance with US GAAP. \nWe calculate our constant cur\nrency non-GAAP financial measures for current period financial information, such as total net sales using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period, excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate hedges and remeasurements in the \nconsolidated financial statements\n. We also report comparable DTC sales on a constant currency basis for DTC operations that were open throughout the current and prior reporting periods, and we may adjust prior reporting periods to conform to current year accounting policies. T\nhe information presented on a constant currency basis, as we present such information, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled information presented by other companies, and may not be appropriate measures for comparing our performance relative to other companies. Constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to US dollar measures that reflect current period foreign currency exchange rates or to other financial or operating measures presented in accordance with \nUS GAAP\n.\nSEASONALITY\nA significant part of the UGG brand’s business has historically been seasonal, with the highest percentage of net sales occurring in the third fiscal quarter, which has contributed to variation in results of operations from quarter to quarter. However, we have mitigated the impacts of seasonality by diversifying and expanding product offerings with additional year-round styles. In addition, as the HOKA brand’s net sales, which generally occur more evenly throughout the fiscal year, continue to increase as a percentage of our aggregate net sales, we expect to reduce the impacts of seasonality in future periods. \n35\nTable of \nContents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended March 31, 2025, Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2024. \nResults of operations were as follows:\n \nYears Ended March 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nNet sales\n$\n4,985,612\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n4,287,763\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n697,849\n \n16.3\n \n%\nCost of sales\n2,099,949 \n42.1 \n1,902,275 \n44.4 \n(197,674)\n(10.4)\nGross profit\n2,885,663\n \n57.9\n \n2,385,488\n \n55.6\n \n500,175\n \n21.0\n \nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n1,706,571 \n34.3 \n1,457,974 \n34.0 \n(248,597)\n(17.1)\nIncome from operations\n1,179,092\n \n23.6\n \n927,514\n \n21.6\n \n251,578\n \n27.1\n \nTotal other income, net\n(64,207)\n(1.3)\n(51,427)\n(1.2)\n12,780 \n24.9 \nIncome before income taxes\n1,243,299\n \n24.9\n \n978,941\n \n22.8\n \n264,358\n \n27.0\n \nIncome tax expense\n277,208 \n5.5 \n219,378 \n5.1 \n(57,830)\n(26.4)\nNet income\n966,091\n \n19.4\n \n759,563\n \n17.7\n \n206,528\n \n27.2\n \nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\n1,079 \n— \n(11,698)\n(0.3)\n12,777 \n109.2 \nComprehensive income\n$\n967,170\n \n19.4\n \n%\n$\n747,865\n \n17.4\n \n%\n$\n219,305\n \n29.3\n \n%\nNet income per share\nBasic\n$\n6.36 \n$\n4.89 \n$\n1.47 \n30.1 \n%\nDiluted\n$\n6.33 \n$\n4.86 \n$\n1.47 \n30.2 \n%\nNet Sales.\n \nNet sales by brand, channel, and geography were as follows:\n \nYears Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nNet sales by brand\n \n \n \n \nUGG brand\n \n \n \n \nWholesale\n$\n1,282,319 \n$\n1,115,241 \n$\n167,078 \n15.0 \n%\nDirect-to-Consumer\n1,249,032 \n1,123,891 \n125,141 \n11.1 \nTotal\n2,531,351 \n2,239,132 \n292,219 \n13.1 \nHOKA brand\nWholesale\n1,397,776 \n1,126,126 \n271,650 \n24.1 \nDirect-to-Consumer\n835,314 \n680,614 \n154,700 \n22.7 \nTotal\n2,233,090 \n1,806,740 \n426,350 \n23.6 \nOther brands \n(1) (2)\n \n \n \n \nWholesale\n175,770 \n190,940 \n(15,170)\n(7.9)\nDirect-to-Consumer\n45,401 \n50,951 \n(5,550)\n(10.9)\nTotal\n221,171 \n241,891 \n(20,720)\n(8.6)\nTotal \n(1)\n$\n4,985,612\n \n$\n4,287,763\n \n$\n697,849\n \n16.3\n \n%\nNet sales by channel\nTotal Wholesale\n$\n2,855,865 \n$\n2,432,307 \n$\n423,558 \n17.4 \n%\nTotal Direct-to-Consumer\n2,129,747 \n1,855,456 \n274,291 \n14.8 \nTotal \n(1)\n$\n4,985,612\n \n$\n4,287,763\n \n$\n697,849\n \n16.3\n \n%\n36\nTable of \nContents\n \nYears Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nNet sales by geography\nDomestic\n$\n3,186,709 \n$\n2,863,674 \n$\n323,035 \n11.3 \n%\nInternational\n1,798,903 \n1,424,089 \n374,814 \n26.3 \nTotal \n(1)\n$\n4,985,612\n \n$\n4,287,763\n \n$\n697,849\n \n16.3\n \n%\n(1)\n Includes Sanuk brand partial financial results through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date of August 15, 2024, for the year ended March 31, 2025, and full financial results for the prior period, which are presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment.

Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments Overview” above for further information on the recent change in our reportable operating segments.\nTotal net sales increased primarily due to higher global net sales across all channels for the HOKA and UGG brands, partially offset by lower US net sales for Other brands across all channels. Drivers of significant changes in net sales, compared to the prior period, were as follows: \n•\nNet sales of the HOKA brand increased due to higher global demand for an assortment of performance products across all channels. HOKA brand wholesale channel growth was driven primarily by global market share gains and benefits from new points of distribution with key partners. HOKA brand DTC channel growth was driven primarily by global gains in consumer acquisition and retention. \n•\nNet sales of the UGG brand increased due to higher global demand across both channels, especially internationally. UGG brand wholesale channel growth was primarily driven by demand for year-round key product franchises and strong partnerships with brand-enhancing retailers. UGG brand DTC channel growth was primarily driven by global gains in consumer acquisition and retention.\n•\nNet sales of the Other brands decreased primarily due to lower US net sales across all channels, including impacts from the sale of the Sanuk brand.\nSupplemental Disclosure\n•\nOn a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 16.5%, compared to the prior period.\n•\nComparable DTC channel net sales for the 52 weeks ended March 30, 2025, increased by 13.4% compared to the prior period.\n•\nWe experienced an increase of 13.5% in the total volume of units sold to 74,100 from 65,300,\n \ncompared to the prior period. Units sold include all categories such as footwear, apparel, accessories, home goods, and care kits.\nGross Profit.\n \nGross margin increased to 57.9% from 55.6%, compared to the prior period, primarily due to favorable brand and product mix, with higher margin product driving a higher proportion of growth, and increased levels of full-price selling primarily for the UGG brand, including reduced closeouts to the wholesale channel, partially offset by unfavorable changes in freight costs.\n37\nTable of \nContents\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\n \nDrivers of significant net changes in SG&A expenses, compared to the prior period, were as follows:\n•\nIncreased advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses of approximately $83,300, primarily due to higher promotional marketing expenses for the HOKA and UGG brands to drive global brand awareness and market share gains, highlight new product categories, and provide localized marketing.\n•\nIncreased other SG&A expenses of approximately $79,800, primarily due to higher unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses of approximately $46,400 for 3PL service fees, contract services, IT programming and software costs, and other operating expenses; higher HOKA brand expenses of approximately $22,700 for materials and supplies, sales commissions, travel costs, bad debt expenses, credit card fees, and other operating expenses; and higher UGG brand expenses of approximately $9,700 for sales commissions, bad debt expenses, and credit card fees.\n•\nIncreased payroll and related costs of approximately $67,800, primarily due to higher headcount from investments in talent for the HOKA brand, enterprise functions, and the UGG brand, along with higher variable payroll costs to support higher sales.\n•\nIncreased depreciation and other related costs of approximately $10,800, primarily due to higher unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses for infrastructure investments and related depreciation, partially offset by lower impairments.\n•\nIncreased rent and occupancy of approximately $8,800, primarily due to higher rent expenses resulting from retail store footprint expansion for the HOKA brand.\n•\nIncreased net foreign currency-related remeasurement gains of approximately $2,000, primarily due to favorable changes in Asian exchange rates against the US dollar.\nIncome from Operations. \nIncome (loss) from operations by reportable operating segment was as follows:\nYears Ended March 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nIncome (loss) from operations\nUGG brand\n$\n1,002,873 \n$\n804,827 \n$\n198,046 \n24.6 \n%\nHOKA brand\n848,505 \n719,047 \n129,458 \n18.0 \nOther brands \n(1) (2)\n34,578 \n23,721 \n10,857 \n45.8 \nUnallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses \n(3)\n(706,864)\n(620,081)\n(86,783)\n(14.0)\nTotal\n$\n1,179,092\n \n$\n927,514\n \n$\n251,578\n \n27.1\n \n%\n(1)\n Includes Sanuk brand partial financial results through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date of August 15, 2024, for the year ended March 31, 2025, and full financial results for the prior period, which are presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment.

The change in reportable operating segments had an impact on segment income from operations, a measure of segment profitability, and a clarification was made that certain prior unallocated overhead costs are defined as unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability. \n38\nTable of \nContents\nThe increase in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. \nDrivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, were as follows:\n•\nThe increase in income from operations of the UGG brand was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, as well as relatively flat SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.\n•\nThe increase in income from operations of the HOKA brand was due to higher net sales at slightly lower gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, primarily reflecting increased marketing and headcount to support brand growth initiatives.\n•\nThe increase in income from operations of the Other brands was due to higher gross margins on lower net sales, as well as the benefit to SG&A expenses from lower impairments compared to the prior period for the Sanuk brand definite-lived intangible assets.\n•\nThe increase in unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses was due to higher other SG&A expenses for 3PL service fees, contract services, and IT programming and software costs; higher payroll and related costs for higher variable payroll costs along with higher headcount for enterprise functions; and higher depreciation and other related costs for infrastructure investments.\nTotal Other Income, Net. \nThe increase in total other income, net, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher interest income from higher invested cash balances.\nIncome Tax Expense. \nIncome tax expense and our effective income tax rate were as follows:\nYears Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nIncome tax expense\n$\n277,208\n$\n219,378\nEffective income tax rate\n22.3 \n%\n22.4 \n%\nThe net decrease in our effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to benefits related to US tax on foreign earnings (including global intangible low-tax income and foreign derived intangible income), partially offset by higher income tax expense from changes in jurisdictional mix of worldwide income before income taxes and a lower benefit from net discrete items, including from return-to-provision adjustments and a valuation allowance on tax attributes.\nNet Income.\n \nThe increase in net income, compared to the prior period, was due to higher net sales and higher operating margins. Net income per share increased, compared to the prior period, due to higher net income and lower weighted-average common shares outstanding driven by stock repurchases. \nTotal Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax.\n The increase in total other comprehensive income, net of tax, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher foreign currency translation gains relating to changes in the net asset position against Asian foreign currency exchange rates.\n39\nTable of \nContents\nYear Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2023. \nResults of operations were as follows:\n \nYears Ended March 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nNet sales\n$\n4,287,763\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n3,627,286\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n660,477\n \n18.2\n \n%\nCost of sales\n1,902,275 \n44.4 \n1,801,916 \n49.7 \n(100,359)\n(5.6)\nGross profit\n2,385,488\n \n55.6\n \n1,825,370\n \n50.3\n \n560,118\n \n30.7\n \nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n1,457,974 \n34.0 \n1,172,619 \n32.3 \n(285,355)\n(24.3)\nIncome from operations\n927,514\n \n21.6\n \n652,751\n \n18.0\n \n274,763\n \n42.1\n \nTotal other income, net\n(51,427)\n(1.2)\n(13,331)\n(0.4)\n38,096 \n285.8 \nIncome before income taxes\n978,941\n \n22.8\n \n666,082\n \n18.4\n \n312,859\n \n47.0\n \nIncome tax expense\n219,378 \n5.1 \n149,260 \n4.1 \n(70,118)\n(47.0)\nNet income\n759,563\n \n17.7\n \n516,822\n \n14.3\n \n242,741\n \n47.0\n \nTotal other comprehensive loss, net of tax\n(11,698)\n(0.3)\n(14,080)\n(0.4)\n2,382 \n16.9 \nComprehensive income\n$\n747,865\n \n17.4\n \n%\n$\n502,742\n \n13.9\n \n%\n$\n245,123\n \n48.8\n \n%\nNet income per share\nBasic\n$\n4.89 \n$\n3.25 \n$\n1.64 \n50.6 \n%\nDiluted\n$\n4.86 \n$\n3.23 \n$\n1.63 \n50.5 \n%\nNet Sales.\n \nNet sales by brand, channel, and geography were as follows:\n \nYears Ended March 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nNet sales by brand\n \n \n \n \nUGG brand\n \n \n \n \nWholesale\n$\n1,115,241 \n$\n1,004,356 \n$\n110,885 \n11.0 \n%\nDirect-to-Consumer\n1,123,891 \n924,855 \n199,036 \n21.5 \nTotal\n2,239,132 \n1,929,211 \n309,921 \n16.1 \nHOKA brand\nWholesale\n1,126,126 \n925,877 \n200,249 \n21.6 \nDirect-to-Consumer\n680,614 \n487,039 \n193,575 \n39.7 \nTotal\n1,806,740 \n1,412,916 \n393,824 \n27.9 \nOther brands \n(1)\n \n \n \n \nWholesale\n190,940 \n230,442 \n(39,502)\n(17.1)\nDirect-to-Consumer\n50,951 \n54,717 \n(3,766)\n(6.9)\nTotal\n$\n241,891 \n285,159 \n(43,268)\n(15.2)\nTotal \n(1)\n$\n4,287,763\n \n$\n3,627,286\n \n$\n660,477\n \n18.2\n \n%\nNet sales by channel\nTotal Wholesale\n$\n2,432,307 \n$\n2,160,675 \n$\n271,632 \n12.6 \n%\nTotal Direct-to-Consumer\n1,855,456 \n1,466,611 \n388,845 \n26.5 \nTotal \n(1)\n$\n4,287,763\n \n$\n3,627,286\n \n$\n660,477\n \n18.2\n \n%\nNet sales by geography\nDomestic\n$\n2,863,674 \n$\n2,451,497 \n$\n412,177 \n16.8 \n%\nInternational\n1,424,089 \n1,175,789 \n248,300 \n21.1 \nTotal \n(1)\n$\n4,287,763\n \n$\n3,627,286\n \n$\n660,477\n \n18.2\n \n%\n40\nTable of \nContents\n(1)\n Includes Teva and Sanuk brand’s full financial results for the years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, which are presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments Overview,” above for further information on the recent change in our reportable operating segments.\nTotal net sales increased primarily due to higher global net sales across all channels for the HOKA and UGG brands, partially offset by lower net sales for Other brands across all channels. Drivers of significant changes in net sales, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, were as follows: \n•\nNet sales of the HOKA brand increased due to higher demand for an assortment of performance products across all channels. HOKA brand wholesale channel growth was driven primarily by market share gains in the US and Asia, partially offset by lower net sales in Europe, primarily related to the timing of certain distributor shipments. HOKA brand DTC channel growth was driven primarily by global gains in consumer acquisition and retention online. \n•\nNet sales of the UGG brand increased due to strong global adoption of key product franchises, as well as benefits from a higher level of full price selling and selective price increases on popular styles, across all channels.\n•\nNet sales of the Other brands decreased primarily due to lower demand in the wholesale channel globally for the Teva brand related to pressures on the value-oriented consumer in the sandal category and shipping timing differences, as well as in the US for the Sanuk brand due to lower consumer demand and elevated marketplace inventory levels. \nSupplemental Disclosure\n•\nOn a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 17.9%, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023.\n•\nComparable DTC channel net sales for the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2024, increased by 25.4% compared to the year ended March 31, 2023.\n•\nWe experienced an increase of 2.8% in the total volume of units sold to 65,300 from 63,500,\n \ncompared to the year ended March 31, 2023. Units sold include all categories such as footwear, apparel, accessories, home goods, and care kits.\nGross Profit.\n \nGross margin increased to 55.6% from 50.3%, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to favorable full-price selling for the UGG brand, favorable changes in freight costs, favorable HOKA brand mix and UGG brand product mix shifts, including benefits from selective price increases, and favorable mix of sales in the DTC channel.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\n \nDrivers of significant net changes in SG&A expenses, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, were as follows:\n•\nIncreased payroll and related costs of approximately $107,500, primarily due to higher headcount from investments in talent, including for the UGG and HOKA brands as well as enterprise functions, along with higher variable payroll costs to support higher sales, including performance-based compensation.\n•\nIncreased advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses of approximately $77,700, primarily due to higher promotional marketing expenses for the HOKA and UGG brands to drive global brand awareness and market share gains, highlight new product categories, and provide localized marketing.\n•\nIncreased other SG&A expenses of approximately $65,500, primarily due to higher unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses of approximately $46,700 for IT expenses for programming and software costs, 3PL service fees, legal fees, contract services, travel costs, and other operating expenses, and higher HOKA brand expenses of approximately $14,400 for credit card fees and travel costs. \n41\nTable of \nContents\n•\nIncreased rent and occupancy of approximately $21,400, primarily due to higher rent expenses resulting from retail store footprint expansion for the HOKA brand, as well as from UGG brand retail stores and enterprise offices.\n•\nIncreased depreciation and other related costs of approximately $16,100, primarily due to higher unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses for infrastructure investments and related depreciation, as well as an impairment for Sanuk brand definite-lived intangible assets. \n•\nDecreased net foreign currency-related remeasurement losses of approximately $2,900, primarily due to favorable changes in Canadian and Asian exchange rates against the US dollar.\nIncome from Operations. \nIncome (loss) from operations by reportable operating segment was as follows:\nYears Ended March 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nIncome (loss) from operations\nUGG brand\n$\n804,827 \n$\n572,469 \n$\n232,358 \n40.6 \n%\nHOKA brand\n719,047 \n528,458 \n190,589 \n36.1 \nOther brands \n(1)\n23,721 \n49,502 \n(25,781)\n(52.1)\nUnallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses \n(2)\n(620,081)\n(497,678)\n(122,403)\n(24.6)\nTotal\n$\n927,514\n \n$\n652,751\n \n$\n274,763\n \n42.1\n \n%\n(1)\n Includes Teva and Sanuk brand’s full financial results for the years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, which are presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment.

The current year income tax rate is primarily driven by US domestic taxes resulting from an increase in US domestic pre-tax income, offset by the foreign rate differential. The rate for the year ended March 31, 2023, was primarily driven by the impact on the foreign rate differential of nonrecurring income tax benefits related to foreign tax-exempt income, offset by an increase in income tax expense for lower unrealized tax benefits related to foreign tax authority assessments.\nNet Income.\n \nThe increase in net income, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to higher net sales, operating margins, and interest income. Net income per share increased, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, due to higher net income and lower weighted-average common shares outstanding driven by stock repurchases. \nTotal Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax.\n The decrease in total other comprehensive loss, net of tax, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to lower foreign currency translation losses relating to changes in the net asset position against European foreign currency exchange rates. \nLIQUIDITY\nOur liquidity may be impacted by a number of factors, including our results of operations, the strength of our brands and market acceptance of our products, impacts of seasonality and weather conditions, our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences and tastes, the timing of capital expenditures and lease payments, our ability to collect our trade accounts receivable in a timely manner and effectively manage our inventories, our ability to manage supply chain constraints, our ability to respond to macroeconomic, geopolitical and international trade developments, and various other risks and uncertainties described in the section titled “Trends and Uncertainties Impacting our Business and Industry” above and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report. Furthermore, we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions, strategic initiatives, or capital allocation strategy, a national or global economic recession, or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue.\nIf there are unexpected material impacts on our business in future periods, we may need to raise additional cash to fund our operations or pursue our business strategy, in which case we may seek to borrow under our revolving credit facilities, seek new or modified borrowing arrangements, or sell additional debt or equity securities. The sale of convertible debt or equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and equity securities may have rights or preferences that are superior to those of our existing stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in additional debt service obligations, as well as covenants that would restrict our operations and further encumber our assets. In addition, there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, factors such as changes in consumer preferences or tastes, prolonged or severe economic recession or inflationary pressure could adversely affect our business and liquidity.\nSources of Liquidity.\n We finance our working capital and operating requirements using a combination of cash and cash equivalents balances, including cash from our repatriation strategy, and cash provided from ongoing operating activities. We also have available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Refer to the section titled “Cash Flows” below for further discussion on cash flows from ongoing operating activities. \nCash and Cash Equivalents. \nAs of March 31, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents balance is $1,889,188, the majority of which is held in highly rated money market funds and interest-bearing bank deposit accounts with established national and global financial institutions. We believe our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash provided by operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, will provide \n43\nTable of \nContents\nsufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months and will be sufficient to allow us to pursue our business strategies and plans. However, there can be no assurance that sufficient capital will continue to be available or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us. \nRepatriation of Cash.\n Our cash repatriation strategy, and by extension, our liquidity, may be impacted by several additional considerations, which include future changes to or interpretations of global tax law and regulations, and our actual earnings in future periods. During the year ended March 31, 2025, no cash and cash equivalents were repatriated from a foreign subsidiary that were subject to income taxes, compared to $250,000 of cash and cash equivalents repatriated during the year ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, and 2024, we have $481,836 and $263,820, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries, a portion of which may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes if it were to be repatriated. We continue to evaluate our cash repatriation strategy and currently anticipate repatriating current and future unremitted earnings of non-US subsidiaries to the extent they have been subject to US income tax, if such cash is not required to fund ongoing foreign operations. Refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information regarding our cash repatriation strategy.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we did not generate significant pre-tax earnings from any countries which do not impose a corporate income tax. A small portion of our unremitted accumulated earnings of non-US subsidiaries, for which no US federal or state income tax have been paid, are currently expected to be reinvested outside of the US indefinitely. Such earnings would become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries.\nRevolving Credit Facilities. \nInformation about our revolving credit facilities available as of March 31, 2025, is as follows:\n•\nPrimary Credit Facility.\n \nWe have a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to $400,000 (Primary Credit Facility) and contains a $25,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Under the Primary Credit Facility, there is no outstanding balance, $399,045 of available borrowings, and $955 of outstanding letters of credit.\n•\nChina Credit Facility. \nWe have an uncommitted revolving line of credit of up to CNY300,000, or $41,338, with an overdraft facility sublimit of CNY100,000, or $13,779 (China Credit Facility). There is no outstanding balance, outstanding bank guarantees of $455, and available borrowings of $40,883 under the China Credit Facility.\n•\nDebt Covenants.\n \nWe are in compliance with all financial covenants under our Primary Credit Facility and China Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 6, “Revolving Credit Facilities,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on the terms of our revolving credit facilities. \nMaterial Cash Requirements\n.\n Our material cash requirements include working capital, payments to fulfill contractual obligations, capital expenditures, and stock repurchases. Our working capital requirements begin when we purchase raw and other materials and inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting trade accounts receivable. Given the historical seasonality of the UGG brand, our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout our fiscal year, and we utilize available cash to build inventory levels during certain quarters to support higher selling seasons. While the impact of seasonality has been mitigated to some extent, we expect our working capital requirements will continue to fluctuate from period to period. \n44\nTable of \nContents\nContractual Obligations.\n \nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of March 31, 2025, in future periods:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 Year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nMore than\n5 Years\nOperating lease obligations \n(1)\n$\n317,823 \n$\n62,445 \n$\n123,491 \n$\n71,557 \n$\n60,330 \nPurchase obligations for product \n(2)\n956,911 \n956,911 \n— \n— \n— \nPurchase obligations for commodities \n(3)\n231,323 \n7,412 \n223,911 \n— \n— \nOther purchase obligations\n (4)\n200,744 \n118,336 \n70,274 \n12,134 \n— \nNet unrecognized tax benefits \n(5)\n4,904 \n1,955 \n2,949 \n— \n— \nTotal\n$\n1,711,705\n \n$\n1,147,059\n \n$\n420,625\n \n$\n83,691\n \n$\n60,330\n \n(1)\n Our operating lease obligations consist primarily of building leases for our retail locations, warehouses and DCs, and regional offices, and include the undiscounted cash lease payments owed under the terms of the lease agreements. In addition to the above operating lease obligations recorded on a discounted basis in our consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2025, there is an aggregate of $10,096 of undiscounted minimum lease payments due pursuant to leases signed, but not yet commenced, primarily for new HOKA brand retail stores and a regional office, for which the leases are expected to commence in the first quarter of our next fiscal year. \n(2) \nOur purchase obligations for product consist mostly of open purchase orders that we expect to fulfill in the ordinary course of business. Outstanding purchase orders are primarily issued to our independent manufacturers and are typically expected to be paid in less than one fiscal year. We can cancel a significant portion of the purchase obligations under certain circumstances; however, the occurrence of such circumstances is generally limited. As a result, the reported amount does not necessarily reflect the dollar amount of our binding commitments or minimum purchase obligations and instead reflects an estimate of our future payment commitments based on information currently available. \n(3) \nOur purchase obligations for commodities represent remaining commitments under existing supply agreements, which are subject to minimum volume commitments (collectively, commodity contracts). We typically enter into commodity contracts for sheepskin and sugarcane-derived EVA. We expect purchases under commodity contracts in the ordinary course of business will eventually exceed the minimum commitment levels. The reported amount generally reflects remaining minimum commitments we expect will be consumed in future periods in the ordinary course of business, and any remaining deposits expected to become fully refundable or to be reflected as a credit against future purchases which are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. There are no deposits included in the amount above that have not been fully consumed as of March 31, 2025.\n(4) \nOur other purchase obligations consist of non-cancellable minimum commitments for IT services, 3PL service fees and other supply chain services, promotional expenses, and other commitments under service contracts. These amounts exclude capital expenditures expected to be made in the next fiscal year, which are further discussed below. \n(5)\n Net unrecognized tax benefits are gross unrecognized tax benefits, less federal benefit for state income taxes, related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized. As of March 31, 2025, the timing of future cash outflows is highly uncertain related to expirations of statute of limitations of\n \n$15,288 and, since we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement, it is excluded from the table above. Refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our uncertain tax positions.\nRefer to Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our operating leases, purchase obligations, and other contractual obligations and commitments.\nCapital Expenditures. \nWe estimate capital expenditures that will be made before the end of our next fiscal year will range from approximately $120,000 to $130,000. We anticipate these expenditures will primarily relate to expanding our HOKA brand retail store fleet, refreshes to our existing retail store fleet, IT infrastructure and system improvements, as well as upgrading our existing warehouses and DCs, and office facilities. However, the actual amount of our future capital expenditures may differ significantly from this estimate depending on numerous factors, including the timing of facility and retail store openings, as well as unforeseen needs to replace or refresh existing assets.\n45\nTable of \nContents\nStock Repurchase Program\n.\n \nWe continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy and consider further opportunities to utilize our global cash resources in a way that will profitably grow our business, meet our strategic objectives, and drive stockholder value, including by potentially repurchasing additional shares of our common stock.\n \nAs of March 31, 2025, the aggregate remaining approved amount under our stock repurchase program is $374,701. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. \nOn May 21, 2025, our Board approved an additional authorization of $2,250,000 to repurchase shares of our common stock under the same conditions as the prior stock repurchase program.\nRefer to Note 10, “Stockholders’ Equity,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information regarding our stock repurchase program and capital allocation strategy.\nCASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes the major components of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented:\nYears Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nChange\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,044,523 \n$\n1,033,184 \n$\n11,339 \n1.1 \n%\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(75,003)\n(89,331)\n14,328 \n16.0 \nNet cash used in financing activities\n(581,334)\n(417,675)\n(163,659)\n(39.2)\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(1,049)\n(5,922)\n4,873 \n82.3 \nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n387,137\n \n$\n520,256\n \n$\n(133,119)\n(25.6)\n%\nOperating Activities. \nOur primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities, which is driven by our net income after non-cash adjustments and changes in operating assets and liabilities. \nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2025, compared to the prior period, was due to $217,349 of favorable net income after non-cash adjustments, partially offset by $206,010 of unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to (1) the impact on net trade accounts payable from timing of receipts of goods and services and respective disbursements, (2) higher purchases of inventory to support higher demand for our brands, (3) higher net trade accounts receivable on higher net sales, (4) timing of tax payments and receipts, and (5) favorable changes due to timing of derivative cash settlements.\nInvesting Activities.\n \nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2025, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to an increase in cash proceeds from the sale of assets.\nFinancing Activities.\n \nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2025, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to a higher dollar value of stock repurchases, inclusive of excise taxes. \n46\nTable of \nContents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPreparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with \nUS GAAP\n requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative accounting pronouncements, and other factors that it believes to be reasonable. In addition, management has considered the potential impact of macroeconomic factors, including changes in tariff rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rate volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in commodity pricing, changes in consumer discretionary spending, and recessionary concerns, on our business and operations. Although the full impact of these factors is unknown, management believes it has made appropriate accounting estimates and assumptions based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions, which may result in material effects on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and the balances have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates, as well as the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.\nSales Returns and Chargebacks.\n Revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns, chargebacks, and sales discounts in the period in which the related sale is recorded. Estimates for sales returns and chargebacks are based on various factors as follows: \nSales Return Liability. \nThe amounts of these reserves are determined based on several factors, including known and actual returns, historical returns, and any recent events that could result in a change from historical return rates. For our wholesale channel, we base our estimate of sales returns on any approved customer requests for returns, historical returns experience, and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates, among other factors. For our DTC channel, we estimate sales returns using a lag compared to the same prior period and consider historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns, among other factors. \nAllowance for Chargebacks\n. We record an allowance based primarily on known circumstances as well as unknown circumstances based on historical trends related to the timing and amount of chargebacks taken against customer invoices. \nThe determination of these sales liabilities and allowances is considered a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required to estimate adjustments to historical return rates and trends. Actual allowances may differ from estimates due to changes in customer, consumer, or product-specific circumstances. \nRefer to Note 2, “Revenue Recognition,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information regarding the sales return liability, allowances for chargebacks, and allowances for sales discounts. Refer to Schedule II, “Total Valuation and Qualifying Accounts,” in Part IV within this Annual Report for an analysis of the activity in our allowances for chargebacks and sales discounts. \n47\nTable of \nContents\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. \nWe provide an allowance against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers’ inability to pay. We determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged trade accounts receivable, economic conditions and forecasts, historical experience, and the customers’ creditworthiness. Changes in the characteristics of our trade accounts receivable and the aforementioned factors, among others, are reviewed quarterly and may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance involves judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade accounts receivable. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required in the future. \nRefer to Schedule II, “Total Valuation and Qualifying Accounts,” in Part IV within this Annual Report for an analysis of the activity in our allowances for doubtful accounts. \nInventories. \nInventories, which are primarily comprised of finished goods on hand and in transit, are stated at the lower of cost (weighted moving average) or net realizable value at each financial statement date. We review inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete, and impaired inventory to evaluate write-downs to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs to sell. While we believe that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the consolidated financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences may change, and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future. \nIncome Taxes\n. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.\n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. \nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover our deferred tax assets. If we determine all, or part of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, we will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nWe make estimates to determine income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions. Our estimates, relative to income tax expense, consider current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in, or our interpretation of, tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income tax expense in our results of operations.\nOur estimates related to tax benefits from uncertain tax positions consider whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position and the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Resolution of these uncertainties may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional tax charge in the period our assessment changes. \nWe determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-US operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our US and foreign subsidiaries. We have not changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion of foreign earnings other than previously taxed earnings and profits.\nRefer to Note 5, “Income Taxes,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our income taxes and tax strategy.\n48\nTable of \nContents",
