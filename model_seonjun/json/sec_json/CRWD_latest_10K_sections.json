BUSINESS\nOverview\nFounded in 2011, CrowdStrike reinvented cybersecurity for the cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers. When we started CrowdStrike, cyberattackers had an asymmetric advantage over legacy cybersecurity products that could not keep pace with rapid changes in adversary tactics. We took a fundamentally different approach to solve this problem with the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity platform – the first, true, cloud-native platform built with AI at the core, capable of harnessing vast amounts of security and enterprise data to deliver highly modular solutions through a single lightweight agent. \nThe CrowdStrike Falcon platform is designed to be the definitive platform for cybersecurity consolidation, purpose-built to stop breaches. The platform’s single, lightweight agent collects and integrates data from across the enterprise, including endpoints, cloud workloads, identities, and third-party sources. We use this to train our AI to detect and prevent threats and drive workflow automation to give security teams machine speed advantage to stop adversaries. By consolidating and replacing legacy point products and fragmented platforms across key areas of security and IT, the Falcon platform delivers a unified, modern approach that increases capabilities, reduces complexity, and lowers costs – all while stopping breaches. \nWe believe our approach has defined a new category called the Security Cloud, which has the power to transform the cybersecurity industry the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. Using cloud-scale AI, our Security Cloud enriches and correlates trillions of cybersecurity events per week with indicators of attack, threat intelligence, and enterprise data (including data from across endpoints, workloads, identities, DevOps, IT assets, and configurations) to create actionable data, identify shifts in adversary tactics, and automatically prevent threats in real-time across our customer base. The more data that is fed into our Falcon platform, the more intelligent our Security Cloud becomes, and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide.\nCrowdStrike: The Architectural Purpose Behind the Platform\nOur Falcon platform was purpose-built in the cloud to harness the power of data and AI to deliver the next generation of automated protection and provide threat hunters with the intelligence required to stop sophisticated attacks, including malware-free and fileless attacks. This approach has made CrowdStrike an industry leader in protection across endpoints, cloud workloads, identity and data (capable of protecting workloads across on-premise, virtualized, and cloud-based environments running on a variety of endpoints such as desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads, cloud containers, mobile, and IoT devices) and enables us to rapidly scale this best in class protection across new and emerging areas of enterprise risk. \nToday, we offer 29 cloud modules on our Falcon platform via a SaaS subscription-based model that spans multiple large markets, including corporate endpoint and cloud workload security, managed security services, security and vulnerability management, IT operations management, identity protection, next-generation security information and event management (“SIEM”) and log management, threat intelligence services, data protection, SaaS security posture management, Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (“SOAR”) and AI powered workflow automation, and securing generative AI workloads.\nOur Falcon platform is composed of tightly integrated, proprietary technologies that enable us to deliver superior protection and performance, while reducing complexity for our customers. Our Falcon platform consists of our easily deployed, intelligent lightweight agent, and our groundbreaking graph technology. \nOur single, lightweight-agent approach has changed how organizations experience cybersecurity, delivering protection without impacting the user, resources or productivity. With the lightweight agent installed on each endpoint and cloud workload, our Falcon platform automates detection and prevention capabilities in real time across our entire global customer base. This also enables our Falcon platform to intelligently ingest data once and stream high fidelity data back into the Security Cloud to be re-used for multiple use cases, continuously improve our Falcon platform’s AI algorithms and make its real-time decision-making faster and smarter to keep customers ahead of changing adversary tactics. \n4\nTable of \nContents\nOur graph technology correlates and contextualizes the vast data of our Security Cloud so we can collect data once and reuse it repeatedly to deliver solutions that solve our customers’ biggest problems. The highly advanced graph technologies underpinning the Falcon platform include:\n•\nOur Threat Graph, which uses a combination of AI and behavioral pattern-matching techniques to correlate and analyze trillions of cybersecurity events, enriched with threat intelligence, and third-party data to identify and link threat activity together to automatically prevent threats in real time across CrowdStrike’s global customer base. This also provides customers with increased visibility of attacks for proactive threat hunting and timely detection and remediation of novel threats. \n•\nOur Intel Graph, which analyzes and correlates data and threat intelligence to visualize the connections between adversaries and attacks to help customers prioritize investigations and gain a deep understanding of the threat landscape. The latest intel on adversaries, tactics, techniques, and procedures is delivered seamlessly within the CrowdStrike Falcon platform and is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.\n•\nOur Asset Graph, which dynamically monitors and tracks the complex interactions among assets, providing a single holistic view of the risks those assets pose. Asset Graph provides graph visualizations of the relationships among all assets such as devices, users, accounts, applications, cloud workloads and operations technology (“OT”), along with the rich context necessary for proper security hygiene and proactive security posture management to reduce risk in their organizations — without impacting IT.\nThe Falcon platform was purpose-built with the foresight that the future of cybersecurity would need to be cloud-native and AI-driven. While AI is revolutionizing many technology fields, including cybersecurity solutions, to be truly effective, algorithms that enable AI depend on the quality and volume of data that trains them and the selection of the right differentiating features from that data. \nThis is why we believe our Security Cloud and our cloud-native architecture creates a fundamental differentiator from our competitors. The expansive amount of high fidelity data crowdsourced and captured in our Security Cloud enables the continuous training of our algorithms. We call this cloud-scale AI. Our technology is uniquely effective because we not only have a massive amount of high fidelity data to continuously train our AI models but also because we couple that data with deep human cybersecurity expertise, which supports our industry-leading efficacy and low false positives. \nBy analyzing and correlating information across our massive, crowdsourced dataset, we are able to deploy our AI algorithms at cloud-scale and build a more intelligent, effective solution to detect threats and stop breaches that on-premise, cloud-hosted and hybrid products cannot match due to the inherent architectural limitations those products have with respect to data storage and analysis. The more data that is fed into our Falcon platform, the more intelligent the Security Cloud becomes, and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide.\nIndustry Background: The Trends Driving a Need for a New Approach to Security\nWe believe there are a number of important trends that drive the need for a new approach to security. These include:\n•\nThe Increasing Sophistication and Disruption of Cybersecurity Threats\n:\n \nAdversary sophistication continues to increase as militaries and intelligence services of well-funded nation-states, technically advanced criminal organizations and hackers advance their tactics. In addition, the commoditization of technologies like generative AI make it easier for low-skilled adversaries to move faster and launch more sophisticated attacks. This includes non-malware based attacks like social engineering that exploit user identities and credentials. These attacks are pervasive, targeting a broad range of industries including technology, transportation, healthcare, financial services, governments and political organizations, utility, retail, and public infrastructure. The number and scale of attacks continue to increase. The typical attack cycle starts with attackers attempting to penetrate endpoints to establish a beachhead. Once inside, adversaries steal and exploit legitimate credentials to escalate privileges, move laterally and progress and attack, often downloading malware or ransomware. At this stage in the threat lifecycle, the adversary is able to encrypt, destroy, or silently exfiltrate sensitive data.\n5\nTable of \nContents\n•\nAn Expanded Attack Surface Driven By Hybrid and Remote Workforces\n:\n \nOrganizations everywhere are embracing digital transformation and are becoming more distributed as they adopt the cloud, increase workforce mobility, and grow their number of connected devices. They are adding more workloads to a myriad of different endpoints beyond the traditional cybersecurity perimeter, exposing an increasingly broad attack surface to adversaries. This trend accelerated significantly with the need to support an increasingly remote workforce in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe this trend continues today.\n•\nA Growing Cyber Skills Gap\n:\n \nTrained cybersecurity professionals are in high demand, and organizations continue to face a dire shortage of talent to fill much needed cybersecurity positions. As a result, existing cybersecurity teams are often overwhelmed by the velocity of cyberattacks. Adversaries exploit this vacuum by continuing to accelerate their sophisticated attacks. \n•\nThe Need to Reduce Complexity and Simplify Security Operations\n: Organizations are increasingly looking to reduce the complexity of their security and IT stack. Modern security requires fewer point products, fewer agents and technologies that consume fewer resources. Increasingly, organizations are looking to standardize on trusted platforms that deliver an immediate return on investment and lower total cost of ownership. \nCompetitive Market: Existing Security Solutions Are Limited and Exacerbate Ongoing Trends\n:\n \nWe believe the aforementioned trends are exacerbated by the architectural limitations of legacy cybersecurity products and fragmented platforms, which are characterized by: \n•\nOn-Premise Security and Bolt-On Cloud Products That Lead to Constrained and Impacted Users\n: On-premise products are siloed, lack integration, and have limited ability to collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of data—attributes that are required to be effective in today’s increasingly dynamic threat landscape. Meanwhile, these solutions often require more agents on the endpoint as new capabilities are patchworked together, which can have a dramatic negative impact on user performance. \nMany on-premise vendors have tried to solve this problem by simply extending on-premise products to the cloud. Since their products were not purpose built to run in the cloud, traditional on-premise issues such as complex deployments, data silos, lack of integrations, limited scalability, and high maintenance costs continue to manifest. We believe that any product that was originally designed for on-premise deployments and migrated to the cloud cannot by definition be a cloud native solution.\nSome other vendors attempt to solve this problem by acquiring disparate products and stitching them together into fragmented platforms. This can force customers to focus on implementing integrations, not security outcomes and stopping the breach. The resulting complexity can impede workflows and slow down response time.\n•\nLegacy Signature-Based Products That Are Not Effective Against Unknown Threats\n: Signature-based products are designed to detect attacks that are already cataloged as previously identified threats. As a result, such products are fundamentally unable to prevent unknown threats resulting from shifts in attacker tradecraft. An attacker may be able to bypass a signature-based defense with just a slight modification to an existing attack. Many significant breaches seen in the last two decades have involved the failure of a legacy signature-based antivirus product to detect a previously unknown or modified version of a previously known attack.\n•\nMalware-Focused Products That Miss Sophisticated Attacks\n: Traditionally, organizations have focused on protecting their networks and endpoints against malware-based attacks. These attacks involve malware built for the specific purpose of performing malicious activities, stealing data, or destroying systems. Our 2024 Global Threat Report observed that over 70% of attacks comprise non-malware, hands-on-keyboard activity. Additionally, we found that eight out of 10 attacks involve compromised or stolen credentials, with these identity-based attacks easily able to bypass legacy approaches to protection. Therefore, a malware-centric defensive approach will leave the organization vulnerable to attacks that do not leverage malware.\n6\nTable of \nContents\n•\nApplication Whitelisting Products That Are Ineffective\n:\n \nApplication whitelisting products resort to an “always allow” or “always block” policy on an endpoint to allow or prevent processes from executing. Whitelisting relies in part on manually creating and maintaining a complex list of rules, burdening end users and IT organizations. This does not prevent fileless attacks from exploiting legitimate whitelisted applications, compromising the integrity of the whitelisting product.\n•\nThe Limitations of Legacy SIEMs\n: Originally designed years or even decades ago for a vastly different cybersecurity landscape, legacy SIEM solutions struggle to meet the demands of modern security operations. These systems lack the scalability to handle today’s data volumes and adversary speed, while escalating costs make centralized data collection and retention increasingly difficult. Poor scalability contributes to siloed, disjointed SOC architectures, forcing analysts to manually correlate data across multiple consoles, diverting time and resources from threat detection and response. Complex onboarding processes further delay time-to-value, requiring significant effort to integrate new data sources. As a result, legacy SIEMs hinder operational efficiency, limit visibility, and increase the risk of data breaches.\nCrowdStrike: Built for This Moment and the Future\nWe believe that the cloud-native architecture of the Falcon platform and Security Cloud provides a sustainable advantage in addressing the needs of our customers as their businesses and the threat landscape continues to evolve.\nWe offer our customers compelling business value that includes ease of adoption, rapid time-to-value, superior efficacy rates in detecting threats and preventing breaches, and reduced total cost of ownership by consolidating legacy, siloed, and multi-agent security products in a single solution. We also allow thinly-stretched security organizations to automate previously manual tasks, freeing them to focus on their most important objectives. With the Falcon platform, organizations can transform how they combat threats, transforming from slow, manual, and reactionary to fast, automated, and predictive, while gaining visibility across the threat lifecycle.\nKey benefits of our approach and the CrowdStrike Falcon platform include:\n•\nThe Power of the Crowd\n:\n \nOur crowdsourced data enables every customer to benefit from contributing to the Security Cloud. As more high fidelity data is fed into our Security Cloud, our AI models continue to train and improve, increasing the overall efficacy of the Falcon platform. This unique data layer is powered and turned into action by three complementary graph databases (Threat Graph, Intel Graph, and Asset Graph) to put threats, adversaries, and assets into the context needed to make the rapid, informed decisions that stop breaches.\n•\nDriving AI Innovation and Security\n: We are a pioneer in leveraging AI to transform cybersecurity, combining AI for cybersecurity with cybersecurity for AI. The Falcon platform’s AI-native architecture uses advanced models and the power of the Security Cloud to detect and stop breaches, while innovations like Charlotte AI represent a significant advancement in agentic AI—delivering autonomous security decisions within customer-defined guardrails to triage detections, reduce noise, and accelerate response. Charlotte AI, powered by high-fidelity data and continual training, reduces routine investigation workloads, bridging critical skills gaps for stretched teams. As AI continues to evolve, CrowdStrike is driving the next generation of AI-powered agentic cybersecurity—enabling AI to act independently while ensuring human oversight and control. Beyond delivering AI-driven protection, we also secure the AI systems organizations depend on, helping customers safeguard generative AI applications, protect sensitive data, and mitigate the risks posed by AI misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. By advancing AI innovation and security, we empower organizations to stay ahead of adversaries, increase operational efficiency, and securely embrace the AI-driven future.\n•\nHigh Efficacy, Low False Positives\n: The vast telemetry of the Security Cloud and the best practices employed in continually training our AI models results in exceptionally high efficacy rates and low false positives, delivering proven performance in real-world scenarios.\n7\nTable of \nContents\n•\nConsolidation of Siloed Products\n: Integrating and maintaining numerous security products creates blind spots that attackers can exploit, increases costs, and negatively impacts both end-user system performance and the experience of the security analyst. Our cloud-native platform gives customers a unified approach to address their most critical areas of risk seamlessly. We empower customers to rapidly deploy and scale industry leading technologies across Endpoint Security, Identity Protection, Cloud Security, Next-Gen SIEM and Modern Log Management, Data Protection, Exposure Management, IT Automation, ITSecOps and Risk, Threat Intelligence, and SaaS Security Posture Management from a single platform.\n•\nReducing Agent Bloat\n: Our single intelligent lightweight agent enables frictionless deployment of our platform at scale, enabling customers to rapidly adopt our technology across any type of workload running on a variety of endpoints. The agent is non-intrusive to the end user, requires no reboots and continues to protect the endpoint and track activity even when offline. Through our single lightweight agent approach, customers can adopt multiple platform modules to address their critical areas of risk without burdening the endpoint with multiple agents. Legacy approaches often require multiple agents as they layer on new capabilities. This can severely impact user performance and create barriers to security. \n•\nRapid Time to Value\n: Our cloud-native platform was built to rapidly scale industry leading protection across the entire enterprise, eliminating lengthy implementation periods and professional services engagements that next-gen and legacy competitors may require. Our single agent, collect once and re-use many times approach enables us to activate new modules in real time.\n•\nElite Security Teams as a Force Multiplier\n:\n \nAdversaries are relentlessly innovating new forms of sophisticated  attacks, bypassing traditional malware to exploit user credentials and identities. In this evolving landscape, automation and autonomous security\n \nare no longer sufficient on their own. Stopping today’s sophisticated attacks requires a combination of powerful automation and elite threat hunting. Falcon Complete provides a comprehensive monitoring, management, response, and remediation solution to our customers and is designed to bring enterprise level security to companies that may lack the resources or expertise to do so on their own. \nCrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch, part of CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations, combines world-class human intelligence from our elite security experts with the power of the Falcon platform. OverWatch is a force multiplier that extends the capabilities and improves the productivity of our customers’ security teams. Because our world-class team can see attacks across our entire customer base, their expertise is enhanced by their constant visibility into the threat landscape. Additionally, the insights of our OverWatch team can then be leveraged by the Falcon platform to further enhance its autonomous capabilities, creating a positive feedback loop for our customers.\n•\nAlleviating the Skills Shortage through Automation\n: CrowdStrike automates manual tasks to free security teams to focus on their most important job – stopping the breach. Our Falcon Fusion capability automates workflows to reduce the need to switch between different security tools and tasks, while our Falcon Insight XDR module provides a unified solution that enables security teams to rapidly and efficiently identify, hunt, and eliminate threats across multiple security domains using first and third party datasets.\n•\nLower Total Cost of Ownership\n: Our cloud-native platform eliminates our customers’ need for initial or ongoing purchases of hardware and does not require their personnel to configure, implement or integrate disparate point products. Additionally, our comprehensive platform reduces overall personnel costs associated with ongoing maintenance, as well as the need for software patches and upgrades for separate products.\nSecuring Identities and Data Across the Pillars of Modern Enterprise Security\nAs modern attacks and adversaries grow more sophisticated, CrowdStrike believes that stopping breaches in the modern era requires security that delivers unified visibility and protection across three critical areas: Endpoint and Cloud workloads, Identity Threat Protection and Data Protection.\n8\nTable of \nContents\nApproximately eighty percent of breaches today use stolen credentials and identities. Stopping these advanced attacks requires a holistic approach that delivers true end-to-end protection across workloads, identities, and data. CrowdStrike is able to natively enforce protection at the device layer, the identity layer, and the data layer, extending our bold vision for security by driving modern Defense in Depth to the enterprise.\nBy delivering these powerful capabilities through a unified platform with a single agent, CrowdStrike is able to connect the endpoint and workload to user identity, and the data that is being used and accessed. Customers can see the full health and state of endpoints and workloads, in context with the identity that is using and accessing them, aligned with where data is being created, who is using it, where it flows and how it is protected. CrowdStrike delivers this through a unified platform experience. This is how CrowdStrike believes security should and must be delivered today to combat advanced adversaries and stop breaches in the modern era. This means security solutions that are easy to deploy, easy to manage, and highly effective.\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon Platform: Built to Innovate and Scale \nOur platform approach allows us to rapidly innovate, build, and deploy highly integrated modules that address critical customer problems and access additional market opportunities. Our Falcon platform is composed of two tightly integrated proprietary technologies: our lightweight agent and our Security Cloud.

We have a low friction land-and-expand sales strategy. Key elements of our growth strategy include:\n•\nGrowing Our Customer Base by Replacing Legacy and Other Endpoint Security Products. \nGiven the limitations of existing legacy and other endpoint security products, many organizations are replacing their existing legacy and other endpoint security products with our Falcon platform. We will continue to invest in customer acquisition programs, including our channel partnerships and new programs, like our free trial program of Falcon Prevent that is easily downloaded from our website and AWS Marketplace.\n10\nTable of \nContents\n•\nFurther Penetrating Existing Customers. \nOur growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to expand our relationships with our customers by deploying on additional endpoints in their environment and cross-selling more cloud modules. When customers deploy our lightweight agent, they can easily add additional cloud modules. We also offer in-application trial usage of additional modules to cross-sell to existing customers. While some new customers initially deploy our Falcon platform broadly across the organization, others elect to deploy only in selected business units and later deploy on additional endpoints and subscribe to additional modules. Over time, we seek to deploy our solution enterprise-wide for all customers. The power of our land-and-expand strategy is evidenced by our 112% dollar-based net retention rate as of January 31, 2025.\n•\nLeveraging Our Falcon Platform to Enter New Markets. \nBecause we leverage a single data model and open cloud architecture, we are uniquely positioned to continue innovating and rapidly deploying new cloud modules on our platform. For example, Falcon Discover includes use cases outside of security, such as application license management, AWS spend analysis, and asset inventory. Because our lightweight agent collects diverse endpoint data once for repeated use, we can expand our addressable market by rapidly adding new cloud modules that leverage this data. We intend to continue to develop new cloud modules for broader endpoint use cases.\n•\nBroadening Our Reach into New Customer Segments. \nWhile we initially targeted large sophisticated enterprises, we have expanded our go-to-market efforts to include customers of all sizes with a dedicated inside sales team focused on smaller organizations. We also released Falcon Complete in 2018, our turnkey solution that combines the most popular cloud modules of our Falcon platform with our remediation and response capabilities, to create a solution for customers with limited or no internal security expertise. As a result, we can sell our Falcon platform to the largest enterprises or smallest businesses with any level of security sophistication and budget. We continue to look for new ways to broaden our reach into new customer segments.\n•\nBroadening Our Reach into U.S. Public Sector Verticals. \nWe continue to invest heavily in the acquisition of customers in the U.S. federal government as well as the state, local, and higher education verticals. Our platform is authorized by several federal agencies via the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”). Additionally, Department of Defense organizations can rely upon CrowdStrike’s Impact Level 5 provisional authorization to satisfy their cloud-based security requirements. To further meet the compliance demands of the government, customers can elect to deploy the Falcon platform in the AWS GovCloud. We have also successfully been embedded into several strategic government-wide cybersecurity programs and contracts, such as the Department of Homeland Security’s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Approved Products List, which serves to provide federal agencies with innovative security tools. As a result, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has leveraged a significant investment in our platform to support modernization efforts within the Federal Civilian Executive Branch. Further evidence of our progress into these critical markets is demonstrated by virtue of the fact that 25 of the 50 U.S. states have standardized on CrowdStrike’s platform at the enterprise level.\n•\nExpanding Our International Footprint. \nWe are expanding our international operations and intend to invest globally to broaden our international footprint. We grew our international revenue from $967.5 million for fiscal 2024 to $1,270.7 million for fiscal 2025, representing an increase of 31%. We intend to grow our international customer base by increasing our investments in our overseas operations, including adding headcount in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, including Japan, and expanding data centers overseas. \n•\nExtending Our Falcon Platform and Ecosystem. \nWe designed our architecture to be open, interoperable, and highly extensible. We launched the CrowdStrike Marketplace, the first open cloud-based application PaaS for cybersecurity, which allows customers to purchase CrowdStrike products and provides an ecosystem of trusted partners and applications for our customers to choose from. We plan to continue investing in the CrowdStrike Store to empower our partners by making it easier to build applications and to enable our customers to more easily discover, try, and purchase additional cloud modules from both trusted partners and us.\nTechnology\nWe have designed an innovative architecture from the ground up to overcome the limitations of existing security products and deliver cloud-based solutions. The key design principles of our Falcon platform include:\n11\nTable of \nContents\nCloud Native Architecture. \nWe built the Falcon platform entirely in and for the cloud, enabling collection and analysis of a massive, crowdsourced dataset from all of our customers to stop breaches. Our platform is designed to be redundant, resilient, and high-performing. Delivering security from the cloud enables agility, ease of use, and protection for workloads on a variety of endpoints wherever they are located. As customer adoption grows, the network effect of each additional endpoint added to the Falcon platform will amplify the breadth and depth of our dataset and intelligence.\nFalcon Agent.\n \nWe designed an intelligent lightweight agent that is installed on each endpoint or cloud workload. This agent incorporates identification and prevention of known and unknown malware and fileless attacks using machine learning, AI, exploit blocking, and advanced behavioral techniques, to protect workloads across all endpoints while capturing and recording high fidelity endpoint data. Our agent is capable of acting autonomously and continues to collect data and protect workloads running on endpoints even when offline. The agent recommences transmitting data to our Falcon platform when the connection to the cloud has been re-established. Our lightweight agent is built to support Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. The agent is hardened against attacks and uses a combination of kernel and user-mode modules to collect and transmit high fidelity endpoint events as they take place on a system. It correlates these events using a local situational model on the endpoint, analyzes via agent-based AI models and is capable of taking a variety of preventative and responsive actions on the endpoint, either automatically or via human control. Events are streamed by the agent to the cloud in real time in order to be further analyzed in the Threat Graph, where additional correlation and AI algorithms can be applied. The agent is also capable of being remotely reconfigured in real time based on analytics in our cloud platform to collect and analyze different events or take other actions as risk and threat postures change.\nThreat Graph.\n \nThreat Graph is our proprietary, powerful, scalable, and dynamic graph database. Threat Graph continually looks for malicious activity by combining AI with behavioral pattern-matching techniques to look beyond file features and track the behaviors of every OS process and software program executed on an endpoint in a customer’s network environment. By applying powerful graph analytics and AI algorithms to cybersecurity, we enrich the data collected with our proprietary and third-party threat intelligence, such as adversary capabilities, motivations, attributions, and threat indicators. The graph data model allows our AI algorithms to identify relationships between events that are not directly related but which could indicate an attack that would otherwise remain undetected. We believe that our AI algorithms are advantaged by the rich proprietary dataset that we use to train them. Threat Graph provides customers with complete real time and historical visibility and insight into events occurring on their endpoints for hunting and searching, even if the endpoint is unreachable or no longer exists.\nThreat Graph also provides query and hunting capability over the full set of high-fidelity events collected in the graph. This correlated data, natively represented in a graph structure, enables new products and cloud modules to be created rapidly since the platform provides the visibility, collection, correlation, and actions over data as reusable building blocks. This collect-once, use repeatedly approach is the reason why we have been able to deliver new cloud modules covering IT hygiene and vulnerability management quickly and enables us to continue expanding the Falcon platform rapidly in the future. \nIntel Graph. \nIntel Graph analyzes and correlates massive amounts of data on adversaries, their victims and their tools, providing extraordinary insights into shifting adversary tactics and techniques, powering our adversary-focused approach with world-class threat intelligence. \nAsset Graph.\n Asset Graph dynamically monitors and tracks the complex interactions among enterprise entities, providing a single holistic view of the risks those assets pose. Asset Graph provides graph visualizations of the relationships among entities and assets such as devices, users, accounts, cloud workloads, along with the rich context necessary for proper security hygiene and proactive security posture management to reduce risk in their organizations.\nHigh Fidelity Data and Smart Filtering.\n \nThe presence of a local graph model in our agent enables it to track the state of the machine in real time, perform rapid machine learning and behavioral analysis, and provide efficient event streaming to the cloud. We call this “smart filtering.” This allows us to keep performance overhead on the endpoint to a minimum, dramatically reduce the bandwidth required for agent-cloud communication, efficiently process large volumes of data, and separate signals from noise. The Falcon agent collects and analyzes unfiltered data with local machine learning and behavioral algorithms on the endpoint but only streams high fidelity endpoint events to the cloud to just send what is necessary for detection, prevention and investigation of attacks. This smart filtering architecture allows us to reduce network load for our customers. The Falcon platform collects an array of high fidelity endpoint events, such as code execution, network, file system and user activity. This information can be used for a variety of use cases beyond security, such as IT operations and vulnerability management.\n12\nTable of \nContents\nManagement Interface.\n \nThe Falcon platform management interface gives customers an intuitive and informative view of their complete environment, with timely alerts and detailed search capabilities. We provide real-time endpoint and cloud workload visibility to allow customers to review details and respond to threats instantly and effectively, from anywhere, and maintain an index of these events for future use.\nAPIs and Integrations.\n \nOur Falcon platform and architecture is built around a rich set of APIs that efficiently and effectively complement and expand a customer’s existing security infrastructure, such as security information event management, or SIEMs, intrusion prevention systems and intrusion detection systems. The platform includes streaming, query and batch APIs allowing customers and partners to integrate a variety of solutions seamlessly. It also includes rich management and control APIs. The platform allows third parties to develop additional cloud modules and features, furthering the power of the Falcon platform. By connecting existing security systems to the Falcon platform, we allow our customers to further leverage their security investments.\nData Center Operations\nWe have data center co-location facilities throughout the United States and in Europe, and we also utilize third-party data centers located in the United States and Europe. Our technology infrastructure, combined with select use of third-party resources, provides us with a distributed, resilient and scalable architecture on a global scale.\nProfessional Services\nIn addition to our Falcon platform and cloud modules, we also offer incident response, forensic investigatory, and breach recovery services; technical assessment and strategic advisory services; Next-Gen SEIM consulting; platform deployment and operational services; as well as training and certifications to assist organizations that have experienced a breach or who are assessing their security posture and ability to respond to breaches.\n•\nIncident Response, Forensics, and Recovery Services.\n \nOur incident response services typically begin by deploying our lightweight agent to a customer’s endpoints or cloud workloads to provide visibility in order to determine if an attacker is currently in the environment, what assets have been compromised, and how much damage has been done. In addition to enriching the response team’s understanding of the attack, the full suite of Falcon platform’s next-gen prevention capabilities, cloud security, exposure management, and identity protection offerings can also be leveraged to help to slow down and prevent an active attacker from moving at-will throughout a compromised customer’s environment, increasing the risk and potential damage to the customer. We also provide customized surgical recovery services by providing the tools and staffing to eject attackers out of the network, lock down credentials from further use, remediate impacted systems and ensure adversaries stay out. In addition to providing valuable breach remediation to our customers, our incident response services also act as a strong lead generation engine for our Falcon platform and cloud modules. After experiencing the benefits of our platform firsthand, many of our incident response customers become subscription customers. \n•\nTechnical Assessment and Strategic Advisory Services\n.\n \nOur proactive security services include technical assessment services designed to help organizations understand their cyber maturity levels. These services include both endpoint and cloud workload compromise assessments, cybersecurity maturity assessments, security program in-depth assessments, service organization control assessments, IT hygiene assessments, and active directory security assessments. We also advise customers on readiness and preparation through the execution of table-top exercises, live fire exercises, red team/blue team assessments, and advanced adversary emulation exercises. We have also added AI red-teaming to help organizations understand where these models can have risk, where they can be exploited and where to take corrective security actions. All of these services are designed to evaluate our customers’ security profile so they can identify areas of vulnerability, secure their network, and improve their response if their defenses are breached. Our services also align to executive and board level cybersecurity training and awareness, including by helping public companies more confidently comply with public disclosure requirements relating to assessing, identifying and managing material cybersecurity risks, and reporting material cyber incidents. Our programs are designed to help organizations effectively achieve cybersecurity risk reduction objectives and to maximize investments.\n13\nTable of \nContents\n•\nNextGen SIEM Professional Services. \nOur NG-SIEM professional services offer a comprehensive suite of deployment packages and ongoing support options designed to help organizations seamlessly implement and optimize the Falcon NG-SIEM platform.

As of January 31, 2025, we are trusted by more than 74,000 organizations, including our end customers and those of our Managed Security Service Providers (“MSSP”), worldwide. Historically, we and our channel partners have primarily sold to large organizations, but have increasingly focused on selling to small and medium-sized businesses, particularly through our trial-to-pay model. We engage our customers through our global customer and technical advisory boards in which we solicit feedback from our customers on a regular basis allowing us to understand their evolving needs. We have used this feedback to develop new cloud modules, such as Falcon FileVantage, and we intend to continue to develop new cloud modules based on our customer’s feedback. Our business is not dependent on any particular end customer.\n14\nTable of \nContents\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, build a strong sales pipeline and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth.\nSales\nWe primarily sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules through our world-class, global sales team, which is comprised of field sales and inside sales professionals who are segmented by a customer’s organizational size. Our sales team also leverages a powerful go-to-market sales motion with our vast ecosystem of channel and alliances partners. We also use our sales team to identify current customers who may be interested in free trials of additional cloud modules, which serves as a powerful driver of our land and expand model. By segmenting our sales teams, we can deploy a low-touch sales model that efficiently identifies prospective customers.\nMarketing\nOur marketing organization is focused on building our brand reputation, increasing the awareness and reputation of our platform, and driving customer demand. As part of these efforts, we deliver targeted content to demonstrate thought leadership in the security industry, including speaking engagements with the security industry’s foremost organizations to provide expert advice, issuing regular reports on the state of the industry, educating the public about cybersecurity threats, and identifying and naming adversary groups. We also engage in paid media, web marketing, industry and trade conferences (including our annual Fal.Con conference), analyst engagements, whitepaper development, demand generation via digital and web, and targeted displacement campaigns. We employ a wide range of digital programs, including search engine marketing, online and social media initiatives, and content syndication to increase traffic to our website and encourage prospective customers to sign up for a free trial of the Falcon platform. Additionally, we engage in joint marketing activities with our channel and technology alliance partners.\nPartnership Ecosystem\nWe operate a partner-first go-to-market strategy to land new logos and expand in existing accounts. We partner with a diverse set of partners. We work with a wide array of go-to-market partners in our technology alliance partners to design go-to-market strategies that combine our platform with products or services provided by our technology alliance partners. These partner integrations deliver more secure solutions and an improved end user experience to their customers. Our technology alliance partnerships focus on security analytics, network and infrastructure security, threat platforms and orchestration, and automation. We launched the CrowdStrike Store, the first open cloud-based application PaaS for cybersecurity and the industry’s first unified security cloud ecosystem of trusted third-party applications. In addition, Falcon for AWS, available in the AWS Marketplace, allows customers to easily purchase and take advantage of the metered billing (pay-as-you-go) pricing option to scale their consumption as their business needs change.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development organizations are responsible for the design, architecture, operation and quality of our cloud native Falcon platform. In addition, the research and development organizations work closely with our customer success teams to promote customer satisfaction.\nOur success is a result of our continuous drive for innovation. Our internal team of security experts, researchers, intelligence analysts, and threat hunters continuously analyzes the evolving global threat landscape to develop products that defend against today’s most sophisticated and stealthy attacks and report on emerging security issues. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our Falcon platform, and develop new cloud modules, features and functionality. We believe timely development of new, and enhancement of our existing products, services, and features is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We work closely with our customers and channel partners to gain valuable insight into their security management practices to assist us in designing new cloud modules and features that extend the capability of our platform. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we also make our Falcon platform available for third-party validation. We also maintain a regular release process to update and enhance our existing solutions. In addition, we engage security consulting firms to perform periodic vulnerability analysis of our solutions. \n15\nTable of \nContents\nOur research and development leadership team is located in Seattle, Washington and Sunnyvale, California. We also maintain research and development centers in Irvine, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bucharest, Romania, Israel and India. We employ subject matter experts in a number of jurisdictions around the world. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development.\nCompetition\nWe primarily compete with established and emerging security product vendors. While the market for traditional endpoint and IT operations solutions has historically been intensely competitive, we believe that the architecture of our cloud-native, single agent platform fundamentally differentiates us compared to both next-gen and legacy competitors in the security industry. Additionally, as we look to enter into adjacent markets and expand our total addressable market, we may face new competitors. However, we do not believe any of our competitors currently have a true platform offering equivalent to the Falcon platform, which can be leveraged to win in legacy markets and define new categories.\nOur competitors currently include the following by general category:\n•\nlegacy antivirus product providers who offer a broad range of approaches and solutions including traditional signature-based antivirus protection;\n•\nalternative endpoint security providers who generally offer a mix of on-premises and cloud-hosted products that rely heavily on malware-only or application whitelisting techniques;\n•\nnetwork security vendors who are supplementing their core perimeter-based offerings with endpoint or cloud security solutions; \n•\ncloud security vendors, including those who focus on public cloud infrastructure and services;\n•\nidentity security vendors that seek to identify and secure user accounts and related activities; \n•\nprofessional service providers who offer cybersecurity response services; and \n•\nlegacy SIEM vendors who offer a range of log management and security capabilities.\nWe compete on the basis of a number of factors, including but not limited to our:\n•\nability to offer a unified and modular platform that enables rapid innovation, scaling, and deployment;\n•\nability to identify security threats and prevent security breaches;\n•\nability to integrate with other participants in the security ecosystem;\n•\ntime to value, price, and total cost of ownership;\n•\nbrand awareness, reputation, and trust in the provider’s services;\n•\nstrength of sales, marketing, and channel partner relationships; \n•\ncustomer support, incident response, and proactive services; and\n•\nability to rapidly ingest and search both first and third-party data.\nAlthough certain of our competitors enjoy greater resources, recognition, deeper customer relationships, larger existing customer bases, or more mature intellectual property portfolios, we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider of endpoint and workload security solutions.\n16\nTable of \nContents\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe continue to grow our global portfolio of intellectual property rights in connection with our products, services, research and development, and other activities to protect our proprietary technology relevant to our business. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We intend to continue pursuing additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our security platform and other solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. In particular, some companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products or solutions, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Legal, and Regulatory Matters—The success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.”\nBacklog\nWe enter into both single and multi-year subscription contracts for our solutions. We generally invoice our subscription customers at the beginning of the subscription term, or in some instances, such as in multi-year arrangements, in installments. Until we have the contractual right to invoice, these contract amounts are classified as backlog. They are not recorded in deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. As of January 31, 2025, we had backlog of approximately $2.8 billion. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing and duration of customer renewals. Because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contract renewals and new customer contracts during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future revenue performance. We do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nSeasonality\nGiven the annual budget approval process of many of our customers, we see seasonal patterns in our business. Net new ARR generation is typically greater in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, as compared to the first half of the year. In addition, we also experience seasonality in our operating margin, typically with a lower margin in the first half of our fiscal year due to a step up in costs for payroll taxes and annual sales and marketing events. This also impacts the timing of operating cash flow.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had 10,118 full-time employees. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\n17\nTable of \nContents\nAttraction, Retention, and Talent Development\nSupporting our people is a foundational value for CrowdStrike. We believe the company’s success depends on our ability to attract, retain and develop employees. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our customers, operations and our overall company performance. \nOur talent sourcing is aligned to our organizational strategy to provide the expertise and skills needed to move our mission forward. We have created a high-performance talent model that pinpoints the top traits and qualities we look for in talent and that may already exist within the organization, then consistently use that model to develop interview questions, screen candidates, and make hiring decisions.\nCrowdStrike has always been a mission-focused organization. We hire and develop people based on their merits and alignment to our mission of stopping breaches. Our work requires us to consider problems from all angles. We believe that an open, collaborative environment strengthens our ability to build strong teams, serve our customers and drive innovation.\nTo attract high performers, we have a team dedicated to building and promoting our employer brand focused on creating a strong employer value proposition, which includes:\n•\nCompetitive pay and benefits\n•\nFlexible working arrangements\n•\nRole and task diversity\n•\nProfessional development opportunities \n•\nOrganizational reputation and culture\nWe provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base salary, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses or commission plans, equity awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan or pension schemes internationally, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and infertility assistance, and employee assistance programs.\nWe invest resources to develop the talent needed to remain a leader in cybersecurity. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and ensure we manage performance, provide feedback, and develop talent.\nDistributed Workforce\nFor CrowdStrike, the ability to work remotely or in a hybrid arrangement is a deliberate strategy that we believe fuels rapid innovation and helps us attract, hire and retain the best and brightest around the world, regardless of their specific location. Our culture is purpose-built around this ability, creating a competitive advantage for both the company and its customers and minimizing disruption from localized issues such as natural disasters, political events, or health emergencies.\nCrowdStrike has had a distributed workforce since its inception. While working remotely has its advantages, we also believe that building community and engagement happens at a faster pace when people can come together.\nSince the beginning, we recognized that creating high-functioning, effective remote and hybrid teams would require careful planning and system design to not only establish the culture but help it grow and evolve organically. We have designed our processes, systems, and teams so that most employees can perform their jobs without needing to be physically present in the same room or even in the same time zone. Part of supporting our remote and hybrid culture also involves actively encouraging personal well-being through initiatives, including wellness programs, engagement programs (speaker series, employee resource groups, gift exchanges, mentorship opportunities, virtual events, etc.), community outreach activities, recognition programs, and groups to connect people, no matter where they are geographically, with similar interests, life circumstances or backgrounds. We continue to find ways to bring our employees together to build community and camaraderie. \n18\nTable of \nContents\nOur People and Core Values\nAt CrowdStrike, we embrace the mantra of “One Team. One Fight.” Our global team is passionate about working together toward our mission to stop breaches, knowing they will be fully included, supported and valued along the way. We are Fanatical About the Customer, Relentlessly Focused on Innovation and believe that our Limitless Passion drives Unlimited Potential for every CrowdStriker. Our Core Values sum up our culture. We provide the support and resources needed to enable people to do their best work.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to our current executive officers as of March 10, 2025:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nGeorge Kurtz\n54\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nBurt W.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” You should review the disclosure under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Our fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, January 31, 2024, and January 31, 2023, are referred to herein as fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023, respectively.\nOverview\nFounded in 2011, CrowdStrike reinvented cybersecurity for the cloud era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers. When we started CrowdStrike, cyberattackers had an asymmetric advantage over legacy cybersecurity products that could not keep pace with the rapid changes in adversary tactics. We took a fundamentally different approach to solve this problem with the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform – the first, true cloud-native unified platform built with AI at the core, capable of harnessing vast amounts of security and enterprise data to deliver highly modular solutions through a single lightweight agent. \nWe believe our approach has defined a new category called the Security Cloud, which has transformed the cybersecurity industry the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. Using cloud-scale AI, our Security Cloud enriches and correlates trillions of cybersecurity events per week with indicators of attack, threat intelligence, and enterprise data (including data from across endpoints, workloads, identities, DevOps, IT assets, and configurations) to create actionable data, identify shifts in adversary tactics, and automatically prevent threats in real-time across our customer base. The more data that is fed into our Falcon platform, the more intelligent our Security Cloud becomes, and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide.\nOur Go-To-Market Strategy\nWe sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules to organizations across multiple industries. We primarily sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules through our direct sales team that leverages our network of channel partners. Our direct sales team is comprised of field sales and inside sales professionals who are segmented by a customer’s number of endpoints.\nWe have a low friction land-and-expand sales strategy. When customers deploy our Falcon platform, they can start with any number of cloud modules and easily add additional cloud modules. Once customers experience the benefits of our Falcon platform, they often expand their adoption over time by adding more endpoints or purchasing additional modules. We also use our sales team to identify current customers who may be interested in free trials of additional cloud modules, which serves as a powerful driver of our land-and-expand model. By segmenting our sales teams, we can deploy a low-touch sales model that efficiently identifies prospective customers.\nWe began as a solution for large enterprises, but the flexibility and scalability of our Falcon platform has enabled us to seamlessly offer our solution to customers of any size. We have expanded our sales focus to include any sized organization without the need to modify our Falcon platform for small and medium sized businesses.\n61\nTable of \nContents\nA substantial majority of our customers purchase subscriptions with a term over one year. Our subscriptions are generally priced on a per-endpoint and per-module basis. We recognize revenue from our subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription. We also generate revenue from our incident response and proactive professional services, which are generally priced on a time and materials basis. We view our professional services business primarily as an opportunity to cross-sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules.\nCertain Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAdoption of Our Solutions. \nWe believe our future success depends in large part on the growth in the market for cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions. Many organizations have not yet abandoned the on-premise legacy products in which they have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and maintain. As a result, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our cloud-based solutions.\nNew Customer Acquisition. \nOur future growth depends in large part on our ability to acquire new customers. If our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline. We believe that our go-to-market strategy and the flexibility and scalability of our Falcon platform allow us to rapidly expand our customer base. Our incident response and proactive services also help drive new customer acquisitions, as many of these professional services customers subsequently purchase subscriptions to our Falcon platform. Many organizations have not yet adopted cloud-based security solutions, and since our Falcon platform has offerings for organizations of all sizes, worldwide, and across industries, we believe this presents a significant opportunity for growth.\nMaintain Customer Retention and Increase Sales. \nOur ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and increase the size of their subscriptions. We focus on increasing sales to our existing customers by expanding their deployments to more endpoints and selling additional cloud modules for increased functionality. Over time we have transitioned our platform from a single offering into highly-integrated offerings of multiple cloud modules. \nInvest in Growth. \nWe believe that our market opportunity is large and requires us to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing efforts to further grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. Our open cloud architecture and single data model have allowed us to rapidly build and deploy new cloud modules, and we expect to continue investing in those efforts to further enhance our technology platform and product functionality. In addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our Falcon platform, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets. Furthermore, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future given the additional expenses for accounting, compliance, and investor relations as we grow as a public company.\nJuly 19 Incident\n. On July 19, 2024, we released a content configuration update for our Falcon sensor that resulted in system crashes for certain Windows systems (the “July 19 Incident”). As a result of the July 19 Incident, we are subject to lawsuits, claims and inquiries as described in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n. \nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant legal and professional services and other general and administrative expenses associated with the July 19 Incident in future periods. It is not reasonably possible to quantify the precise impact of the July 19 Incident, but the incident has adversely affected our results of operations, and we currently expect a number of factors relating to the incident to adversely affect our key metrics and results of operations in future periods. While we have maintained high dollar-based gross retention rates following the incident, we have experienced delays in creating sales opportunities and longer sales cycles, including delays in customer purchasing decisions. We expect sales cycles to continue to be elongated in future periods. In addition, because our customers typically sign contracts with terms of twelve months or longer, customer churn and any corresponding impact to our key metrics and revenue may occur in future periods. Customer commitment packages introduced following the July 19 Incident have included discounting, additional modules, professional services, flexible payment terms or subscription period extensions. Our customer commitment packages have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in increased contraction, due to elongated subscription terms, and decreased upsell dollar values.\n62\nTable of \nContents\nKey Metrics\nWe monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (\n“\nARR\n”\n)\nARR is calculated as the annualized value of our customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that we are negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, we continue to include that revenue in ARR if we are actively in discussion with such organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies us that it is not renewing its subscription.\nThe following table sets forth our ARR as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):\nAs of January 31,\n2025\n2024\nAnnual recurring revenue\n$\n4,241,838\n$\n3,435,150\nYear-over-year growth\n23 \n%\n34 \n%\nARR increased 23% year-over-year and grew to $4.2 billion as of January 31, 2025, of which $806.7 million was net new ARR added during fiscal 2025. ARR increased 34% year-over-year and grew to $3.4 billion as of January 31, 2024, of which $875.5 million was net new ARR added during fiscal 2024.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate\nOur dollar-based net retention rate compares our ARR from a set of subscription customers against the same metric for those subscription customers from the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate reflects customer renewals, expansion, contraction, and churn, and excludes revenue from our incident response and proactive services. We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of period end by starting with the ARR from all subscription customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these same subscription customers as of the current period end, or Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or churn over the trailing 12 months but excludes revenue from new subscription customers in the current period. We then divide the Current Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at our dollar-based net retention rate. For the purposes of calculating our dollar-based net retention rate, we define a subscription customer as a separate legal entity that has entered into a distinct subscription agreement for access to our Falcon platform for which the term has not ended or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract. We do not consider our channel partners as customers, and we treat managed service security providers, who may purchase our products on behalf of multiple companies, as a single customer.\nOur dollar-based net retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in a given period and incentives provided, which may reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in subsequent periods. In addition, if our customers are not able to fully utilize their product subscriptions (including in connection with our flexible subscription offering), we may experience increased contraction as such customers may elect to renew with shorter subscription periods, fewer cloud modules, fewer endpoints or smaller contract values, which may reduce our dollar-based net retention rate.\nAs of January 31,\n2025\n2024\nDollar-based net retention rate\n112 \n%\n119 \n%\n63\nTable of \nContents\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription Revenue. \nSubscription revenue primarily consists of subscription fees for our Falcon platform and additional cloud modules that are supported by our cloud-based platform. Subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscription customers, the number of endpoints per customer, and the number of cloud modules included in the subscription. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the agreement, which is generally one to three years. We generally invoice our subscription customers at the beginning of the subscription term, or in some instances, such as in multi-year arrangements, in installments. Consequently, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions that we entered into during previous periods.\nProfessional Services Revenue. \nProfessional services revenue includes incident response and proactive services, forensic and malware analysis, attribution analysis, operationalizing the Falcon Platform, residency program, and active defense services. Professional services are generally sold separately from subscriptions to our Falcon platform, although customers frequently enter into a separate arrangement to purchase subscriptions to our Falcon platform at the conclusion of a professional services arrangement. Professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, one-time and ongoing engagements, and retainer-based agreements. For time and materials and retainer-based arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed. Fixed fee contracts account for an immaterial portion of our revenue.\nCost of Revenue\nSubscription Cost of Revenue. \nSubscription cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our cloud-based Falcon platform in data centers, amortization of our capitalized internal-use software, employee-related costs such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees, property and equipment depreciation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs.\nAs new customers subscribe to our platform and existing subscription customers increase the number of endpoints on our Falcon platform, our cost of revenue will increase due to greater cloud hosting costs related to powering new cloud modules and the incremental costs for storing additional data collected for such cloud modules and employee-related costs. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our cloud platform and our customer support organizations as we grow our business. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future.\nProfessional Services Cost of Revenue. \nProfessional services cost of revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, consulting expense, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new subscription customers, renewals from existing subscription customers, sales of additional modules to existing subscription customers, the data center and bandwidth costs associated with operating our cloud platform, the extent to which we expand our customer support and cloud operations organizations, and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology, infrastructure, and data centers through technological improvements. We expect our gross profit to increase in dollar amount and our gross margin to increase modestly over the long term as we grow our business, although our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors. Demand for our incident response services is driven by the number of breaches experienced by non-customers. Also, we view our professional services solutions in the context of our larger business and as a significant lead generator for new subscriptions. Because of these factors, our services revenue and gross margin may fluctuate over time.\n64\nTable of \nContents\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general administrative expenses. For each of these categories of expense, employee-related expenses are the most significant component, which include salaries, employee bonuses, sales commissions, and employer payroll tax. Operating expenses also include an allocated portion of overhead costs for facilities and other administrative functions.\nSales and Marketing. \nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries, commissions, and bonuses. Sales and marketing expenses also include stock-based compensation; expenses related to our marketing programs; and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses. Sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, which includes commissions and any other incremental payments made upon the initial acquisition of a subscription or upsells to existing customers, which are capitalized and amortized over the estimated customer life. We also capitalize and amortize any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription over the term of the renewal.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base. However, we anticipate sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time as we grow our business, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses.\nResearch and Development. \nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries and bonuses; stock-based compensation; cloud hosting and related costs; and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses. Our cloud platform is software-driven, and our research and development teams employ software engineers in the design, and the related development, testing, certification, and support of these solutions.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to increase investments in our technology architecture and software platform. However, we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time as we grow our business, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries and bonuses; stock-based compensation; and related expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside legal, accounting, and other professional fees; and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount over time. We expect to incur significant legal and professional services and other expenses associated with the July 19 Incident in future periods. General and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses.\nInterest Expense.\n Interest expense consists primarily of amortization of debt issuance costs, contractual interest expense for our Senior Notes issued in January 2021, and amortization of debt issuance costs on our secured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Facility”).\nInterest Income. \nInterest income consists primarily of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. \nOther Income, Net. \nOther income, net consists primarily of gains and losses on strategic investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\n65\nTable of \nContents\nProvision for Income Taxes. \nProvision for income taxes consists of state income taxes in the United States, foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes related to customer payments in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, which we have determined are not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. We regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance. \nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest\n. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest consists of the Falcon Funds’ non-controlling interest share of gains and losses and interest income from our strategic investments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated statements of operations for each period presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nRevenue\nSubscription\n$\n3,761,480 \n$\n2,870,557 \n$\n2,111,660 \nProfessional services\n192,144 \n184,998 \n129,576 \nTotal revenue\n3,953,624 \n3,055,555 \n2,241,236 \nCost of revenue\nSubscription\n835,509 \n630,745 \n511,684 \nProfessional services\n155,972 \n124,978 \n89,547 \nTotal cost of revenue\n991,481 \n755,723 \n601,231 \nGross profit\n2,962,143 \n2,299,832 \n1,640,005 \nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing\n1,523,356 \n1,140,566 \n904,409 \nResearch and development\n1,076,901 \n768,497 \n608,364 \nGeneral and administrative\n482,316 \n392,764 \n317,344 \nTotal operating expenses\n3,082,573 \n2,301,827 \n1,830,117 \nLoss from operations\n(120,430)\n(1,995)\n(190,112)\nInterest expense\n(26,311)\n(25,756)\n(25,319)\nInterest income\n196,174 \n148,930 \n52,495 \nOther income, net\n5,101 \n1,638 \n3,053 \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes\n54,534 \n122,817 \n(159,883)\nProvision for income taxes\n71,130 \n32,232 \n22,402 \nNet income (loss)\n(16,596)\n90,585 \n(182,285)\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\n2,675 \n1,258 \n960 \nNet income (loss) attributable to CrowdStrike\n$\n(19,271)\n$\n89,327 \n$\n(183,245)\n66\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025\n2024\n2023\n%\n%\n%\nRevenue\nSubscription\n95 \n%\n94 \n%\n94 \n%\nProfessional services\n5 \n%\n6 \n%\n6 \n%\nTotal revenue\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nCost of revenue\nSubscription\n21 \n%\n21 \n%\n23 \n%\nProfessional services\n4 \n%\n4 \n%\n4 \n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n25 \n%\n25 \n%\n27 \n%\nGross profit\n75 \n%\n75 \n%\n73 \n%\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing\n39 \n%\n37 \n%\n40 \n%\nResearch and development\n27 \n%\n25 \n%\n27 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n12 \n%\n13 \n%\n14 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n78 \n%\n75 \n%\n82 \n%\nLoss from operations\n(3)\n%\n— \n%\n(8)\n%\nInterest expense\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\nInterest income\n5 \n%\n5 \n%\n2 \n%\nOther income, net\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes\n1 \n%\n4 \n%\n(7)\n%\nProvision for income taxes\n2 \n%\n1 \n%\n1 \n%\nNet income (loss)\n— \n%\n3 \n%\n(8)\n%\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nNet income (loss) attributable to CrowdStrike\n— \n%\n3 \n%\n(8)\n%\nComparison of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024\nRevenue\nThe following shows total revenue from subscriptions and professional services for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024 (in thousands, except percentages):\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nSubscription\n$\n3,761,480 \n$\n2,870,557 \n$\n890,923 \n31 \n%\nProfessional services\n192,144 \n184,998 \n7,146 \n4 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n3,953,624 \n$\n3,055,555 \n$\n898,069 \n29 \n%\nTotal revenue increased by $898.1 million, or 29%, in fiscal 2025, compared to fiscal 2024.

It is not currently possible to reasonably estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties, or other resolution of proceedings resulting from the July 19 Incident. However, despite such uncertainties, we expect that the combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our Revolving Facility matures on January 2, 2026.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) interest and principal payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, (iv) research and development and capital expenditure needs, and (v) license and service arrangements integral to our business operations. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. \n70\nTable of \nContents\nWe have historically generated operating losses prior to fiscal 2024 and during fiscal 2025, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2025. We expect to continue to make investments, particularly in sales and marketing and research and development. As a result, we may require additional capital resources in the future to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business.\nWe generally invoice our subscription customers at the beginning of the subscription term, or in some instances, such as in multi-year arrangements, in installments. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billed fees for our subscriptions, prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition, which are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of January 31, 2025, we had deferred revenue of $3.7 billion, of which $2.7 billion was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. We do not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions, or foreign currency forward contracts.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,381,727 \n$\n1,166,207 \n$\n941,007 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(536,588)\n(340,650)\n(556,658)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n107,208 \n93,158 \n77,437 \nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n947,069 \n920,673 \n460,291 \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 was $1.4 billion, which resulted from net loss of $16.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $1.4 billion and net cash outflow of $6.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $865.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $318.8 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $188.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $26.0 million of amortization of intangibles assets, $15.3 million of non-cash operating lease costs, $3.8 million of non-cash interest expense, and $2.3 million of accretion of short-term investments purchased at a discount, partially offset by $9.9 million of deferred income taxes and $6.3 million of realized gains on strategic investments. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $584.5 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, a $274.2 million increase in accounts receivable, net, a $190.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $15.7 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a $669.3 million increase in deferred revenue, a $218.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an $85.9 million increase in accrued payroll and benefits, and an $84.9 million increase in accounts payable. \nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2024 was $1.2 billion, which resulted from net income of $90.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $1.0 billion and net cash inflow of $51.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $631.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, $238.9 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $126.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $18.4 million of amortization of intangibles assets, $13.4 million of non-cash operating lease costs, and $3.2 million of non-cash interest expense, partially offset by $3.9 million of realized gains on strategic investments and a $3.4 million change in deferred income taxes. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $696.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a $65.1 million increase in accrued payroll and benefits, a $14.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $371.6 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, a $217.7 million increase in accounts receivable, net, a $102.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $18.9 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $14.0 million decrease in operating lease liabilities.\n71\nTable of \nContents\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025 of $536.6 million was primarily due to business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $310.3 million, which was related to the Flow Security and Adaptive Shield acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment of $254.9 million, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs of $59.0 million, purchases of strategic investments of $19.7 million, and purchases of deferred compensation investments of $2.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $97.3 million and proceeds from sales of strategic investments of $12.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2024 of $340.7 million was primarily due to business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $239.0 million, which was related to the Bionic acquisition, purchases of short-term investments of $195.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of $176.5 million, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs of $49.5 million, purchases of strategic investments of $17.2 million, purchases of intangible assets of $11.1 million, and purchases of deferred compensation investments of $2.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of $348.3 million, and proceeds from sales of strategic investments of $2.0 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $107.2 million during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $99.6 million, capital contributions from non-controlling interest holders of $8.5 million, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $4.0 million, partially offset by distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $4.9 million. \nNet cash provided by financing activities of $93.2 million during fiscal 2024 was primarily due to proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $76.4 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8.7 million, and capital contributions from non-controlling interests of $8.1 million.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nOur Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by CrowdStrike, Inc. and CrowdStrike Financial Services, Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (the “subsidiary guarantors,” and together with CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., the “Obligor Group”). The guarantee is full and unconditional and is subject to certain conditions for release. See Note 5, Debt, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a brief description of the Senior Notes.\nWe conduct our operations almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flows and ability to service the notes will depend on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans, or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities will have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.\nSummarized financial information is presented below for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances within the Obligor Group and equity in the earnings from and investments in any non-guarantor subsidiary. The revenue amounts presented in the summarized financial information include substantially all of our consolidated revenue, and there is no intercompany revenue from the non-guarantor subsidiaries. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n72\nTable of \nContents\nStatement of Operations\nYear Ended \nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n3,948,062 \nCost of revenue\n1,022,627 \nOperating expenses\n3,063,076 \nLoss from operations\n(137,641)\nNet loss\n(36,365)\nNet loss attributable to CrowdStrike\n(36,365)\nBalance Sheet\nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in thousands)\nCurrent assets (excluding current intercompany receivables from non-Guarantors)\n$\n5,922,562 \nCurrent intercompany receivables from non-Guarantors\n49,417 \nNoncurrent assets (excluding noncurrent intercompany receivables from non-Guarantors)\n2,316,545 \nNoncurrent intercompany receivables from non-Guarantors\n613,732 \nCurrent liabilities (excluding current intercompany payables to non-Guarantors)\n3,331,647 \nCurrent intercompany payables to non-Guarantors\n31,092 \nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding noncurrent intercompany payables to non-Guarantors)\n1,897,235 \nNoncurrent intercompany payables to non-Guarantors\n234,643 \nStrategic Investments\nIn July 2019, we agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to a newly formed entity, CrowdStrike Falcon Fund LLC (the “Original Falcon Fund”) in exchange for 50% of the sharing percentage of any distribution by the Original Falcon Fund. In December 2021, we agreed to commit an additional $50.0 million to a newly formed entity, CrowdStrike Falcon Fund II LLC (“Falcon Fund II”) in exchange for 50% of the sharing percentage of any distribution by Falcon Fund II. Further, entities associated with Accel also agreed to commit up to $10.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, to the Original Falcon Fund and Falcon Fund II (collectively, the “Falcon Funds”), and collectively own the remaining 50% of the sharing percentage of the Falcon Funds. Both Falcon Funds are in the business of purchasing, selling, and investing in minority equity and convertible debt securities of privately-held companies that develop applications that have potential for substantial contribution to us and our platform. We are the manager of the Falcon Funds and control their investment decisions and day-to-day operations and accordingly have consolidated each of the Falcon Funds. Each Falcon Fund has a duration of ten years and may be extended for three additional years. At dissolution, the Falcon Funds will be liquidated, and the remaining assets will be distributed to the investors based on their respective sharing percentage. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur commitments consist of obligations under non-cancellable real estate arrangements on an undiscounted basis, of which $14.1 million is due in the next 12 months and $35.6 million is due thereafter. In addition, we have debt obligations related to $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due in fiscal 2030 and the interest payments associated with the Senior Notes of $22.5 million due in the next 12 months and $78.8 million due thereafter. We have non-cancellable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase products and services entered in the normal course of business totaling $2.7 billion as of January 31, 2025, with remaining terms in excess of 12 months. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operations and cash on our balance sheet.\nAs of January 31, 2025, our unrecognized tax benefits included $53.1 million, which were classified as long-term liabilities due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits.\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had non-cancellable unfunded commitments from our financing arrangements totaling approximately $94.2 million. \n73\nTable of \nContents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, knowledge of factors affecting our business, and our belief as to what could occur in the future considering available information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe accounting estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained, and our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and, if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these estimates.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue predominately from subscription revenue, which is primarily based on the solutions subscribed to by the customer. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. Our professional services are available through time and material and fixed fee agreements. Revenue from professional services is recognized as services are performed. \nWe enter into revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations in which a customer may purchase combinations of subscriptions, support, training, and consulting service. Judgment is required when considering the terms and conditions of these contracts. The transaction price for these contracts is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell promised subscription or professional services separately to a customer.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangibles assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected customer attrition rates, estimated obsolescence rates, and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\n74\nTable of \nContents\nWe account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We establish a liability for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.\n75\nTable of \nContents",
