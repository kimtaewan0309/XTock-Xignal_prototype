(“PFG”) is a leader in global financial services offering businesses, individuals and institutional clients a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement, asset management and workplace benefits and protection solutions through our diverse family of financial services companies. We had $1,663.9 billion in assets under administration (“AUA”), including $712.1 billion in assets under management (“AUM”) as of December 31, 2024.\nOur global asset management businesses serve a broad range of institutional, retirement, high net worth, and retail investors worldwide. Our focused investment teams provide diverse, long-term investment capabilities including equity, fixed income, real estate, and other alternative investments, as well as fund offerings. Our international asset management and accumulation businesses focus on the opportunities created as aging populations around the world drive increased demand for retirement accumulation, retirement asset management and retirement income management solutions.\nIn the U.S., we offer a broad array of retirement and employee benefit and insurance solutions to meet the needs of the business owner and their employees. We are a leading provider of defined contribution plans, nonqualified plans, defined benefit plans and pension risk transfer services. We are also a leading employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) consultant. In addition, we are one of the largest providers of specialty benefits and insurance solutions for business owners and their employees. We believe small and medium-sized businesses are an underserved market, offering attractive growth opportunities in the retirement and employee benefit markets.\nOur Reportable Segments\nWe organize our businesses into the following reportable segments:\n●\nRetirement and Income Solutions;\n●\nPrincipal Asset Management and\n●\nBenefits and Protection.\nWe also have a Corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we implemented changes to our Principal Asset Management segment to align the global operations by business function. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, our Principal Asset Management segment was organized into Principal Global Investors and Principal International. The Principal Asset Management segment is now organized into Investment Management and International Pension. The change has been applied retrospectively, which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20, Segment Information” for financial results of our segments.\nRetirement and Income Solutions Segment\nOur asset accumulation activities in the U.S. date back to the 1940s when we first began providing pension plan products and services. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for retirement savings along with select products for retirement income:\n●\nTo businesses of all sizes, we offer products and services for defined contribution plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans; defined benefit plans; nonqualified executive benefit plans; stock services, including ESOPs and equity compensation; and pension risk transfer services;\n●\nTo large institutional clients, we also offer investment only products, including guaranteed investment contracts (“GICs”);\n●\nTo employees of businesses and other individuals, we offer the ability to accumulate savings and provide an income stream for retirement and other purposes through mutual funds, individual variable annuities, registered index-linked annuities (“RILAs”) and bank products; and\n●\nTo retirement and non-retirement businesses, we offer trust and custody services.\n​\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWorkplace Savings and Retirement Solutions (“WSRS”)\nWe offer a wide variety of investment and administrative products and services for defined contribution plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans; defined benefit plans; nonqualified executive benefit plans and stock services, including ESOPs and equity compensation.\nProducts\nWSRS products respond to the needs of plan sponsors seeking both administrative and investment services for defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The investment component of both the defined contribution and defined benefit plans may be in the form of a guaranteed account, separate account, a mutual fund offering or a collective investment trust. In addition, defined contribution plan sponsors may also offer their own employer securities as an investment option under the plan.\nWe deliver both administrative and investment services to our defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan customers through annuity contracts, collective investment trusts and mutual funds. Group annuity contracts and collective investment trusts used to fund qualified plans are not required to be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our mutual fund service platform is called Principal Advantage. It is a qualified plan service package based on our series mutual fund, Principal Funds, Inc. (“PFI”). We offer investments covering the full range of stable value, equity, fixed income, real estate and international investment options managed by our Principal Asset Management segment as well as third party asset managers. In addition, WSRS offers plan sponsors trust services through an affiliated trust company.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we provided WSRS products to (a) over 43,000 defined contribution plans including $550.7 billion in assets and covering approximately 11.3 million eligible plan participants, and (b) to over 1,600 defined benefit plans, including $17.3 billion in assets and covering over 404,000 eligible plan participants. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 31% of our WSRS account values were managed by our Principal Asset Management segment, 65% were managed entirely by the third party asset managers that were not under contract to sub-advise a PFG product, 2% were sub-advised and 2% represented employer securities.\nMarkets and Distribution\nWe offer our WSRS products and services to plans, including qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. These products and services are offered to businesses of all sizes including plans sponsored by small and mid-sized businesses, which we believe remains underpenetrated, and large institutional clients. We distribute our WSRS products and services nationally, primarily through a captive retirement services sales force. Retirement services sales representatives are an integral part of the sales process alongside the referring consultant or independent advisor. We compensate retirement services sales representatives through a blend of salary and production-based incentives. We administer, on behalf of the plan, commission or fee payments to independent advisors, consultants and agents.\nIn addition, we have a staff of service and education specialists located across the U.S. These specialists play a key role in the ongoing servicing of plans by providing local services to our customers, such as reviewing plan performance, investment options and plan design; communicating the customers’ needs and feedback to us and helping employees understand the benefits of their plans. The following summarizes our distribution channels:\n●\nWe distribute our annuity-based products through intermediaries who are primarily state licensed individuals.\n●\nPrincipal Advantage platform is targeted at defined contribution plans through broker-dealer distribution channels. Principal Advantage gives us access to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) registered distributors who are not traditional sellers of annuity-based products and broadens opportunities for us in the investment advisor and broker-dealer distribution channels.\n●\nThrough our Retire Secure strategy we provide financial education and other assistance to individual investors who are participants/members of employer-based accumulation solutions to help them achieve financial security.\nWe believe our approach to WSRS plan services distribution, which gives us a targeted sales and service presence, along with our offering of Principal\nÒ\n Total Retirement Solutions differentiates us from many of our competitors. We have also established a number of marketing and distribution relationships to increase the sales of our products and services.\n​\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndividual Variable Annuities and RILAs\nIndividual variable annuities and RILAs, which are savings vehicles through which the customer makes one or more deposits of varying amounts and intervals, are offered to individuals.\nProducts\nOur individual variable deferred annuities provide customers with the flexibility to allocate their deposits to mutual funds managed by the Principal Asset Management segment or unaffiliated third party asset managers, with variable and guaranteed options. Generally speaking, the customers bear the investment risk for the variable options and have the right to allocate their assets among various separate mutual funds. The value of the annuity fluctuates in accordance with the experience of the mutual funds chosen by the customer. Customers have the option to allocate all or a portion of their account to our guaranteed option, in which case we credit interest at rates we determine, subject to contractual minimums. As of December 31, 2024, of our $8.3 billion variable annuity account balances invested in mutual funds, 90% was allocated to mutual funds managed by the Principal Asset Management segment and our guaranteed option. The remaining balance was allocated to mutual funds managed by unaffiliated third party asset managers.\nCustomers may elect a living benefit guarantee (commonly known in the industry as a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or “GMWB”). We bear the GMWB investment risk. Our goal is to hedge the GMWB investment risk through the use of sophisticated risk management techniques. As of December 31, 2024, $5.6 billion of the $8.3 billion of variable annuity separate account values had the GMWB rider. Our major source of revenue from individual variable annuities is mortality and expense fees we charge to the customer, generally determined as a percentage of the market value of the assets held in a separate investment sub-account. Account balances of variable annuity contracts with the GMWB rider were invested in separate account investment options as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n \n(in millions)\n​\nBalanced funds\n​\n$\n 5,411.5\n​\n$\n 6,272.4\n​\nEquity funds\n​\n \n 125.9\n​\n \n 140.1\n​\nBond funds\n​\n \n 41.1\n​\n \n 59.0\n​\nMoney market funds\n​\n \n 17.0\n​\n \n 12.6\n​\nSpecialty funds\n​\n \n 0.6\n​\n \n 0.7\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 5,596.1\n​\n$\n 6,484.8\n​\nPercent of total variable annuity separate account values\n​\n \n 67\n%  \n \n 71\n%\n​\nIn addition, we offer RILAs, which provide policyholders with index-linked investment options and a fixed interest investment option, with different available term lengths. The index-linked investment options minimize negative index performance through floors or buffers. Customers may elect a GMWB. We bear the GMWB investment risk. Our goal is to hedge the GMWB investment risk through the use of risk management techniques.\nMarkets and Distribution\nOur target markets for individual variable annuities and RILAs include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses and individuals seeking to accumulate and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market variable annuities and RILAs to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings.\nWe sell our individual variable annuity products and RILAs primarily through our affiliated financial representatives, who accounted for 70%, 85% and 87% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining sales were made primarily through unaffiliated broker-dealer firms.\nInvestment Only\nProducts\nThe two primary products for which we provide investment only services are GICs and funding agreements.\nGICs and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDeposits to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. The amounts earned by us are derived in part from the difference between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. The Principal Asset Management segment manages the assets supporting the contractual promises.\nMarkets and Distribution\nFunding agreements are issued directly to non-qualified institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“FHLB Des Moines”) and unconsolidated special purpose entities. As part of our funding agreement-backed note programs, U.S. and foreign institutional investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose entity which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another.\nPension Risk Transfer\nProducts\nPension risk transfer products respond primarily to the needs of pension plan sponsors in the form of single premium group annuities, which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. The majority of our business originates from defined benefit plans that are being terminated. In these situations, the plan sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor (“DOL”) has mandated that annuities be purchased only from the “safest available” insurers.\nSince premium received from pension risk transfer products is generally in the form of single payments, the level of premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of large-scale annuity sales in a particular quarter. The Principal Asset Management segment manages the assets supporting pension risk transfer account values.\nMarkets and Distribution\nOur primary distribution channel for pension risk transfer products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants working through consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales representatives act as a secondary distribution channel for these products.\nBank and Trust Services\nPrincipal Bank is a U.S. federal savings bank that was formed in February 1998. As of December 31, 2024, Principal Bank had nearly 772,000 customers and approximately $8.8 billion in assets.

Principal Bank offers Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured cash solutions for customers in the form of savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. The deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity for Principal Bank and are backed by purchases of investment securities and residential mortgage loans. In addition, Principal Bank serves as a trustee and/or custodian for institutional customers within its PCS division and facilitates cash sweep services for these customers as well as cash sweep services for customers of affiliates.\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Trust Company provides a variety of comprehensive trust and administrative solutions for employee benefits plans and personal trusts.

For additional information, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 24, Subsequent Event.”\nBenefits and Protection Segment\nOur Benefits and Protection segment activities date back to 1879 when we first began selling individual life insurance products. We expanded our offering to include group insurance products in the 1940s and have continued to expand our product portfolio over time. We are uniquely positioned to protect businesses through our broad set of solutions, our expertise and the experiences we offer.\n●\nWe protect their employees by offering a comprehensive set of employee benefits that helps recruit and retain talent including nonqualified deferred compensation, employer paid and voluntary group benefits, and guaranteed standard issue life and individual disability insurance.\n●\nWe protect their business in the event of a death, disability or resignation of a key employee or future change in management through business owner solutions and disability solutions.\n●\nWe protect business owners and their personal needs by helping maintain their lifestyle through life or disability insurance and building and protecting their retirement savings.\nWe organize our operations into two divisions: Specialty Benefits and Life Insurance. However, we share key resources in our core areas such as strategic leadership, distribution, operations and marketing.\nSpecialty Benefits\nSpecialty Benefits, which includes group dental, vision, life, critical illness, accident, hospital indemnity, paid family and medical leave (“PFML”), disability insurance and individual disability insurance, is an important component of the employee benefit offering primarily at small and medium-sized businesses.\nProducts and Services\nGroup Dental and Vision Insurance.\n Our plans provide partial reimbursement for dental and vision expenses. As of December 31, 2024, we had over 123,000 group dental and vision insurance policies in force covering over 3.0 million employees. According to Life Insurance and Market Research Association (“LIMRA”), we were the 3rd largest group dental insurer in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force in 2023. In addition to indemnity and preferred provider organization dental offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis, we offer a prepaid dental plan in Arizona through our Employers Dental Services, Inc. subsidiary. We also offer a discount dental product nationally. Our indemnity vision and our managed care vision products are offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis.\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGroup Life and Other Insurance.\n Our group life insurance provides coverage to employees and their dependents for a specified period. As of December 31, 2024, we had over 99,000 group policies providing nearly $186 billion of group life insurance in force covering approximately 3.1 million employee lives. According to LIMRA, in 2023, we were ranked 1st in the U.S. in terms of the number of group life insurance contracts in force. We currently sell traditional group life insurance that does not provide for accumulation of cash values on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. Our group life insurance business remains focused on the traditional, annually renewable term product. Group term life and group universal life accounted for 99% and 1%, respectively, of our total group life insurance in force as of December 31, 2024. We no longer market group universal life insurance to new employer groups. We sell PFML on a limited basis, which provides paid time off to care for specified family needs or an employee’s own serious health condition. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold PFML in three states. We plan to expand to other states in the future. We also offer voluntary critical illness insurance, which provides a lump-sum benefit to pay for additional expenses associated with common critical illnesses; voluntary accident insurance, which pays a lump sum benefit when covered injuries occur because of an accident; and hospital indemnity insurance, which provides a lump sum benefit associated with hospitalization.\nGroup Disability Insurance.\n Our group disability insurance provides benefits to insured employees who become disabled. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly or weekly income. Our group disability products include both short-term and long-term disability, offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. As of December 31, 2024, long-term disability represented 59% of total group disability premium, while short-term disability represented 41% of total group disability premium. We also provide disability management services, called rehabilitation services, to assist individuals in returning to work as quickly as possible following disability. We work with disability claimants to improve the approval rate of Social Security benefits, thereby reducing payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received. As of December 31, 2024, we served approximately 2.2 million employee lives through over 69,000 contracts. According to LIMRA, our group short-term disability business was ranked 4th and our group long-term disability business was ranked 2nd in the U.S. as of December 31, 2023, in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force.\nIndividual Disability Insurance.\n Individual disability insurance has been sold since the early 1950s. Our individual disability insurance products provide income protection to the insured member and/or business in the event of disability. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. In addition to income replacement, we offer products to pay business-related costs such as overhead expenses for a disabled business owner, buy-out costs for business owners purchasing a disabled owner’s interest in the business, expenditures for replacement of a key person and business loan payments. We also offer a product to protect retirement savings in the event of disability. As of December 31, 2024, we served approximately 219,000 individual disability policyholders. According to LIMRA, our individual disability business was ranked 4th in the U.S. in terms of premium in force in the non-cancellable segment of the market and 4th overall, as of December 31, 2023.\nFee-for-Service.\n We offer administration of group dental, disability and vision benefits on a fee-for-service basis.\nLife Insurance\nWe specialize in providing solutions primarily for small to medium-sized businesses to protect against risk and loss, assist with succession planning and wealth transfer and to build and protect wealth for retirement. We also provide solutions to meet the personal needs of business owners, executives and key employees. In 2021, we narrowed our focus to the business market and ceased sales to the retail consumer market. In 2022, we reinsured our universal life with secondary guarantee (“ULSG”) block of business. Our U.S. operations administered approximately 716,000 individual life insurance policies with over $555.0 billion of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2024.\nProducts and Services\nOur Business Owner Solutions platform as well as our nonqualified deferred compensation offering combines administration and consulting to service our clients’ needs. We focus on the business and personal insurance needs of owners, executives and key employees primarily of small and medium-sized businesses with an emphasis on providing insurance solutions for nonqualified executive benefits. We no longer market our products to retail customers. We offer a variety of individual life insurance products, both interest sensitive (including universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance) and traditional.\nInterest Sensitive.\n Interest sensitive includes universal life (“UL”), variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance products; however, we no longer market universal life insurance with lifetime secondary guarantee provisions. These products offer the policyholder the option of adjusting both the premium and the death benefit amounts of the insurance contract. Universal life insurance typically includes a cash value account that accumulates at a credited interest rate based on the investment returns of the block of business. Variable universal life insurance is credited with the investment returns of the various investment options selected by the policyholder. Indexed universal life is credited with investment returns tied to an external index, subject to a contractual minimum and maximum. For the year ended December 31, 2024, interest sensitive products represented 18% of individual life insurance in force and generated 72% of individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales.\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAfter a deduction for policy level expenses, we credit net deposits to an account maintained for the policyholder. For universal life contracts, the entire account balance is invested in the general account. Interest is credited to the policyholder’s account based on the earnings on general account investments, subject to contractual minimums. For variable universal life contracts, the policyholder may allocate the account balance among our general account and a variety of separate accounts underlying the contract. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the general account in the same manner as for universal life. Net investment performance on separate accounts is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts; the policyholder bears the investment risk. For indexed universal life, the policyholder may allocate the account balance among our general account and two index accounts. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the general account in the same manner as for universal life. Net investment performance on the index accounts is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts, subject to the contractual minimum and maximum. Some of our interest sensitive contracts contain what are commonly referred to as “secondary” or “no-lapse” guarantee provisions. These no-lapse guarantees keep the contract in force, even if the policyholder’s account balance is insufficient to cover all of the contract charges, provided that the policyholder has continually paid a specified minimum premium.\nTraditional Life Insurance.\n Traditional life insurance includes term, whole and adjustable life insurance products; however, we no longer market whole and adjustable life insurance products. Term insurance products provide a guaranteed death benefit for a specified period of time in return for the payment of a fixed premium. Term life insurance products represented 80% of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2024, and 28% of our individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. Whole life policies provide a guaranteed death benefit and a cash surrender value in return for payment of fixed premiums. Adjustable life insurance products provide a guaranteed benefit in return for the payment of a fixed premium while allowing the policyholder to set the coverage period, premium and face amount combination.\nBenefits and Protection Markets and Distribution\nFor each of our products, administration and distribution channels are customized to meet customer needs and expectations for that product.\nWe market our group insurance products primarily to small and medium-sized businesses, through brokers and consultants. We sell our group insurance products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We continually adapt our products and pricing to meet local market conditions and to comply with state and federal legislation. We market our fee-for-service capabilities to employers that self-insure their employees’ dental, disability and vision benefits. We market our fee-for-service businesses in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe group insurance market continues to see a shift to voluntary/worksite products due to various pressures on employers. In keeping with this market change, which shifts the funding of such products from the employer to the employee, we continue to place an enhanced focus on our voluntary benefits platform. We believe the voluntary/worksite market presents growth opportunities and we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 145 sales representatives and 187 service representatives in 26 local markets. Our sales representatives accounted for 100% of our group insurance sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. The service representatives play a key role in servicing the case by providing local, responsive services to our customers and their brokers, such as renewing contracts, revising plans, solving administrative issues and communicating the customers’ needs and feedback to us.\nWe sell our individual life and individual disability insurance products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily targeting owners, executives and key employees of small and medium-sized businesses. Small and medium-sized business sales represented 100% of individual life sales and 71% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our life insurance sales efforts focus on the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation and the Business Solutions market. This strategy offers solutions to address business owner financial challenges such as exiting the business, business transition, retaining key employees and retirement planning. Key employees also have needs to supplement retirement income, survivor income and business protection. We believe the Business Owner Solutions segment offers growth opportunities and we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.\nWe distribute our individual life and individual disability insurance products through our affiliated financial representatives and independent brokers, as well as other marketing and distribution alliances. To meet the needs of the various marketing channels, particularly the independent brokers, we employ wholesale distributors — Regional Vice Presidents for nonqualified, business solutions and individual disability.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Segment\nOur Corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including financing costs), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. Results of Principal Securities, Inc., our retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, and our exited group medical and long-term care insurance businesses are reported in this segment.\nCompetition\nCompetition is based on several factors including customer segments, product types and features, external peer comparisons, go-to-market strategies, compensation structure, price, performance, capital markets, capital liquidity and financial strength ratings. We compete with many financial services companies, such as banks, mutual funds, institutional trust companies, broker-dealers, insurers, recordkeepers, asset managers and wealth managers. Some of these companies may offer a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution sources, better brand recognition or, with respect to insurers, higher financial strength ratings. Some may have greater financial resources with which to compete or have better investment performance at various times. We distinguish ourselves from our competitors through three positional advantages:\n●\nour privileged customer access through small and midsized businesses, retirement ecosystem and global asset management;\n●\nour extensive solutions and expertise integrated within and across our business segments; and\n●\nour focus on attractive markets.\nRatings\nInsurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders. Financial strength ratings are generally defined as opinions as to an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Information about ratings provides both industry participants and insurance consumers meaningful insights on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims.\nPrincipal Life and Principal National Life Insurance Company (“PNLIC”) have been assigned the following insurer financial strength ratings:\n​\nRating Agency\n    \nFinancial Strength Rating\n    \nRating Structure\n \nA.M. Best Company, Inc.\n​\nA+ (“Superior”) with a stable outlook\n​\nSecond highest of 13 rating levels\n​\nFitch Ratings Ltd.\n​\nAA− (“Very Strong”) with a stable outlook\n​\nFourth highest of 19 rating levels\n​\nMoody’s Investors Service\n​\nA1 (“Good”) with a stable outlook\n​\nFifth highest of 21 rating levels\n​\nS&P Global Ratings\n​\nA+ (“Strong”) with a stable outlook\n​\nFifth highest of 20 rating levels\n​\n​\nA.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) ratings for insurance companies range from “A++” to “S”. A.M. Best indicates that “A++” and “A+” ratings are assigned to those companies that in A.M. Best’s opinion have superior ability to meet ongoing insurance obligations. Fitch Ratings Ltd. (“Fitch”) ratings for insurance companies range from “AAA” to “C”. Fitch “AA” ratings indicate very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) ratings for insurance companies range from “Aaa” to “C”. Moody’s indicates that “A” ratings are assigned to those companies that offer good financial security. S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) has ratings that range from “AAA” to “D” for insurance companies. S&P indicates that “A” ratings are assigned to those companies that have strong financial security characteristics. In evaluating a company’s financial and operating performance, these rating agencies review its profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its policy reserves, the soundness of its risk management programs, the experience and competency of its management and other factors.\nWe believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers, as ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. Our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security, including our common stock. For more information on ratings, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financial Strength and Credit Ratings.”\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRegulation\nOur businesses are subject to regulation and supervision by U.S. federal, state and broker dealer regulatory authorities as well as non-U.S. regulatory authorities for our operations and customers outside the U.S. Our businesses are also subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax laws as well as tax laws for jurisdictions outside the U.S. As we continue to expand our global footprint, we are subject to laws and regulations of jurisdictions where we register and sell products, even if we do not have a physical operating presence.\nPFG, our parent holding company, is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it is the holding company for our collective operations, it is subject to regulation in connection with our regulated entities, including as an insurance holding company. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to public companies, including public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting and corporate governance.\nU.S. Insurance Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance companies are domiciled. Principal Life and PNLIC are domiciled in Iowa and their principal insurance regulatory authority is the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. These laws require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company system. Transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and at arm’s length. Most states have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change in control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company and laws that require prior notification to state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state.\nAnnually, our U.S. insurance companies must submit an opinion from a board-appointed qualified actuary to state insurance regulators, where licensed, on whether the statutory assets backing statutory reserves are sufficient to meet contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be rendered noting the sufficiency of assets, the insurance company must set up additional statutory reserves drawing from available statutory surplus until such an opinion can be given.\nState insurance departments have broad administrative powers over the insurance business, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent licensing, establishment of reserve requirements and solvency standards, premium rate regulation, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, policy form approval, unfair trade and claims practices regulation and other matters. State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further details.\nTo enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has established risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards. The standards require life insurers to report annually to state regulators regarding their RBC based upon categories of risk including the following: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business and operational risk. As of December 31, 2024, the statutory surplus of each of our U.S. life insurance companies exceeded the minimum RBC requirements.\nThe following authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding our compliance with applicable laws and regulations:\n●\nstate and federal insurance regulatory authorities;\n●\nstate and federal securities regulatory authorities;\n●\nfederal agencies, such as the DOL;\n●\nstate law enforcement agencies and \n●\nstate attorneys general.\nEach state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, to cover contractual benefit obligations of insolvent insurance companies. The guaranty associations of each state levy assessments on member insurers doing business in their states based on the proportionate share of the premiums written by such insurer in the lines of business in which the insolvent insurer is engaged. Some states permit the member insurers to recover the assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Executive Orders\nThe President of the United States manages the operations of the Executive branch of Government through Executive orders. As a U.S.-based business, we are subject to certain Executive orders that could affect our business, operations, regional footprint, risk management strategies and investments and increase our costs of compliance.\nSecurities Regulation\nInsurance and investment products that require registration with the SEC, such as variable annuities, RILA, variable life insurance and some funding agreements that constitute securities and mutual fund products are subject to securities laws and regulations, including U.S. state securities regulation as well as U.S. federal regulation under the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory authorities. These regulations affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products and the compliance oversight construct.\nWe also have entities that are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under, and are therefore subject to, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act\nAs we provide products and services for U.S. and Puerto Rico employee benefit plans, we are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure requirements and standards of conduct.\nBanking Regulation\nPrincipal Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a U.S. federal savings bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Principal Bank’s depositors are insured by the FDIC up to specified limits, making Principal Bank subject to certain of the FDIC’s regulations.\nTrust Regulation\nDelaware Charter Guarantee & Trust Company conducting business as Principal Trust Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a Delaware state-chartered trust company regulated by the State of Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner. Principal Trust Company is subject to Delaware banking and trust law.\nPrincipal Global Investors Trust Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, is an Oregon state registered banking corporation with trust powers regulated by the State of Oregon Division of Financial Regulations. Principal Global Investors Trust Company is subject to Oregon banking regulations.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nAs we own and operate real property, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, as well as international environmental laws and could be subject to environmental liabilities and costs associated with required remediation of our properties. We routinely have environmental assessments performed for real estate being acquired or used as collateral for commercial mortgages we use for investment.\nRegulation of International Businesses\nOur international businesses are supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including regulation and supervision by insurance, securities, tax and privacy regulatory authorities. The purpose of these regulations aligns with the purpose and intent of U.S. regulations and is primarily focused on consumer protection and prudency of the overall financial system.\n​\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisk Management\nLike all financial services companies, we are exposed to a wide variety of financial, operational and other risks, as described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” Our enterprise risk management approach enables us to have the right people, culture, tools, knowledge, information, processes and controls in place to effectively identify, measure, monitor, communicate and manage risks within established limits and tolerances helping us:\n●\nIdentify and successfully manage risks that present profitable growth opportunities and avoid those that don’t. \n●\nBalance the sometimes-competing demands of various constituencies; meet our customer obligations, satisfy regulatory requirements and optimize shareholder returns relative to the risks we take.\nWe utilize an integrated risk management framework to help us identify, analyze and mitigate internal and external risks. The framework delivers important perspective used in strategic and tactical decision making and is adaptable to changes in our businesses and the external environments in which we operate. We are committed to continuous improvement and ongoing validation.\nOur governance structure includes Board of Directors (“Board”) oversight, internal risk committees, an enterprise risk management function and dedicated risk professionals with expertise representing each business area. The Board and its committees, which include Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Human Resources Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, provide oversight no less frequently than quarterly, addressing relevant aspects of our risk profile.\nOur internal risk committees meet regularly to facilitate the management of issues and review the risk profile of their responsibilities. Each business area and functional area has its own committee responsible for oversight of the material risks within the area. We also have internal committees that provide oversight around certain types of risks across the organization. This matrix approach helps maintain comprehensive risk coverage and preserve an integrated view of risks. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee, comprised of members from the Executive Management Group (“EMG”), exercises enterprise-wide oversight for the most significant risk profiles.\nBusiness areas and functional areas have primary responsibility for identifying, assessing, monitoring, reporting and managing their own risks. Our enterprise risk management staff (independent of the business areas) work closely with the dedicated risk professionals aligned to the business areas and functional areas to provide objective oversight, framework enablement and aggregated risk analysis. This results in a model where risk management can be closer to actual risks while also facilitating effective oversight and consolidation at the enterprise level.\nInternal Audit provides independent, risk-based objective assurance and advice designed to add value and improve our operations. It helps us accomplish our objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, internal control and governance processes; and by promoting continuous improvement. The Chief Internal Auditor reports functionally to the Board Audit Committee and administratively to our Chief Risk Officer.\nRisk appetites, tolerances and limits have been established from an enterprise-wide and business area perspective for specific risk categories, where appropriate. We monitor a variety of risk metrics on an ongoing basis and take appropriate steps to manage our established risk appetites and tolerances. Quarterly risk reporting provides a feedback loop between business areas, functional areas, our internal risk committees and the enterprise risk management function. This reporting also includes perspectives on emerging risk. To the extent potentially significant business activities or operational initiatives are considered, analysis of the possible impact on our risk profile takes place. This analysis includes, but is not limited to, the capital implications; the impact on near term and long-term earnings; the ability to meet our targets with respect to return on equity, liquidity, debt/capital, cash coverage, business risk and operational risk; and the impact to our reputation.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 19,700 people across the globe, including approximately 12,000 employees who work in the U.S. and 7,700 employees who work outside the U.S. Our employees work from many locations across multiple businesses and are united through a common purpose: to help more people and businesses around the world gain greater access to financial security. We begin by listening to our customers to understand their needs, goals and barriers. From there, we leverage our global expertise to provide personalized insights, financial tools and resources to create opportunities for more people to save, invest and protect their financial futures. Our purpose provides a foundation for attracting, retaining and developing a workforce motivated by quality employment and purposeful work.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, our commitment to enabling high performing teams remained strong. We continued to attract, retain and develop the talent needed to deliver our enterprise strategy. Our talent initiatives focus on fostering a caring community, enabling a tailored approach to life and work, providing meaningful work and granting access to boundless opportunity across the enterprise. Grounded in a clear and compelling employee value proposition, we are confident in our ability to build inclusive teams with the global talent necessary to succeed.\nWe invest in employee development in several ways, including experiential learning, growth assignments, relationships with colleagues, formal programming and just-in-time resources. We have an enterprise learning platform that allows us to curate learning content aligned with enterprise priorities to ensure employees have the skills necessary to contribute to our success now and into the future. These investments also ensure our employees can develop the skills most critical to their current and future career aspirations. We continue to pilot new programs to create the space for employees to learn new skills and navigate their career. Additional targeted development opportunities exist for leaders and employees identified as high potential talent. \nWe know an inclusive culture makes us stronger, and we remain committed to providing a work environment where every employee feels welcomed, is respected and has an opportunity to thrive. We are committed to providing our leaders across the globe with regular training, with the goal of establishing more productive connections between teams and enabling thoughtful decision-making. As of December 31, 2024, we had eight employee resource groups (“ERGs”), comprised of employees motivated to listen, reflect and provide cultural insights. Our ERGs, which are open to all employees, play an integral role in providing insights into our products, services, workplace and community. In 2024, our global mentoring program continued, enabling colleagues from around the world to build relationships, support and educate each other. In addition, at our Global Inclusion Summit, senior executives and employees hosted sessions on a variety of inclusion-related topics. \nIn 2024, we measured in multiple ways the progress of our efforts to attract and retain employees with a variety of lived experiences and perspectives. We also surveyed employees about their sense of belonging and reported the results through our Global People Inclusion Index. On an annual basis we partner with an external consultant to conduct a global pay equity study; we believe the results of this study place us in a best-in-class category as compared to financial services industry peers. \nWe continuously strive to evolve our human capital policies and processes. To better understand and improve upon talent trends, we use an enterprise people scorecard, where we report employee data and insights on retention, learning, hiring, engagement and productivity. In 2024 we provided company-wide exit surveys to departing employees and their leaders, enabling us to better understand turnover trends and rationales. Leaders conducted proactive employee stay conversations and quarterly performance check-ins. In addition, we actively monitored our Engagement Index, which is a clear indicator of employee engagement across the organization. These tools allowed us to gather insights and create actions to manage turnover, including tailored development opportunities and compensation increases for roles in high demand. Our customer focus, commitment to ethical practices, continuous learning opportunities and inclusive environment drive a strong culture where employees can thrive.\nThe following table provides retention data for our employee workforce as of December 31, 2024.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nGlobal\n    \nU.S.\n \nAverage tenure, continuous years of service (1)\n \n 8.8\n \n 11.2\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAnnual turnover rate\n \n 17.4\n%  \n 11.0\n%\n(1)\nContinuous years of service represents the number of years employed by us as of December 31, 2024.\nOur competitive total rewards offerings are critical components of our employee value proposition. The programs for the broader employee population include our employee stock purchase plan and our annual incentive program. For select roles, we offer a long-term incentive plan, which is a stock-based compensation plan. Critical talent and high performing employees are eligible to receive stock awards under our discretionary stock program. Retirement programming for U.S. employees includes eligibility for our 401(k) plan, with a robust company match. Additionally, employees outside our asset management business are eligible to participate in a cash balance defined benefit plan. Outside the U.S., retirement programming varies by country and commonly exceeds statutory requirements. We also offer employees a comprehensive suite of health and welfare benefits, designed to offer support through all stages of their career and life. We put special emphasis on employee wellbeing by offering a wide range of programming aimed at improving overall health, including a state-of-the-art wellness center at our global headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, and gym reimbursement at other locations. \n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to providing competitive total rewards, we provide our global workforce with a myriad of opportunities to support their communities and the causes important to them. We encourage in-person and virtual volunteerism through our volunteer time off policy. As an example of this, at the Community Learning Center housed at our global headquarters, employees have ready access to a variety of volunteer opportunities, including the ability to mentor students, provide professional development coaching and teach future ready job skills such as coding. A generous Dollars for Doers program provides employees a microgrant credit based on volunteer hours they record in our Corporate Social Responsibility platform, enabling employees to contribute earned credits to any nonprofit they choose. We also offer a giving program through which Principal® Foundation provides a 50% match on employee monetary contributions, with the match going directly to the organization to which the employee has donated.\nInternet Website\nOur internet website can be found at www.principal.com. We make available free of charge, on or through our internet website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC.

  "item7": "Item \n7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following analysis discusses our financial condition as of December 31, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nFor information and analysis relating to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nForward-Looking Information\nOur narrative analysis below contains forward-looking statements intended to enhance the reader’s ability to assess our future financial performance. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and contain words and phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are made based upon management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.\nActual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors listed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nWe provide financial products and services through the following reportable segments:\n●\nRetirement and Income Solutions;\n●\nPrincipal Asset Management and\n●\nBenefits and Protection.\nWe also have a Corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment. See Item 1. “Business” for a description of our reportable segments.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we implemented changes to our Principal Asset Management segment to align the global operations by business function. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, our Principal Asset Management segment was organized into Principal Global Investors and Principal International. The Principal Asset Management segment is now organized into Investment Management and International Pension. The change has been applied retrospectively, which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEconomic Factors and Trends\nPositive market performance led to an increase in account values in our Retirement and Income Solutions segment in 2024. Since account values are the base by which this business generates revenues, market performance volatility may impact our revenues in future quarters.\nPositive market performance led to an increase in AUM in our Principal Asset Management segment in 2024, which was partially offset by foreign currency headwinds. Since AUM is the base by which this business generates revenues, market performance and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our revenues in future quarters. Also included in revenues are borrower fees, transaction fees and performance fees, which can fluctuate between years.\nIn our Benefits and Protection segment, premium and fee growth is a key indicator of earnings growth. Higher levels of unemployment may impact new sales in our businesses and reduce in-group growth in our Specialty Benefits business in the short-term.\n​\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProfitability\nOur profitability depends in large part upon our amount of AUM and our ability to:\n●\nmanage the difference between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to policyholders;\n●\ngenerate fee revenues by providing trust and custody, administrative and investment management services;\n●\nprice our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the related expenses;\n●\nmanage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of invested assets;\n●\neffectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates on certain transactions and\n●\nmanage our operating expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.” We have identified critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader’s ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates and changes in guidance. The identification, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Board Audit Committee.\nValuation and Allowance for Credit Loss of Fixed Income Investments\nFixed Maturities.\n Fixed maturities include bonds, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. We classify our fixed maturities as either AFS or trading and, accordingly, carry them at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. Volatility in net income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading. Volatility in other comprehensive income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as AFS.\nWe measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset, or nonperformance risk, including our own credit risk. For additional details concerning the methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” under the caption, “Determination of Fair Value.”\nThe fair values of our public fixed maturities are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors. We have regular interactions with these vendors to ensure we understand their pricing methodologies and to confirm they are utilizing observable market information. In addition, 16% of our invested asset portfolio as of December 31, 2024, was invested in privately placed fixed maturities with no readily available market quotes to determine the fair market value. The majority of these assets are valued using a matrix pricing valuation approach that utilizes observable market inputs. In the matrix approach, securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by sector, rating and average life. Each pricing category is assigned a risk spread based on observable public market data. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. Although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may be impacted by company specific factors. This excludes privately placed securities subject to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 that are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors, similar to public fixed maturities.\nIf we are unable to price a fixed maturity security using prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources specific to the asset class, we may obtain a broker quote or utilize an internal pricing model specific to the asset utilizing relevant market information, to the extent available and where at least one significant unobservable input is utilized. In addition, there may be certain securities managed by external managers where we obtain the valuation from the external manager when we are unable to obtain prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources. These are reflected in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and can include fixed maturities across all asset classes. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 3% of our total fixed maturities were Level 3 securities valued using internal pricing models. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion.\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe $227.0 million increase in net unrealized losses from U.S. investment operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, can primarily be attributed to an increase in interest rates, which was partially offset by a tightening of credit spreads. For additional information about interest rate risk see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nWe have a process in place to identify fixed maturity securities that could potentially require an allowance for credit loss. This process involves monitoring market events that could impact issuers’ credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors. This process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.\nEach reporting period, all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether a decline in value is due to credit. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent the fair value is below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events and (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows. To the extent we determine an unrealized loss is due to credit, an allowance for credit loss is recognized through a reduction to net income. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Allowance for Credit Loss” for further discussion.\nA number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit losses and determining the allowance for credit loss. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer’s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. As of December 31, 2024, we had $46,367.3 million in AFS fixed maturities with gross unrealized losses totaling $6,475.2 million. Included in the gross unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as movement in credit spreads.\nFor more detailed information concerning allowances for credit loss, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Allowance for Credit Loss.”\nMortgage Loans.\n Mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. Commercial mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. We establish a valuation allowance for the risk of credit losses inherent in our mortgage loans, which is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated expected credit losses. The valuation allowance is based on amortized cost excluding accrued interest receivable and includes reserves for pools of financing receivables with similar risk characteristics. Amounts on loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and removed from the valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance provision is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations.\nFor more detailed information concerning mortgage loan valuation allowances, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables Valuation Allowance.”\nDerivatives\nWe use derivatives primarily to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks. The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are determined through quoted market prices. Exchange-traded derivatives include futures that are settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. The fair values of privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, that are cleared through centralized clearinghouses are determined through market prices published by the clearinghouses. Variation margin associated with OTC cleared derivatives is settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. The fair values of non-cleared OTC derivatives are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market observable inputs or broker quotes. On an absolute fair value basis as of December 31, 2024, the majority of our OTC derivative assets and liabilities were valued using pricing valuation models using market observable data with approximately 3% using broker quotes. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion. The fair values of our derivative instruments can be impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity indices and volatility, as well as other contributing factors. For additional information see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe also issue certain annuity, universal life and other contracts that include embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the host contract. They are valued using a combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion. We include our assumption for own nonperformance risk in the valuation of these embedded derivatives. As our credit spreads widen or tighten, the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities decrease or increase, leading to an increase or decrease in net income. If the current market credit spreads reflecting our own creditworthiness move to zero (tighten), the reduction to net income would be approximately $35.1 million, net of income taxes, based on December 31, 2024, reported amounts. In addition, the policyholder behavior assumptions used in the valuation of embedded derivatives include risk margins, which increase the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities.\nWe have entered into coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements. For funds withheld agreements the economic benefit of the assets flow to reinsurance counterparties, however, we retain legal ownership of the assets within the funds withheld account. Therefore, the assets held under funds withheld agreements are included on our consolidated statements of financial position, with a corresponding funds withheld payable. The funds withheld payable also includes an embedded derivative that has been bifurcated from the host contract. The fair value of the embedded derivative is based on the change in the fair value of the underlying funds withheld investments using the valuation methods and assumptions described for our investments held.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the applicable accounting standards continue to evolve. Judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment. Judgment and estimates are used to determine the fair value of some of our derivatives. Volatility in net income can result from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting and changes in fair value of embedded derivatives.\nMarket Risk Benefits\nMRBs are contracts or contract features that provide protection to the policyholder from capital market risk such as equity, interest rate or foreign exchange risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk. We have certain annuity and other investment contracts that have GMWB and GMDB riders or a guarantee on the minimum account balance under certain qualifying events. These MRBs have been bifurcated from the host contract and are measured at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized in net income, with the exception of the change in fair value related to our own nonperformance risk, which is recognized in OCI. We use various derivative instruments to hedge against changes in fair value of MRBs related to market risk.\nMRBs are valued using a combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Market Risk Benefits and Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion. We include our assumption for own nonperformance risk in the valuation of these MRBs, which is based on the current market credit spreads for debt-like instruments we have issued and are available in the market. As our credit spreads widen or tighten, the fair value of MRB assets increase or decrease and the fair value of MRB liabilities decrease or increase, leading to an increase or decrease in OCI, respectively. If the current market credit spreads reflecting our own creditworthiness move to zero (tighten), the reduction to OCI would be approximately $42.0 million, net of income taxes, based on December 31, 2024, reported amounts. In addition, the policyholder behavior assumptions used in the valuation of MRBs include risk margins, which decrease the fair value of MRB assets and increase the fair value of MRB liabilities.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We formally conduct our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during the third quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not create an impairment. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment.\nAnnual goodwill impairment testing consists of qualitative or quantitative assessments. In the qualitative assessment, we assess relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. If when reviewing the qualitative factors it is determined it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe determination of fair value for our reporting units is primarily based on an income approach whereby we use discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. We apply significant judgment to our discounted cash flow models when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will in all likelihood differ in some responses from actual future results.\nThe key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value include:\n●\nweighted average cost of capital\n●\nlong-term growth rate\n●\ncorporate income tax rate\n●\nAUM growth rate\n●\nnet revenue growth rate\n●\nbusiness margins on AUM and net revenue\nFor reporting units that performed a qualitative test of goodwill, we concluded the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. Similarly, for reporting units that performed a quantitative test of goodwill, the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nFor information about our goodwill and other intangible assets, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies,” and “Note 2, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”\nSensitivities.\n In connection with our annual impairment testing process, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. We cannot predict certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets that totaled $1,549.7 million and $1,389.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, interest rate movements, declines in the equity markets, the legal environment in which the businesses operate or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers.\nInsurance Reserves\nReserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due, at some point in the future, to or on behalf of our policyholders. U.S. GAAP, allowing for some degree of managerial judgment, provides guidance for establishing reserves.\nFuture policy benefits and claims include reserves for individual traditional life insurance, disability insurance and individual and group annuities that provide periodic income payments. These reserves are computed using assumptions of mortality, interest, morbidity and lapse. These assumptions are based on our experience, industry results, emerging trends and future expectations.\nFor long-duration insurance contracts, reserves for individual and group annuities are generally equal to the present value of expected future policy benefit payments, while the reserves for non-participating term life insurance and individual disability income contracts is generally equal to the present value of expected future policy benefits less the present value of expected net premiums. Issue-year cohorts are used for the reserve calculation and assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated. Separate cohorts are used for the calculation of ceded reserves. An interest accretion rate is determined for an identified cohort and remains unchanged after the issue year. Reserves are remeasured as of each reporting date to reflect the current upper-medium grade fixed income instruments yields, with the impact reported in OCI. If the current upper-medium grade yields decrease 100 basis points, the reduction in OCI would be approximately $2.2 billion, net of income taxes, based on December 31, 2024, reported amounts.\nReserves for participating life insurance contracts are based on the net level premium reserve for death and endowment policy benefits. This net level premium reserve is calculated based on dividend fund interest rates and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in the contract.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor short-duration contracts, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. Our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis including, among other things, experience studies, claim development analysis and annual loss recognition analysis. To the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition, we recognize losses on certain lines of business. The ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of business on which the assumptions were made is extinguished. Short-term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current period net income and can impact quarter-to-quarter net income.\nFuture policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported disability claims. We recognize claims costs in the period the service was provided to our policyholders. However, claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. We determine the amount of this liability using actuarial methods based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging cost trends, where applicable, to determine our estimate of claim liabilities. We also look back to assess how our prior periods’ estimates developed. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense. Historically, the amount of the claim reserve adjustment made in subsequent reporting periods for prior period estimates have been within a reasonable range given our normal claim fluctuations.\nFuture policy benefits and claims also include benefit reserves that are established for universal life-type contracts that provide benefit features that are expected to produce gains in early years followed by losses in later years. The liabilities are accrued in relation to estimated contract assessments.\nSee Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims” for further discussion.\nWe periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are used to project cash flows that are used to compute reserves. For more information see ‘‘Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations — Actuarial Assumption Updates.”\nBenefit Plans\nThe reported expense and liability associated with pension plans requires the use of assumptions. Numerous assumptions are made regarding the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, turnover, expected compensation increases, retirement rates and mortality. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets have the most significant impact on the level of expense.\nThe assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the Projected Benefit Obligation and discounting those cash flows using a spot yield curve for high quality corporate bonds. Our assumed discount rate was 5.50% for our pension plans as of December 31, 2024. Typically, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension benefits Projected Benefit Obligation by approximately $84.8 million and increase the Net Periodic Pension Cost (“NPPC”) by approximately $6.1 million. Typically, a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in the benefit obligation and expense at a level generally commensurate with those noted above.\nThe assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is set at the long-term rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans and the various classes of the invested funds. Historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. The overall long-term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the real risk-free rate of return and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on long-term returns for each asset class, the plan’s target asset allocation policy and the tax structure of the trusts. For the 2024 NPPC, a 6.10% weighted average long-term rate of return was used. For the 2025 NPPC, a 6.40% weighted average long-term rate of return assumption will be used. Typically, a 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return would increase the NPPC by approximately $6.7 million. Typically, a 0.25% increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same levels. The assumed return on plan assets is based on the fair market value of plan assets as of December 31, 2024.\nThe compensation increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. \nFor pension costs, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of plan participants, which is approximately 10 years. The qualified pension plan does not utilize the allowable corridor, while the nonqualified pension plans utilize the 10% corridor. Prior service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately 4 years for pension costs. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Employee and Agent Benefits” for further discussion.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes based on our estimate of the liability for taxes due. Our tax accounting represents management’s best estimate of various events and transactions, such as completion of tax audits or establishment of, or changes to, a valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets, which could affect our estimates and effective income tax rate in a particular quarter or annual period. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realizable. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies management would employ to realize the tax benefit.\nDeferred income taxes (including federal, state and foreign withholding) have not been provided on approximately $1,276.3 million of accumulated but undistributed earnings from operations of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024. We do not record deferred income taxes on foreign earnings not expected to be distributed to the U.S. We apply an exception to the general rule, which under U.S. GAAP otherwise requires the recording of deferred income taxes on the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings as recognized for financial reporting purposes. The exception permits us to not record a deferred income tax liability on foreign earnings we expect to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. The related deferred income taxes will be recorded in the period it becomes apparent we can no longer positively assert some or all the undistributed earnings will remain invested into the foreseeable future.\nThe amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits in the U.S. as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized for book purposes when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met with regard to the validity of an uncertain tax position. Once this threshold is met, for each uncertain tax position we recognize in earnings the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the Internal Revenue Service or other income taxing authorities for audits ongoing or not yet commenced. We do not anticipate the ultimate resolution of audits ongoing or not yet commenced to have a material impact on our net income.\nSee Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Income Taxes” for further discussion.\nRecent Event\nPrincipal Mandatory Provident Funds\nOn January 16, 2025, we announced the signing of an agreement with BCT to expand our investment management capabilities and exit our sponsor and trustee (pension) roles in Hong Kong for MPF Schemes. BCT will be assuming the role as sponsor and trustee for the Principal MPF Schemes. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approval, and will be reported within the Principal Asset Management segment. We expect to record a one-time charge of approximately $140.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 primarily attributable to the write-down of certain intangible assets and deferred contract cost assets, which will reduce pre-tax net income. For segment reporting purposes, the charge will be reported as exited business and net realized capital loss from exiting our roles as MPF Scheme sponsor and trustee. As such, it will have no impact on segment pre-tax operating earnings.\nTransactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations\nYearly Renewable Term Reinsurance Transactions\nDuring 2024, we terminated, executed and amended certain YRT reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies for insurance risks associated with universal life insurance in the Benefits and Protection segment, primarily related to ULSG (“YRT Reinsurance Transactions”).\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther\nActuarial Assumption Updates.\n We periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for the liability for future policy benefits for traditional limited-payment long-duration contracts and other actuarial balances. Assumption updates, model refinements and other updates made resulted in a change in cash flow assumptions that decreased consolidated net income attributable to Principal Financial Group, Inc. by $78.0 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table presents the increase (decrease) to pre-tax operating earnings for each segment.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n \n(in millions)\nRetirement and Income Solutions\n    \n$\n (16.7)\n​\n$\n 53.4\nPrincipal Asset Management\n​\n​\n 21.1\n​\n​\n —\nBenefits and Protection\n​\n​\n (76.7)\n​\n​\n 9.8\n​\nOther Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations\nFluctuations in Foreign Currency to U.S. Dollar Exchange Rates\nFluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for locations in which we have operations can affect reported financial results. In years when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in fewer U.S. dollars to be reported. When foreign currencies strengthen, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in more U.S. dollars to be reported.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items. The most significant impact occurs within our Principal Asset Management segment where pre-tax operating earnings were negatively impacted $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. This impact was calculated by comparing (a) the difference between current year results and prior year results to (b) the difference between current year results and prior year results translated using current year exchange rates for both periods. We use this approach to calculate the impact of exchange rates on all revenue and expense line items. For a discussion of our approaches to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk.”\nEffects of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation has not had a material effect on our annual consolidated results of operations over the past two years. However, we may be materially affected by inflation in the future.\nVariable Investment Income\nVariable investment income includes certain types of investment returns such as prepayment fees and income (loss) from certain elements of our other alternative asset classes, including results of value-add real estate sales activity. Due to its unpredictable nature, variable investment income may or may not be material to our financial results for a given reporting period and may create variances when comparing different reporting periods. For additional information, see “Investment Results.”\nRecent Accounting Changes\nFor recent accounting changes, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies” under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents summary consolidated financial information for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nIncrease \n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n(decrease)\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nRevenues:\n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \nPremiums and other considerations\n​\n$\n 6,850.2\n​\n$\n 6,470.9\n​\n$\n 379.3\nFees and other revenues\n​\n \n 4,320.5\n​\n \n 4,095.9\n​\n \n 224.6\nNet investment income\n​\n \n 4,449.2\n​\n \n 4,091.9\n​\n \n 357.3\nNet realized capital losses\n​\n \n (27.3)\n​\n \n (72.2)\n​\n \n 44.9\nNet realized capital gains on funds withheld assets\n​\n​\n 87.7\n​\n​\n 165.0\n​\n​\n (77.3)\nChange in fair value of funds withheld embedded derivative\n​\n​\n 447.4\n​\n​\n (1,085.7)\n​\n​\n 1,533.1\nTotal revenues\n​\n \n 16,127.7\n​\n \n 13,665.8\n​\n \n 2,461.9\nExpenses:\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\nBenefits, claims and settlement expenses\n​\n \n 8,072.6\n​\n \n 7,788.2\n​\n \n 284.4\nLiability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss\n​\n \n 671.4\n​\n \n (51.6)\n​\n \n 723.0\nMarket risk benefit remeasurement loss\n​\n​\n 30.3\n​\n​\n 29.1\n​\n​\n 1.2\nDividends to policyholders\n​\n​\n 99.9\n​\n​\n 89.2\n​\n​\n 10.7\nOperating expenses\n​\n \n 5,363.9\n​\n \n 5,072.1\n​\n \n 291.8\nTotal expenses\n​\n \n 14,238.1\n​\n \n 12,927.0\n​\n \n 1,311.1\nIncome before income taxes\n​\n \n 1,889.6\n​\n \n 738.8\n​\n \n 1,150.8\nIncome taxes\n​\n \n 291.7\n​\n \n 68.7\n​\n \n 223.0\nNet income\n​\n \n 1,597.9\n​\n \n 670.1\n​\n \n 927.8\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n​\n \n 26.9\n​\n \n 46.9\n​\n \n (20.0)\nNet income attributable to Principal Financial Group, Inc.\n​\n$\n 1,571.0\n​\n$\n 623.2\n​\n$\n 947.8\n​\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nNet Income Attributable to Principal Financial Group, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Principal Financial Group, Inc. increased primarily due to a $1,211.2 million after-tax favorable change in fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivative. This increase was partially offset by a $170.4 million unfavorable one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024.\nTotal Revenues\nPremiums and other considerations increased $201.9 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to higher sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies. The single premium group annuity product, which is typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations, can generate large premiums from very few customers and therefore premiums tend to vary from period to period. Premiums and other considerations increased $168.4 million for the Benefits and Protection segment primarily due to growth in the Specialty Benefits business.\nFees and other revenues increased $109.6 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in fee revenue stemming from an increase in average monthly account values, which largely resulted from more favorable financial markets. Fees and other revenues increased for the Principal Asset Management segment due to $92.7 million higher management fee revenue as a result of increased average AUM managed by our Investment Management operations, which was partially offset by $24.2 million lower performance fee revenue for our Investment Management operations primarily in our real estate business.\nFor net investment income and net realized capital losses variance information, see “Investments — Investment Results” under the captions “Net Investment Income” and “Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses),” respectively.\nNet realized capital gains on funds withheld assets decreased due to lower net gains on sales of funds withheld assets as a result of lower sales in 2024 resulting from less portfolio re-positioning by an external reinsurer.\nThe change in fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivative resulted in a gain in 2024 due primarily to an increase in interest rates as compared to a loss in 2023 due primarily to a tightening of credit spreads.\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTotal Expenses\nBenefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $530.0 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in reserves, stemming from higher sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies. Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $122.0 million for the Benefits and Protection segment due to growth in the Specialty Benefits business. This increase was partially offset by a $345.4 million decrease for the Benefits and Protection segment due to a favorable one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024.\nThe liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss change was primarily due to the unfavorable effect of changes in cash flow assumptions related to a $544.5 million one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024 and a $131.6 million impact driven by actuarial assumption updates and model refinements.\nOperating expenses increased primarily due to a $148.4 million increase in compensation costs, an $85.9 million increase in nondeferrable commission expense and an $81.4 million increase in amounts credited to employee accounts in a nonqualified defined contribution pension plan.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate increased to 15% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 9% for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income with no proportionate change in permanent tax differences. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Income Taxes” under the caption, “Effective Income Tax Rate” for further discussion.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nFor results of operations by segment see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20, Segment Information.”\nRetirement and Income Solutions Segment\nRetirement and Income Solutions Trends\nSeveral key factors impact revenue and earnings growth in the Retirement and Income Solutions segment. These factors include: the ability of our distribution channels to generate new sales and retain existing business; pricing decisions that take account of competitive conditions, persistency, investment returns, mortality trends, and operating expense levels; investment management performance; equity market returns and interest rate changes. Profitability ultimately depends on our ability to price products and invest assets at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products.\nNet revenue and average monthly account values are key metrics used to understand Retirement and Income Solutions earnings growth. Net revenue, which is used only at the segment level, is defined as operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses; liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss; market risk benefit remeasurement (gain) loss and dividends to policyholders. Net revenue is impacted by: (1) changes in the equity markets and interest rates and (2) the difference between investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to the contracts. Average monthly account values include the net balances that customers have accumulated within their account, along with future policy benefits for retirement payout products. Average monthly account values are primarily impacted by net customer cash flows and credit market performance.\nThe following table presents the Retirement and Income Solutions segment net revenue for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\nNet revenue (in millions)\n​\n$\n 2,800.9\n​\n$\n 2,690.3\n​\n$\n 110.6\nAverage monthly account values (in billions)\n​\n$\n 547.3\n​\n$\n 476.5\n​\n$\n 70.8\n​\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRetirement and Income Solutions Segment Summary Financial Data\nThe following table presents certain summary financial data relating to the Retirement and Income Solutions segment for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nOperating revenues:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPremiums and other considerations\n​\n$\n 3,136.9\n​\n$\n 2,935.0\n​\n$\n 201.9\nFees and other revenues\n​\n \n 1,790.4\n​\n \n 1,675.0\n​\n \n 115.4\nNet investment income\n​\n \n 3,048.8\n​\n \n 2,640.2\n​\n \n 408.6\nTotal operating revenues\n​\n \n 7,976.1\n​\n \n 7,250.2\n​\n \n 725.9\nExpenses:\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\nBenefits, claims and settlement expenses, including dividends to policyholders\n​\n \n 5,147.9\n​\n \n 4,624.2\n​\n \n 523.7\nLiability for future policy benefits remeasurement gain\n​\n​\n (4.9)\n​\n​\n (68.0)\n​\n​\n 63.1\nMarket risk benefit remeasurement loss\n​\n​\n 32.2\n​\n​\n 3.7\n​\n​\n 28.5\nOperating expenses\n​\n \n 1,745.2\n​\n \n 1,638.9\n​\n \n 106.3\nTotal expenses\n​\n \n 6,920.4\n​\n \n 6,198.8\n​\n \n 721.6\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPre-tax operating losses attributable to noncontrolling interest\n​\n​\n (0.5)\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n (0.5)\nPre-tax operating earnings\n​\n$\n 1,056.2\n​\n$\n 1,051.4\n​\n$\n 4.8\n​\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nPre-Tax Operating Earnings\nPre-tax operating earnings slightly increased due to an increase in net revenue, which was offset by an increase in operating expenses as described below.\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased primarily due to a $115.4 million increase in fee revenue stemming from an increase in average monthly account values, which largely resulted from more favorable financial markets, and a $62.1 million increase in variable investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $70.1 million impact associated with actuarial assumption updates and model refinements, which was unfavorable in 2024 compared to favorable in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $91.6 million primarily resulting from growth and investments in the business.\nPrincipal Asset Management Segment\nAUM\nAUM forms the basis for generating our management fee revenues. However, in Chile, the Cuprum business operates differently, as most fees are collected with each deposit made by mandatory retirement customers, based on a capped salary level rather than asset levels. AUM growth is primarily driven by two factors: market performance and net cash flow. Market performance encompasses the returns from equity, fixed income, real estate and other alternative investments, while net cash flow reflects client deposits and withdrawals. Revenue growth increasingly depends on the fee levels associated with these deposits and withdrawals, which can vary significantly depending on the business or product mix. Additionally, our non-U.S. results are influenced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. The AUM of our foreign subsidiaries is converted to U.S. dollars at the end of the reporting period using spot exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the reporting period.\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the AUM rollforward for assets managed by Principal Asset Management for the periods indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n​\n​\n(in billions)\nAUM, beginning of period\n​\n$\n 668.3\n​\n$\n 610.5\nNet cash flow\n​\n \n (5.9)\n​\n​\n (8.8)\nMarket performance\n​\n​\n 53.4\n​\n​\n 60.1\nOther (1)\n​\n \n (3.5)\n​\n​\n (0.7)\nOperations disposed (2)\n​\n \n (1.0)\n​\n​\n (0.2)\nEffect of exchange rates\n​\n \n (27.9)\n​\n​\n 7.4\nAUM, end of period\n​\n$\n 683.4\n​\n$\n 668.3\n(1)\nIncludes a $(1.3) billion from a capped-fee arrangement in 2024.

This was partially offset by $24.2 million lower performance fee revenue primarily in our real estate business, a $17.0 million increase in variable compensation expense, a $10.9 million increase in variable AUM expenses and a $5.8 million increase in non-variable staff costs. Pre-tax operating earnings increased in our International Pension operations primarily due to $33.2 million of increased earnings from our equity method investments in Brazil primarily as a result of our actuarial assumption review and other updates and $7.4 million of favorable relative market performance on our required regulatory investments. These improvements were partially offset by $25.7 million of foreign currency headwinds.\nBenefits and Protection Segment\nBenefits and Protection Segment Summary Financial Data\nPremium and fees are a key metric for growth in the Benefits and Protection segment. We receive premiums on our specialty benefits insurance products as well as our traditional life insurance products. Fees are generated from our universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance products. We use several reinsurance programs to help manage the mortality and morbidity risk. Premium and fees are reported net of reinsurance premiums.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the Benefits and Protection segment premium and fees for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease \n​\n​\n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nPremium and fees:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSpecialty Benefits\n    \n$\n 3,257.2\n​\n$\n 3,055.0\n​\n$\n 202.2\nLife Insurance\n​\n \n 927.5\n​\n​\n 922.2\n​\n​\n 5.3\n​\nThe following table presents certain summary financial data relating to the Benefits and Protection segment for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease \n​\n​\n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nOperating revenues:\n    \n​\n  \n    \n​\n  \n    \n​\n  \nPremiums and other considerations\n​\n$\n 3,714.9\n​\n$\n 3,534.1\n​\n$\n 180.8\nFees and other revenues\n​\n \n 469.0\n​\n​\n 441.3\n​\n​\n 27.7\nNet investment income\n​\n \n 605.1\n​\n​\n 575.9\n​\n​\n 29.2\nTotal operating revenues\n​\n \n 4,789.0\n​\n​\n 4,551.3\n​\n​\n 237.7\nExpenses:\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nBenefits, claims and settlement expenses \n​\n \n 2,638.4\n​\n​\n 2,576.3\n​\n​\n 62.1\nDividends to policyholders\n​\n​\n 99.7\n​\n​\n 89.0\n​\n​\n 10.7\nLiability for future policy benefits remeasurement loss\n​\n \n 154.5\n​\n​\n 16.0\n​\n​\n 138.5\nOperating expenses\n​\n \n 1,433.2\n​\n​\n 1,332.4\n​\n​\n 100.8\nTotal expenses\n​\n \n 4,325.8\n​\n​\n 4,013.7\n​\n​\n 312.1\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPre‑tax operating earnings\n​\n$\n 463.2\n​\n$\n 537.6\n​\n$\n (74.4)\n​\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nPre-Tax Operating Earnings\nPre-tax operating earnings in our Specialty Benefits business increased $28.2 million due to growth in the business, partially offset by $10.9 million due to unfavorable actuarial assumptions and model refinements in 2024 compared to favorable in 2023.

We are monitoring our liquidity closely and feel confident in our ability to meet all long-term obligations to customers, policyholders and debt holders. Our sources of strength include our laddered long-term debt maturities with the next maturity occurring in May 2025, access to revolving credit facility and contingent funding arrangements, a strong risk-based capital position and our available cash and liquid assets. Our legal entity structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. Following is a simplified organizational structure.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities. We believe the cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of our operations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies.\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, we believe to be adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. We will continue our prudent capital management practice of regularly exploring options available to us to maximize capital flexibility, including accessing the capital markets and careful attention to and management of expenses.\nWe perform rigorous liquidity stress testing to ensure our asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster our liquidity position under increasingly stressed market conditions. These assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if needed.\nWe also manage liquidity risk by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised at inopportune times. For example, as of December 31, 2024, approximately $14.9 billion, or 99%, of our institutional guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements cannot be redeemed by contractholders prior to maturity. Our individual annuity liabilities also contain surrender charges and other provisions limiting early surrenders.\nThe following table summarizes the withdrawal characteristics of our domestic general account investment contracts as of December 31, 2024.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nContractholder funds,\n    \n​\n \n​\n​\nnet of reinsurance\n​\nPercentage\n​\n​\n​\n(in millions)\n​\n​\n \nNot subject to discretionary withdrawal\n​\n$\n 15,852.4\n​\n 54.9\n%\nSubject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments:\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\nSpecified surrender charges\n​\n \n 6,742.0\n​\n 23.3\n​\nMarket value adjustments\n​\n \n 6,314.9\n​\n 21.8\n​\nSubject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments\n​\n \n 0.8\n​\n —\n​\nTotal domestic investment contracts\n​\n$\n 28,910.1\n​\n 100.0\n%\n​\nUniversal life insurance and certain traditional life insurance policies are also subject to discretionary withdrawals by policyholders.

In addition, our life insurance liabilities include surrender charges to discourage early surrenders.\nWe had the following short-term credit financing structures available with various financial institutions as of December 31, 2024:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nFinancing\n    \n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nAmount\n \nObligor/Applicant\n​\nstructure\n​\nMaturity\n​\nCapacity\n​\noutstanding (4)\n  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n(in millions)\n​\nPrincipal Life (1)\n \nCredit facility\n \nOctober 2027\n​\n$\n 800.0\n​\n$\n —\n​\nPrincipal Compañía de Seguros de Vida Chile S.A.

The credit facility also provides 100% back-stop support for our commercial paper program, of which we had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Most of the banks supporting the credit facility have other relationships with us. Due to the financial strength and the strong relationships we have with these providers, we are comfortable we have very low risk the financial institutions would be unable or unwilling to fund this facility.\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Holding Companies: PFG and PFS.\n The principal sources of funds available to our parent holding company, PFG, are dividends from subsidiaries as well as its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise capital to meet operating and growth needs. These funds are used by PFG to meet its obligations, which include the payment of dividends on common stock, debt service and the repurchase of stock. The declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and will depend on our overall financial condition, results of operations, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, receipt of dividends or other distributions from Principal Life (as described below), risk management considerations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. No significant restrictions limit the payment of dividends by PFG, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in Delaware.\nDividends or other distributions from Principal Life, our primary subsidiary, are limited by Iowa law. Under Iowa law, Principal Life may pay dividends or make other distributions only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa (the “Commissioner”) to pay stockholder dividends or make any other distribution if such distribution would exceed certain statutory limitations. Iowa law gives the Commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for distributions in excess of these limitations. Extraordinary dividends include those made, together with dividends and other distributions, within the preceding twelve months that exceed the greater of (i) 10% of statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year-end excluding admitted disallowed interest maintenance reserve or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year, not to exceed earned surplus. Based on statutory results for the year ended December 31, 2024, the ordinary stockholder dividend limitation for Principal Life is approximately $1,313.1 million in 2025. However, because the dividend test is based on dividends previously paid over rolling twelve month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2025, some or all of such dividends may be extraordinary and require regulatory approval.\nTotal stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent in 2024 were $1,010.0 million, all of which was extraordinary and approved by the Commissioner. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1,941.5 million of cash and liquid assets held in our holding companies and other subsidiaries, which is available for corporate purposes. Corporate balances held in foreign holding companies meet the indefinite reinvestment exception.\nIn 2023, total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent were $1,200.0 million, all of which was extraordinary and approved by the Commissioner.\nOperations.\n Our primary consolidated cash flow sources are premiums from insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset management fee revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments and proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments. Cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders, payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries, payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy loans, interest payments and repayment of short-term debt and long-term debt. Our investment strategies are generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. For a discussion of our investment objectives and strategies, see “Investments.”\nCash Flows.\n Cash flow activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant information regarding our sources and uses of cash. The following discussion of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to the separate accounts.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4,602.9 million and $3,792.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our insurance business typically generates positive cash flows from operating activities, as premiums collected from our insurance products and investment income received exceed acquisition costs, benefits paid, redemptions and operating expenses. These positive cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance and investment products and required capital supporting these products. Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees and investment income received and benefits and expenses paid. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to fluctuations in receivables and payables associated with the timing of settlements, and due to a one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $5,399.0 million and $1,346.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to higher net purchases of available-for-sale securities in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $300.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2,585.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to net investment contract deposits in 2024 as compared to net investment contract withdrawals in 2023 and an increase in banking operation deposits in 2024 as compared to a decrease in 2023. These were partially offset by higher acquisitions of treasury stock in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGuarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities.\n PFG has issued certain notes pursuant to transactions registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Such notes include all currently outstanding senior notes (the “registered notes”). For additional information on the senior notes, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13, Debt.”\nPFS, a wholly owned subsidiary of PFG, has guaranteed each of the registered notes on a full and unconditional basis. The full and unconditional guarantees require PFS to satisfy the obligations of the guaranteed security immediately, if and when PFG has failed to make a scheduled payment thereunder. If PFS does not make such payment, any holder of the guaranteed security may immediately bring suit directly against PFS for payment of amounts due and payable.

See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Employee and Agent Benefits” for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nWe report the net funded status of our pension and OPEB plans in the consolidated statements of financial position. The net funded status represents the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension and OPEB plans. The measurement of the net funded status can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. The net underfunded status of the pension and OPEB obligation was $391.8 million pre-tax and $449.9 million pre-tax as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the funding status mentioned above. The nonqualified pension plan assets are held in Rabbi trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. The assets held in a Rabbi trust are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. Therefore, these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in our funded status as they do not qualify as plan assets under U.S. GAAP. The market value of assets held in these trusts was $348.8 million and $342.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to fund the plan annually in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contributions required under ERISA and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We do not anticipate contributions will be needed in 2025 to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA for our qualified pension plan. We are unable to estimate the amount that may be contributed, but it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2025 up to $70.0 million. This includes funding for both our qualified and nonqualified pension plans. We may contribute to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2025 pending future analysis.\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations and Contractual Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations identified within Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 9, Contractholder Funds, Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims, Note 12, Reinsurance, Note 13, Debt and Note 16, Contingencies, Guarantees, Indemnifications and Leases.” As of December 31, 2024, we had no unique material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations.\nWe have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships and other funds. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of unfunded commitments was $1,882.1 million. We are only required to fund additional equity under these commitments when called upon to do so by the partnership or fund; therefore, these commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nVariable Interest Entities.\n We have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and other entities where we have a variable interest as described in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Variable Interest Entities.” We have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships, as previously discussed in “Contractual Obligations and Contractual Commitments”, some of which are classified as unconsolidated variable interest entities.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications.\n As of December 31, 2024, no significant changes to guarantees and indemnifications have occurred since December 31, 2023. For guarantee and indemnification information, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16, Contingencies, Guarantees, Indemnifications and Leases” under the caption, “Guarantees and Indemnifications.”\nFinancial Strength and Credit Ratings\nOur ratings are influenced by the relative ratings of our peers/competitors as well as many other factors including our operating and financial performance, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), risk exposures, operating leverage and other factors.\nWe have had no significant changes or actions in ratings and rating outlooks that have occurred from January 1, 2024, through the date of this filing.\nThe following table summarizes our significant financial strength and debt ratings from the major independent rating organizations. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such a rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nA.M. Best\n    \nFitch\n    \nMoody’s\n    \nS&P\nLast review date\n​\nMarch 2024\n​\nJune 2024\n​\nJuly 2024\n​\nApril 2024\nCurrent outlook\n​\nStable\n​\nStable\n​\nStable\n​\nStable\nPrincipal Financial Group\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nSenior Unsecured Debt\n \na\n \nA-\n \nBaa1\n \nA-\nLong-Term Issuer Default Rating\n \n  \n \nA\n \n  \n \n  \nPrincipal Life Insurance Company\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nInsurer Financial Strength\n \nA+\n \nAA-\n \nA1\n \nA+\nIssuer Credit Rating\n \naa\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nCommercial Paper\n \nAMB-1+\n \n  \n \nP-1\n \nA-1+\nPrincipal National Life Insurance Company\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nInsurer Financial Strength\n \nA+\n \nAA-\n \nA1\n \nA+\n​\nImpacts of Income Taxes\nFor income tax information, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Income Taxes.”\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety considering factors specific to the asset or liability. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further details, including a reconciliation of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 47% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 50% were Level 2 and 3% were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of December 31, 2024, 4% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 87% were Level 2 and 9% were Level 3.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 46% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 51% were Level 2 and 3% were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of December 31, 2023, 3% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 88% were Level 2 and 9% were Level 3.\nChanges in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\nNet assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of December 31, 2024, were $8,046.3 million as compared to $7,447.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in the funds withheld payable embedded derivative net asset.\nInvestments\nWe had total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2024, of $313,663.6 million, of which $103,375.8 million were invested assets. A portion of our invested assets represent funds withheld backing reserves as part of coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements. The funds withheld assets and associated net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses) are not included in the discussions below as the investment risk is passed to the reinsurer. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Reinsurance” for more information on the funds withheld assets. The rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk; therefore, the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets.\nOverall Composition of Invested Assets\nInvested assets as of December 31, 2024, were predominantly high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry and geographic location. Asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. As shown in the following table, the major categories of invested assets are fixed maturities and mortgage loans.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n​\nInvestments\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nexcluding\n​\nFunds\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nfunds withheld\n    \nwithheld\n    \nTotal\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nFixed maturities\n    \n$\n 55,455.3\n​\n$\n 13,819.0\n​\n$\n 69,274.3\nEquity securities\n​\n \n 2,294.7\n​\n \n 0.3\n​\n \n 2,295.0\nMortgage loans\n​\n \n 18,271.8\n​\n \n 2,212.4\n​\n \n 20,484.2\nReal estate\n​\n \n 2,464.5\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 2,464.5\nPolicy loans\n​\n \n 867.5\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 867.5\nOther investments\n​\n \n 6,847.5\n​\n \n 1,142.8\n​\n \n 7,990.3\nTotal invested assets\n​\n \n 86,201.3\n​\n \n 17,174.5\n​\n \n 103,375.8\nCash and cash equivalents\n​\n \n 3,131.8\n​\n \n 1,080.1\n​\n \n 4,211.9\nTotal invested assets and cash\n​\n$\n 89,333.1\n​\n$\n 18,254.6\n​\n$\n 107,587.7\n​\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n​\nInvestments \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nexcluding \n​\nFunds \n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nfunds withheld\n    \nwithheld\n    \nTotal\n​\n \n(in millions)\nFixed maturities\n​\n$\n 50,605.0\n​\n$\n 15,904.3\n​\n$\n 66,509.3\nEquity securities\n​\n \n 1,477.8\n​\n​\n 0.3\n​\n​\n 1,478.1\nMortgage loans\n​\n \n 17,756.9\n​\n​\n 2,385.9\n​\n​\n 20,142.8\nReal estate\n​\n \n 2,345.3\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n 2,345.3\nPolicy loans\n​\n \n 809.3\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n 809.3\nOther investments\n​\n \n 6,414.2\n​\n​\n 621.4\n​\n​\n 7,035.6\nTotal invested assets\n​\n \n 79,408.5\n​\n​\n 18,911.9\n​\n​\n 98,320.4\nCash and cash equivalents\n​\n \n 3,889.3\n​\n​\n 818.4\n​\n​\n 4,707.7\nTotal invested assets and cash\n​\n$\n 83,297.8\n​\n$\n 19,730.3\n​\n$\n 103,028.1\n​\nInvestment Results\nNet Investment Income\nThe following table presents the yield and investment income, excluding net realized capital gains and losses, for our invested assets for the years indicated.

These decreases were partially offset increased losses on commercial mortgage loans reserve changes, increased losses on GMWB/RILA activities and reduced gains on equity securities and sponsored investment funds due to equity market movement.\nU.S. Investment Operations\nIn the following sections, we provide details about U.S. Investment Operations, excluding investments held as part of coinsurance with funds withheld agreements. We believe the details of the composition of our investment portfolio excluding the funds withheld are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors because all funds withheld assets support obligations and liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements. Guidelines are in place to ensure the investment risk associated with these fund withheld assets are appropriately managed. See Note 12, Reinsurance, for further information on the funds withheld assets.\nOf our invested assets, $80,073.4 million were held by our U.S. operations as of December 31, 2024. Our U.S. invested assets are managed primarily by Principal Asset Management – Investment Management. Our Investment Committee, appointed by our Board, is responsible for establishing investment policies and monitoring risk limits and tolerances. Our primary investment objective is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. We seek to protect customers’ benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through asset/liability matching, reducing credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. We are exposed to two primary sources of investment risk:\n●\ncredit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest and\n●\ninterest rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves.\nOur ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. We devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. We manage credit risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification.\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA dedicated committee, comprised of senior investment professional staff members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturities we purchase. We have teams of security analysts, organized by industry and asset class, that analyze and monitor these investments. Investments held in the portfolio are monitored on a continuous basis with a formal review annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer. The analysis includes both fundamental and technical factors. The fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer. The qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness of the issuer. In addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored. We regularly review our investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria:\n●\nmaterial changes in the issuer’s revenues, margins, capital structure or collateral values;\n●\nsignificant management or organizational changes;\n●\nsignificant changes regarding the issuer’s industry;\n●\ndebt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds;\n●\nviolation of financial covenants and\n●\nother business factors that relate to the issuer.\nWe purchase credit default swaps to hedge certain credit exposures in our investment portfolio. We economically hedged credit exposure in our portfolio by purchasing credit default swaps with a notional amount of $155.0 million and $85.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We sell credit default swaps and total return swaps to offer credit protection to investors when entering into synthetic replicating transactions. When selling credit protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security. When selling total return swaps, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to compensate the protection buyer for any decline in the price of the referenced security. For further information on credit derivatives sold, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments” under the caption, “Credit Derivatives Sold.”\nOur use of derivatives exposes us to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract. We actively manage this risk by:\n●\nobtaining approval of all new counterparties by the Investment Committee;\n●\nestablishing exposure limits that take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure;\n●\nperforming similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis;\n●\ndiversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties;\n●\nimplementing credit support annex (collateral) agreements (“CSAs”) for over-the-counter derivative transactions or similar agreements with a majority of our counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures, which provide for netting of exposures;\n●\nlimiting exposure to A credit or better for over-the-counter derivative counterparties without CSAs;\n●\nconducting stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction;\n●\ndaily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings, exposures and associated collateral levels and\n●\ntrading mandatorily cleared contracts through centralized clearinghouses.\nWe manage our exposure on a net basis, whereby we net positive and negative exposures for each counterparty with agreements in place. For further information on derivative exposure, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Balance Sheet Offsetting.”\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. We apply a variety of guidelines to minimize credit risk in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. When considering new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a physical assessment of the underlying commercial real estate, conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. We use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and substantially all existing loans within the portfolio. The proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns. Our lending guidelines are typically 75% or less loan-to-value ratio and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. We analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. The following table presents loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios for our brick and mortar commercial mortgage loans:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nWeighted average loan\n‑\nto\n‑\nvalue ratio\n​\nDebt service coverage ratio\n \n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n  \nNew mortgages\n \n 53\n%  \n 50\n%  \n 1.7\nx\n 1.4\nx\nEntire mortgage portfolio\n \n 50\n%  \n 49\n%  \n 2.3\nx\n 2.5\nx\n​\nWe also seek to manage call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates. We assess and price for call or prepayment risks in all of our investments and monitor these risks in accordance with asset/liability management policies.\nThe amortized cost and weighted average yield, calculated using amortized cost, of non-structured fixed maturity securities that will be callable at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $2,091.5 million and 4.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and $2,159.0 million and 4.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the amortized cost and weighted average yield of residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities (“RMBS”), residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities - home equity with material prepayment risk were $8,401.9 million and 4.1%, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and $6,959.0 million and 3.7%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nOur investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation. In addition, we diversify our product portfolio offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates. Those features include adjustable crediting rates, policy surrender charges and market value adjustments on liquidations. For further information on our management of interest rate risk, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”\nOverall Composition of U.S. Invested Assets\nAs shown in the following table, the major categories of U.S. invested assets are fixed maturities and mortgage loans.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \n% of total\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \n% of total\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nFixed maturities\n​\n$\n 52,960.3\n​\n 66\n%  \n$\n 47,802.3\n​\n 66\n%\nEquity securities\n​\n \n 1,547.6\n \n 2\n​\n \n 667.9\n \n 1\n​\nMortgage loans\n​\n​\n 17,404.6\n​\n 22\n​\n​\n 16,792.1\n​\n 23\n​\nReal estate\n​\n \n 2,463.7\n \n 3\n​\n \n 2,343.4\n \n 3\n​\nPolicy loans\n​\n \n 852.5\n \n 1\n​\n \n 793.2\n \n 1\n​\nOther investments\n​\n \n 4,844.7\n \n 6\n​\n \n 4,121.2\n \n 6\n​\nTotal invested assets\n​\n \n 80,073.4\n \n 100\n%  \n \n 72,520.1\n \n 100\n%\nCash and cash equivalents\n​\n \n 2,882.9\n \n​\n​\n​\n 3,668.8\n \n  \n​\nTotal invested assets and cash\n​\n$\n 82,956.3\n​\n​\n​\n$\n 76,188.9\n \n  \n​\n​\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFixed Maturities\nFixed maturities include bonds, ABS, redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. \nFixed maturities were diversified by category of issuer, as shown in the following table for the years indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \nPercent of total\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \nPercent of total\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nU.S. government and agencies\n​\n$\n 1,102.6\n​\n 2\n%  \n$\n 1,231.9\n​\n 3\n%\nNon-U.S. governments\n​\n \n 393.0\n​\n 1\n​\n \n 378.5\n​\n 1\n​\nStates and political subdivisions\n​\n \n 4,836.3\n​\n 9\n​\n \n 5,143.7\n​\n 11\n​\nCorporate - public\n​\n \n 13,405.7\n​\n 25\n​\n \n 13,690.1\n​\n 29\n​\nCorporate - private\n​\n \n 13,193.4\n​\n 25\n​\n \n 11,258.2\n​\n 24\n​\nResidential mortgage-backed pass-through securities\n​\n \n 3,673.6\n​\n 7\n​\n \n 3,061.8\n​\n 5\n​\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n​\n \n 4,446.8\n​\n 8\n​\n \n 3,854.5\n​\n 8\n​\nResidential collateralized mortgage obligations\n​\n \n 4,043.3\n​\n 8\n​\n \n 3,214.8\n​\n 7\n​\nAsset-backed securities\n​\n \n 7,865.6\n​\n 15\n​\n \n 5,968.8\n​\n 12\n​\nTotal fixed maturities\n​\n$\n 52,960.3\n​\n 100\n%  \n$\n 47,802.3\n​\n 100\n%\n​\nWe believe it is desirable to hold residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification characteristics. Our portfolio is comprised of Government National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation pass-through securities. In addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities.\nWe purchase commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. The primary risks in holding CMBS are structural and credit risks. Structural risks include the security’s priority in the issuer’s capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks involve collateral and issuer/servicer risk where collateral and servicer performance may deteriorate. CMBS are predominantly comprised of large pool securitizations that are diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion. The risks to any CMBS deal are determined by the credit quality of the underlying loans and how those loans perform over time. Another key risk is the vintage of the underlying loans and the state of the markets during a particular vintage.\nSimilar to CMBS, we purchase ABS for diversification and to provide attractive returns. The primary risks in holding ABS are also structural and credit risks, which are similar to those noted above for CMBS. Our ABS portfolio is diversified by type of asset, issuer, and vintage. We actively monitor holdings of ABS to recognize adverse changes in the risk profile of each security. Prepayments in the ABS portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated from such changes by call protection features. In the event we are subject to prepayment risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those ABS. In addition, we hold a diverse class of securities, which limits our exposure to any one security.\nThe international exposure held in our U.S. operation’s fixed maturities portfolio was 14% of total fixed maturities as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. It is comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturities.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n  \n​\n​\n(in millions)\n \nEuropean Union\n    \n$\n 2,227.9\n​\n$\n 1,826.8\n​\nAustralia/New Zealand\n​\n \n 1,508.6\n​\n​\n 1,389.6\n​\nUnited Kingdom\n​\n \n 1,330.5\n​\n​\n 1,147.7\n​\nLatin America\n​\n \n 1,031.4\n​\n​\n 995.6\n​\nAsia-Pacific\n​\n \n 490.7\n​\n​\n 530.2\n​\nMiddle East and Africa\n​\n \n 490.7\n​\n​\n 451.3\n​\nEurope, non-European Union\n​\n \n 320.5\n​\n​\n 258.1\n​\nOther\n​\n \n 205.4\n​\n​\n 115.1\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 7,605.7\n​\n$\n 6,714.4\n​\n​\nInternational fixed maturities exposure is determined by the country of risk of the obligor entity. All international fixed maturities held by our U.S. operations are either denominated in U.S. dollars or have been swapped into U.S. dollar equivalents. Our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals. We control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks, which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country. Our investment policy limits total international fixed maturities investments and we are within those internal limits. Exposure to Canada is not included in our international exposure. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investments in Canada totaled $966.1 million and $958.0 million, respectively.\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFixed Maturities Credit Concentrations.\n One aspect of managing credit risk is through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. Our credit concentrations are managed to established limits. The top 10 exposures comprised 5.4% of single-name credit fixed maturity exposures as of December 31, 2024, and 4.8% as of December 31, 2023.\nFixed Maturities Valuation and Credit Quality.\n Valuation techniques for the fixed maturities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data. The use of different pricing techniques and their assumptions could produce different financial results. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further details regarding our pricing methodology. Once prices are determined, they are reviewed by pricing analysts for reasonableness based on asset class and observable market data. Investment analysts who are familiar with specific securities review prices for reasonableness through direct interaction with external sources, review of recent trade activity or use of internal models. All fixed maturities placed on the “watch list” are periodically analyzed by investment analysts. These analysts periodically meet with the Chief Investment Officer and the Portfolio Managers to determine reasonableness of the analysts’ prices. The valuation of bonds for which a credit loss exists and there is no quoted price is typically based on relative value analysis and the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. Although we believe these values reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other market factors involve qualitative and unobservable inputs. \nThe Securities Valuation Office (“SVO”) of the NAIC monitors the bond investments of insurers for regulatory capital and reporting purposes and, when required, assigns securities to one of six categories referred to as NAIC designations. Although NAIC designations are not produced to aid the investment decision making process, NAIC designations may serve as a reasonable proxy for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations’ (“NRSRO”) credit ratings for certain bonds. For most corporate bonds, NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade by such rating organizations. Bonds are considered investment grade when rated ‘‘Baa3’’ or higher by Moody’s, or ‘‘BBB-’’ or higher by S&P. NAIC designations 3 through 6 include bonds generally referred to as below investment grade. Bonds are considered below investment grade when rated ‘‘Ba1’’ or lower by Moody’s, or ‘‘BB+’’ or lower by S&P. \nFor loan-backed and structured securities, as defined by the NAIC, the NAIC designation is not always a reasonable indication of an NRSRO rating as described below. For CMBS and non-agency RMBS, Blackrock Solutions undertakes the modeling of those NAIC designations. This may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the NRSRO credit rating. \nThe following table presents our total fixed maturities by NAIC designation as of the years indicated as well as the percentage, based on fair value, that each designation comprises.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercent of\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercent of\n \n​\n​\nAmortized\n​\nCarrying\n​\ncarrying\n​\nAmortized\n​\nCarrying\n​\ncarrying\n \nNAIC designation\n​\ncost\n​\n amount\n​\namount\n​\n \ncost\n​\namount\n​\namount\n \n​\n \n($ in millions)\n​\n1\n    \n$\n 38,458.6\n    \n$\n 35,638.3\n    \n 67\n%  \n$\n 34,601.1\n    \n$\n 32,078.6\n    \n 67\n%\n2\n​\n \n 15,418.8\n​\n \n 14,515.9\n \n 27\n​\n \n 13,624.2\n​\n \n 12,749.5\n \n 27\n​\n3\n​\n \n 2,459.0\n​\n \n 2,389.5\n \n 5\n​\n \n 2,727.3\n​\n \n 2,615.1\n \n 5\n​\n4\n​\n \n 369.1\n​\n \n 338.5\n \n 1\n​\n \n 354.1\n​\n \n 327.4\n \n 1\n​\n5\n​\n \n 84.1\n​\n \n 68.5\n \n —\n​\n \n 9.1\n​\n \n 7.5\n \n —\n​\n6\n​\n \n 12.6\n​\n \n 9.6\n \n —\n​\n \n 31.1\n​\n \n 24.2\n \n —\n​\nUnallocated portfolio layer method basis adjustment (1)\n​\n​\n (55.7)\n​\n​\n —\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n —\n​\nTotal fixed maturities\n​\n$\n 56,746.5\n​\n$\n 52,960.3\n \n 100\n%  \n$\n 51,346.9\n​\n$\n 47,802.3\n \n 100\n%\n(1)\nAmounts represent unallocated basis adjustments related to fair value hedges utilizing the portfolio layer method.\nFixed maturities included 43 securities with an amortized cost of $622.7 million, gross gains of $3.7 million, gross losses of $6.3 million, valuation allowance of $0.0 million and a carrying amount of $620.1 million as of December 31, 2024, that were still pending a review and assignment of a designation by the SVO or NRSRO ratings to be assigned. Due to the timing of when fixed maturities are purchased, legal documents are filed and the review by the SVO is completed, or NRSRO ratings that have expired or been withdrawn, we will always have securities in our portfolio that are unrated over a reporting period.

We define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) with principal and/or interest payments in default or where default is perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. We define potential problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal “watch list” for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. We define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower’s financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. We determine that restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows. If the present value of the restructured cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is established.\nThe following table presents the total carrying amount of our fixed maturities portfolio, as well as its problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities for the years indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nTotal fixed maturities\n    \n$\n 52,960.3\n    \n$\n 47,802.3\n​\nProblem fixed maturities (1)\n​\n$\n 76.5\n​\n$\n 42.6\n​\nPotential problem fixed maturities\n​\n \n 88.3\n​\n \n 66.7\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities\n​\n$\n 164.8\n​\n$\n 109.3\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities as a percent of total fixed maturities\n​\n \n 0.31\n%  \n \n 0.23\n%\n(1)\nThe problem fixed maturities carrying amount is net of the credit loss valuation allowance.\nFixed Maturities Credit Losses.\n Each reporting period, a group of individuals including the Chief Investment Officer, our Portfolio Managers, the assigned analysts and representatives from Investment Accounting review all securities to determine whether a credit loss exists. The analysis focuses on each issuer’s ability to service its debts in a timely fashion. Formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management. For additional details regarding our process to identify and evaluate securities with credit losses, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Allowance for Credit Loss.”\nWe would not consider a security with unrealized losses to have a decline in value due to credit when it is not our intent to sell the security, it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be maturity, and we expect to recover the amortized cost basis. However, we do sell securities under certain circumstances, such as when we have evidence of a change in the issuer’s creditworthiness, when we anticipate poor relative future performance of securities, when a change in regulatory requirements modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. Sales generate both gains and losses.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit losses and determining the allowance for credit loss. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer’s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period.\nThe net realized loss relating to the change in the allowance for credit loss and credit related sales of fixed maturities was $28.3 million and $48.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFixed Maturities Available-For-Sale\nThe following tables present our fixed maturities

31, 2024, $5.3 million in losses were attributed to securities scheduled to mature in one year or less, $222.4 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between one to five years, $572.5 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between five to ten years, $2,384.7 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature after ten years and $1,061.3 million related to mortgage-backed and other ABS that are not classified by maturity year. As of December 31, 2024, we were in a $3,769.9 million net unrealized loss position as compared to a $3,542.9 million net unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023. The $227.0 million increase in net unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2024, can be attributed to an increase in interest rates partially offset by tightening of credit spreads.\nFixed Maturities Available-For-Sale Unrealized Losses.\n We believe our long-term fixed maturities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities. Each year, we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturities. Our current policy is to limit the percentage of fixed maturities invested in below investment grade assets to 15%.\nWe invest in privately placed fixed maturities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality public market securities. Generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral. They are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by U.S. federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our fixed maturities available-for-sale by investment grade and below investment grade as of the years indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nGross\n    \nGross\n    \nAllowance\n    \n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nGross\n    \nGross\n    \nAllowance\n    \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nAmortized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nfor credit\n​\nCarrying\n​\nAmortized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nfor credit\n​\nCarrying\n \n​\n​\ncost\n​\ngains\n​\nlosses\n​\nloss\n​\namount\n​\ncost\n​\ngains\n​\nlosses\n​\nloss\n​\namount\n  \n​\n​\n(in millions)\n \nInvestment grade:\n \n​\n  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPublic\n​\n$\n 40,829.3\n​\n$\n 223.4\n​\n$\n 3,319.7\n​\n$\n 0.1\n​\n$\n 37,732.9\n​\n$\n 37,197.9\n​\n$\n 324.9\n​\n$\n 3,077.1\n​\n$\n —\n​\n$\n 34,445.7\n​\nPrivate\n​\n \n 12,665.7\n​\n \n 177.5\n​\n \n 804.3\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 12,038.9\n​\n \n 10,738.5\n​\n \n 137.7\n​\n \n 782.7\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 10,093.5\n​\nBelow investment grade:\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nPublic\n​\n \n 1,047.1\n​\n \n 6.5\n​\n \n 102.4\n​\n \n 0.1\n​\n \n 951.1\n​\n \n 1,352.1\n​\n \n 6.2\n​\n \n 139.1\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 1,219.2\n​\nPrivate\n​\n \n 1,612.3\n​\n \n 13.2\n​\n \n 19.8\n​\n \n 16.1\n​\n \n 1,589.6\n​\n \n 1,623.0\n​\n \n 10.3\n​\n \n 23.1\n​\n \n 1.7\n​\n \n 1,608.5\n​\nTotal fixed maturities, available-for-sale (1)\n​\n$\n 56,154.4\n​\n$\n 420.6\n​\n$\n 4,246.2\n​\n$\n 16.3\n​\n$\n 52,312.5\n​\n$\n 50,911.5\n​\n$\n 479.1\n​\n$\n 4,022.0\n​\n$\n 1.7\n​\n$\n 47,366.9\n​\n(1)\nExcludes unallocated basis adjustments related to fair value hedges utilizing the portfolio layer method.\nIncluded in the public category carrying amount as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were $15,165.7 million and $12,017.4 million, respectively, of securities subject to certain holding periods and resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933.\nThe following tables present the fair value and the gross unrealized losses on our fixed maturities available-for-sale for which an allowance for credit loss has not been recorded by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n​\nLess than\n​\nGreater than or\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\ntwelve months\n​\nequal to twelve months\n​\nTotal\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross\n​\n​\nFair\n​\nunrealized\n​\nFair\n​\nunrealized\n​\nFair\n​\nunrealized\n​\n    \nvalue\n    \nlosses\n    \nvalue\n    \nlosses\n    \nvalue\n    \nlosses\n​\n \n(in millions)\nFixed maturities, available-for-sale (1):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nU.S. government and agencies\n​\n$\n 641.2\n​\n$\n 13.7\n​\n$\n 543.2\n​\n$\n 82.2\n​\n$\n 1,184.4\n​\n$\n 95.9\nNon-U.S. governments\n​\n \n 32.9\n​\n \n 1.3\n​\n \n 207.0\n​\n \n 54.5\n​\n \n 239.9\n​\n \n 55.8\nStates and political subdivisions\n​\n \n 704.7\n​\n \n 23.8\n​\n \n 3,552.3\n​\n \n 785.6\n​\n \n 4,257.0\n​\n \n 809.4\nCorporate\n​\n \n 3,289.0\n​\n \n 65.7\n​\n \n 14,243.8\n​\n \n 2,157.9\n​\n \n 17,532.8\n​\n \n 2,223.6\nResidential mortgage-backed pass-through securities\n​\n \n 1,938.4\n​\n \n 33.1\n​\n \n 1,211.6\n​\n \n 181.1\n​\n \n 3,150.0\n​\n \n 214.2\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n​\n \n676.9\n​\n \n 8.1\n​\n \n 3,157.3\n​\n \n 362.4\n​\n \n 3,834.2\n​\n \n 370.5\nCollateralized debt obligations (2)\n​\n \n 259.5\n​\n \n 0.3\n​\n \n 29.8\n​\n \n 5.0\n​\n \n 289.3\n​\n \n 5.3\nOther debt obligations\n​\n \n 1,363.1\n​\n \n 17.1\n​\n \n 2,799.2\n​\n \n 453.0\n​\n \n 4,162.3\n​\n \n 470.1\nTotal fixed maturities, available-for-sale\n​\n$\n 8,905.7\n​\n$\n 163.1\n​\n$\n 25,744.2\n​\n$\n 4,081.7\n​\n$\n 34,649.9\n​\n$\n 4,244.8\n(1)\nFair value and gross unrealized losses are excluded for available-for-sale securities for which an allowance for credit loss has been recorded.

For further details about residential mortgage loans, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables.”\nCommercial Mortgage Loans.\n We generally report commercial mortgage loans on real estate at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances.\nCommercial mortgage loans play an important role in our investment strategy by:\n●\nproviding strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives;\n●\nenhancing total returns and\n●\nproviding strategic portfolio diversification.\nAs a result, we have focused on constructing a high quality portfolio of mortgages. Our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages originated with conservative loan-to-value ratios, high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy.\nOur commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. The mortgage portfolio is comprised primarily of office properties, apartments, well-anchored retail properties and general-purpose industrial properties.\nOur commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by geography and specific collateral property type. Commercial mortgage lending in the state of California accounted for 24% and 25% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio before valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We are, therefore, exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of catastrophes, including but not limited to earthquakes, fires, drought, extreme heat, flooding, and tsunamis, that may affect the region. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not experience any material losses due to the aforementioned catastrophe risks.\nThe typical borrower in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is a single purpose entity or single asset entity. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding were 620 and 596, of which 35% and 38% were for loans with principal balances less than $10.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was $23.2 million and $22.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nCommercial Mortgage Loan Credit Monitoring.\n For further details on monitoring and management of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables Credit Monitoring.”\n69\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe categorize loans that are 60 days or more delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are delinquent as “problem” loans. We categorize loans that are delinquent less than 60 days where the default is expected to be cured and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are current as “potential problem” loans. The decision whether to classify a loan delinquent less than 60 days as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. We categorize loans for which the original note rate has been reduced below market and loans for which the principal has been reduced as “restructured” loans. We also consider loans that are refinanced more than one year beyond the original maturity or call date at below market rates as restructured.\nWe had three delinquent problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $20.6 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $18.9 million as of December 31, 2024. We also had two potential problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $140.5 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $33.0 million and one restructured problem commercial mortgage loan with a carrying amount of $34.1 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $34.1 million as of December 31, 2024. We had one delinquent problem commercial mortgage loan with a carrying amount of $7.9 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $7.9 million as of December 31, 2023. We also had two potential problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $95.4 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $11.9 million and two restructured problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $92.7 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $34.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nTotal commercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n 14,196.0\n​\n$\n 13,544.9\n​\nProblem commercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n 1.7\n​\n$\n —\n​\nPotential problem commercial mortgage loans\n​\n​\n 107.5\n​\n​\n 83.5\n​\nRestructured problem commercial mortgage loans\n​\n​\n —\n​\n \n 58.6\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured commercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n 109.2\n​\n$\n 142.1\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured commercial mortgage loans as a percent of total commercial mortgage loans\n​\n \n 0.77\n%  \n \n 1.05\n%\n​\nCommercial Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowance.\n We establish the commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance at levels considered adequate to absorb estimated expected credit losses within the portfolio. For further details on the commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables Valuation Allowance.”  \nReal Estate\nReal estate consists primarily of commercial equity real estate. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of our equity real estate investment was $2,463.7 million and $2,343.4 million, respectively. Our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly owned real estate, real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and majority owned interests in real estate joint ventures.\nEquity real estate is categorized as either “real estate held for investment” or “real estate held for sale.” The carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Such impairment adjustments are recorded as net realized capital losses in our consolidated results of operations. No such impairment adjustments were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 or for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOnce we identify a real estate property to be sold and it is probable that it will be sold, we classify the property as held for sale. We establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if necessary, to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value, less associated selling costs. The valuation allowance did not change for the year ended December 31, 2024 or for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. We monitor product, geographic and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix.\nEquity real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country. As of December 31, 2024, our largest equity real estate portfolio concentration was in the Pacific (47%) region of the United States. By property type, our largest concentrations were in Industrial (33%) and Office (32%) as of December 31, 2024.\n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther Investments\nOur other investments totaled $4,844.7 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $4,121.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Other investments include interests in unconsolidated entities, which include real estate properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners; sponsored investment funds; the cash surrender value of company owned and trust owned life insurance; derivative assets and other investments.\nInternational Investment Operations\nOf our invested assets, $6,127.9 million were held by our international operations as of December 31, 2024. Due to the regulatory constraints in each location, each company maintains its own investment policies.
