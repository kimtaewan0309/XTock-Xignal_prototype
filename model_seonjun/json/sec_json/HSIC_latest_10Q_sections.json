upon as a prediction \nof actual results.\n \nWe undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as \nrequired by law.\nWhere You\n \nCan Find Important Information\nWe may disclose important information through one or more of the following channels: SEC filings, public \nconference calls and webcasts, press releases, the investor relations\n \npage of our website (www.henryschein.com) \nand the social media channels identified on the About Media Center page\n \nof our website.\nRecent Developments \nWhile the U.S. economy has experienced inflationary pressures and fluctuation\n \nof the U.S. dollar, their impacts \nhave not been material to our results of operations.\n \nThough inflation impacts both our revenues and costs, the\n \ndepth \nand breadth of our product portfolio often allows us to offer lower-cost national brand solutions\n \nor corporate brand \nalternatives to our more price-sensitive customers who are unwilling to\n \nabsorb price increases, thus positioning us \nto protect our gross profit. \nSegment Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 28, 2024,\n \nwe revised our reportable segments to align \nwith how the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer manages the business, assesses\n \nperformance and allocates \nresources.\n \nOur revised reportable segments now consist of: (i) Global Distribution\n \nand Value\n \n-Added Services; (ii) \nGlobal Specialty Products; and (iii) Global Technology. \nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services includes distribution to the global dental and medical markets of \nnational brand and corporate brand merchandise, as well as equipment and related\n \ntechnical services.\n \nThis segment \nalso includes value-added services such as financial services, continuing\n \neducation services, consulting and other \nservices.\n \nThis segment also markets and sells under our own corporate brand\n \na portfolio of cost-effective, high-\nquality consumable merchandise.\n \nGlobal Specialty Products includes manufacturing, marketing\n \nand sales of dental \nimplant and biomaterial products; and endodontic, orthodontic and orthopedic\n \nproducts and other health care-\nrelated products and services.\n \nGlobal Technology includes development and distribution of practice management \nsoftware, e-services and other products, which are distributed to health\n \ncare providers. \nCyber Incident \nAs previously reported, in October 2023 Henry Schein experienced\n \na cyber incident that primarily affected the \noperations of our North American and European dental and medical\n \ndistribution businesses.\n \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we had a\n \nsales decrease in our dental and medical \ndistribution businesses, which we believe was primarily a result of lower sales\n \nto episodic customers following the \ncyber incident. \nWith respect to the October 2023 cyber incident, we have a $60 million insurance policy, following a $5 million \nretention.\n \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025,\n \nwe did not incur any expenses directly \nrelated to the cyber incident.\n \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 we\n \nincurred $3 million \nand $8 million, respectively, of expenses related to the cyber incident, mostly consisting of professional\n \nfees.\n \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we received\n \ninsurance proceeds of $10 million and \n$20 million, respectively, representing a partial insurance recovery of losses related to the cyber incident.\n \nDuring \nthe three months ended March 29, 2025 we received insurance proceeds\n \nof $20 million, representing the remaining \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n39 \ninsurance recovery of losses related to the cyber incident.\n \nThe expenses and insurance recoveries related to the \ncyber incident are included in the selling, general and administrative\n \nline in our condensed consolidated statements \nof income. \nTariffs and Related Economic Conditions\n \nThe U.S. has adopted new and increased tariffs on imports from countries, subject\n \nto evolving exemptions, with \nadditional tariff increases proposed but currently on pause.\n \nSome countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs and \nother restrictions on imports from the U.S.\n \nThe U.S. government is reported to be in negotiations with certain\n \nother \ncountries over tariff rates and other trade policies.\n \nThese developments, and anticipated future developments, have \ncreated a volatile environment for global trade, and new trade policies\n \nwith individual countries, if finalized, are \nexpected to be announced incrementally over a period of time.\n \nThe tariffs did not have a material impact on our results of operations in the first,\n \nsecond, or third quarter of this \nfiscal year, although sales of U.S. dental equipment were temporarily impacted by market uncertainty\n \nrelated to \ntariffs in the second half of the quarter ended June 28, 2025.\n \nIt is unclear whether, or the extent to which, the \ncurrent tariffs on trade with numerous countries will remain in place, or change, the\n \nexceptions that may apply, and \ntheir timing.\n \nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act \nIn the United States, the OBBBA, signed into law on July 4, 2025, includes\n \na number of provisions that are \nexpected to result in reductions in the number of Medicaid enrollees, which\n \nwill reduce utilization of services and \ncovered products generally.\n \nThere are also several provisions that will reduce federal funding to state\n \nMedicaid \nprograms.\n \nThe OBBBA, in combination with tariffs, will almost certainly have an\n \nadverse impact on utilization, \nMedicaid payment and cost of production (if foreign components are used).\n \nThe OBBBA also includes changes to corporate tax rates, limitations\n \non certain deductions and modifications to \ninternational tax provisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n40 \nExecutive-Level Overview \nHenry Schein, Inc. is a solutions company for health care professionals powered\n \nby a network of people and \ntechnology.\n \nWe \nbelieve we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-\nbased dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care.\n \nWe \nserve more than one million customers \nworldwide including dental practitioners, laboratories, physician practices and\n \nambulatory surgery centers, as well \nas government, institutional health care clinics, home health providers, and\n \nother alternate care clinics.\n \nWe \nbelieve \nthat we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 93 years of experience\n \ndistributing health care products.\nWe \nare headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 25,000 people (of which approximately 13,000 are \nbased outside of the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 33 countries and\n \nterritories.\n \nOur broad \nglobal footprint has evolved over time through our organic growth as well as through\n \ncontribution from strategic \nacquisitions.\nWe \nhave established strategically located distribution centers around\n \nthe world to enable us to better serve our \ncustomers and increase our operating efficiency.\n \nThis infrastructure, together with broad product and service \nofferings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables\n \nus to be a single source of \nsupply for our customers’ needs.\nAs a distributor, we market and sell branded products as well as our own corporate brand portfolio of\n \ncost-effective, \nhigh-quality consumable merchandise products.\n \nWe \nalso manufacture, source and sell a range of company-owned \nmanufactured products, primarily implants, biomaterial products, endodontics,\n \nhandpiece and small equipment, \nhand instrument and repair, restoratives, orthodontics, wound care, orthopedics and dental lab products.\n \nWe \nhave \nachieved scale in these global businesses primarily through acquisitions, as\n \nmanufacturers of these products \ntypically do not utilize a distribution channel to serve customers.\nDuring the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, we\n \nrevised our reportable segments to align \nwith how the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer manages the business, assesses performance\n \nand allocates \nresources.\n \nOur revised reportable segments now consist of: (i) Global Distribution\n \nand Value\n \n-Added Services; (ii) \nGlobal Specialty Products; and (iii) Global Technology.\nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services includes distribution to the global dental and medical markets of \nnational brand and corporate brand merchandise, as well as equipment and related\n \ntechnical services.\n \nThis segment \nalso includes value-added services such as financial services, continuing education\n \nservices, consulting and other \nservices.\n \nThis segment also markets and sells under our own corporate brand,\n \na portfolio of cost-effective, high-\nquality consumable merchandise.\n \nGlobal Specialty Products includes manufacturing, marketing\n \nand sales of dental \nimplant and biomaterial products; and endodontic, orthodontic and orthopedic\n \nproducts and other health care-\nrelated products and services.\n \nGlobal Technology includes development and distribution of practice management \nsoftware, e-services and other products, which are distributed to health\n \ncare providers.\nA key element to grow closer to our customers is our One Schein initiative, which\n \nis a unified go-to-market \napproach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with our supply chain,\n \nequipment sales and service and \nother value-added services, allowing our customers to leverage the\n \ncombined value that we offer through a single \nprogram.\n \nSpecifically, One Schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of \nnational brand products, corporate brand products and proprietary specialty products\n \nand solutions (including \nimplant, orthodontic and endodontic products).\n \nIn addition, customers have access to a wide range of services, \nincluding software and other value-added services.\nIndustry Overview\nIn recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.\n \nThis trend has benefited \ndistributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low\n \nprices.\n \nIt also has accelerated the \ngrowth of DSOs, GPOs, HMOs, group practices, other managed care\n \naccounts and collective buying groups, which, \nin addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices,\n \ntend to favor distributors capable of \nproviding specialized management information support.\n \nWe \nbelieve that the trend towards cost containment has \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n41 \nthe potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which\n \ncan enhance the \nefficiency and facilitation of practice management.\nOur operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies\n \nand transactions that we \nundertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the \nhealth care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends \ntoward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.\nIndustry Consolidation\nThe health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented \nand diverse.\n \nThe industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of\n \nrelatively small offices to group practices \nor service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have \ncombined or otherwise associated their practices.\nDue in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage\n \nlarge quantities of supplies \nin their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health\n \ncare practitioners \nhas been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid,\n \nreliable and substantially complete \norder fulfillment.\n \nThe purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically\n \nmade by the \npractitioner or an administrative assistant.\n \nSupplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more\n \nthan \none distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.\nThe trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.\n \nHealth care practitioners are increasingly seeking to \npartner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician \nhospital organizations.\n \nIn many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are\n \nmade at a centralized or \nprofessional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices.\nOur approach to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role\n \nas a provider of products and services \nto the health care industry.\n \nThis trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement\n \nour existing \noperations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired\n \nbusinesses.\nAs industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned\n \nto capitalize on this trend, as we believe we \nhave the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure, although\n \nthere can be no assurances \nthat we will be able to successfully accomplish this.\n \nWe \nare focused on building relationships with decision makers \nwho do not reside in the office-based practitioner setting.\nAs the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible\n \ncandidates for joint venture or \nacquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our\n \nrole as a provider of products and services to \nthe health care industry.\n \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue\n \nany such \nopportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.\n \nIf additional transactions are entered into or \nconsummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there\n \ncan be no assurance that the \nintegration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.\nAging Population and Other Market Influences\nThe health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth\n \ndue to the aging population, \nincreased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology\n \nand testing, new pharmacological \ntreatments, and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment\n \non \ninsurance coverage.\n \nIn addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the\n \nshift of procedures and \ndiagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly\n \nphysicians’ offices.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, between 2025 and 2035, the 45 and older \npopulation is expected to grow by approximately 10%.\n \nBetween 2025 and 2045, this age group is expected to grow \nby approximately 17%.\n \nThis compares with expected total U.S. population growth\n \nrates of approximately 4% \nbetween 2025 and 2035 and approximately 6% between 2025 and 2045.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n42 \nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, in 2025 there are approximately seven million \nAmericans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care\n \nand elder-care \nservices.\n \nBy the year 2050, that number is projected to increase to approximately\n \n17 million.\n \nThe population aged \n65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 15% during\n \nthe same period.\nAs a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care services\n \ncontinue to increase in the \nUnited States.\n \nWe \nbelieve that demand for our products and services will grow while\n \ncontinuing to be impacted by \ncurrent and future operating, economic and industry conditions.\n \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nor CMS, published “National Health Expenditure Data” indicating that\n \ntotal national health care spending reached \napproximately $4.9 trillion in 2023, or 17.6% of the nation’s gross domestic product, the benchmark measure\n \nfor \nannual production of goods and services in the United States.\n \nHealth care spending is projected to reach \napproximately $8.6 trillion by 2033, or 20.3% of the nation’s projected gross domestic product.\nWe \nbelieve similar demographic changes are also occurring in other\n \nmarkets we serve outside the U.S.\nGovernment\nCertain of our businesses involve the distribution, manufacturing, importation,\n \nexportation, marketing, sale and \npromotion of pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices, and in this regard, we\n \nare subject to extensive local, state, \nfederal and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including as applicable\n \nto our wholesale distribution of \npharmaceuticals and medical devices, manufacturing activities, and as part of\n \nour specialty home medical supplies \nbusinesses that distribute and sell medical equipment and supplies directly\n \nto patients.\n \nFederal, state and certain \nforeign governments have also increased enforcement activity in the health care\n \nsector, particularly in areas of fraud \nand abuse, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, controlled substances handling,\n \nmedical device regulations and data \nprivacy and security standards.\nCertain of our businesses involve pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices,\n \nincluding orthopaedic, in vitro \ndiagnostic devices, software regulated as a medical device, and sales of\n \nmedical equipment and supplies directly to \npatients, that are paid for by third parties and/or patients and must operate in\n \ncompliance with a variety of \nburdensome and complex coding, billing and record-keeping requirements in\n \norder to substantiate claims for \npayment under federal, state and commercial health care reimbursement programs.\nGovernment and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical\n \ncare, and there have \nbeen efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs, including efforts, thus far\n \nunsuccessful, to \nseek repeal of the entire United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n \nas amended by the Health Care \nand Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state,\n \nlocal and foreign laws and regulations, \nincluding with respect to the sale, transportation, importation, storage, handling\n \nand disposal of hazardous or \npotentially hazardous substances; “forever chemicals” such as per-and\n \npolyfluoroalkyl substances; amalgam bans; \npricing disclosures; supply chain transparency around labor practices; and safe working\n \nconditions.\n \nIn addition, \nactivities to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering\n \nreimbursement rates for \npharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical supplies and/or medical treatments\n \nor services, are ongoing.\n \nLaws and \nregulations are subject to change and their evolving implementation may impact\n \nour operations and our financial \nperformance.\nCertain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies\n \nand are subject to certain regulatory \nrequirements specific to government contractors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n43 \nOur businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could\n \nimpact our financial performance, \nand failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse\n \neffect on our business.\n \nA few \nnoteworthy items that have come into effect recently are noted below:\n●\nRegulation (EU) 2023/1182 of June 14, 2023, entered into force on January 1, 2025, under the conditions \nset out in Article 14.\n \nThis regulation lays down specific rules relating to medicinal\n \nproducts for human use \nintended to be placed on the market in Northern Ireland in accordance with\n \nArticle 6 of \nDirective 2001/83/EC. \n●\nDirective No. 2025/794 of April 14, 2025, known as the “Stop-the-Clock”\n \nDirective, amended Directives \n(EU) 2022/2464 (CSRD) and (EU) 2024/1760 (CSDDD) by introducing\n \na uniform two-year postponement \nof the sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements for financial\n \nyears beginning on or after \nJanuary 1, 2025 and on or after January 1, 2026.\n●\nRegulation (EU) 2025/327 of February 11, 2025 on the European Health Data Space and amending \nDirective 2011/24/EU and Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 establishes the European Health Data Space \n(EHDS) by providing for common rules, standards and infrastructures and\n \na governance framework, with a \nview to facilitating access to electronic health data for the purpose of primary\n \nuse and secondary use of this \ndata.\n \nThis could potentially affect Henry Schein or its customers.\n●\nIn the United States, as noted above, the OBBBA includes a number\n \nof provisions that are expected to \nresult in reductions in the number of Medicaid enrollees, as well as reductions\n \nin federal funding to state \nMedicaid programs, resulting in potentially adverse impacts on utilization\n \nof services and coverage of \nproducts.\n \nThe OBBBA also includes changes to corporate tax rates, limitations on\n \ncertain deductions and \nmodifications to international tax provisions.\n \nA more detailed discussion of governmental laws and regulations is\n \nincluded in Management’s Discussion & \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual\n \nReport on Form 10-K for the \nfiscal year ended December 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on February\n \n25,

table above.\n \nThe 2.8% increase in internally generated local currency dental sales was\n \ndue to merchandise sales growth in the \nU.S and internationally, and traditional equipment sales growth internationally.\n \nThe U.S. merchandise growth \nreflects the positive impact of the targeted promotional programs initiated last quarter. \nThe 3.0% increase in internally generated local currency medical sales was\n \nattributable to growth in medical \nproducts and pharmaceuticals and our Home Solutions business, partially offset by\n \nlower demand for respiratory \ndiagnostic products and a decline in influenza vaccine sales. \nWe estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits were approximately $146 million for the three \nmonths ended September 27, 2025, as compared to $155 million for\n \nthe three months ended September 28, 2024, \nrepresenting an estimated decrease of $9 million primarily due to lower sales\n \nof COVID-19 test kits.\n \nThe estimated \nincrease in

segment\n \ncompared to gross margin from sales of \nproducts that we distribute within our Global Distribution and Value-Added Services segment.\n \nWithin our Global \nTechnology segment, higher gross margins result from us being both the developer and seller of software products \nand services.\n \nWithin our Global Distribution and Value\n \n-Added Services segment, gross profit margins may vary between the \nperiods as a result of the changes in the mix of products sold as well as\n \nchanges in our customer mix.\n \nWith respect \nto customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed at lower gross\n \nmargins due to the \nhigher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based practitioners, which\n \nnormally purchase \nlower volumes.\n \nThe increase in Global Distribution and Value-Added Services gross profit for the three months ended September \n27, 2025 compared to the prior-year-period was attributable to the growth in internally\n \ngenerated sales volume as \ndescribed above.

purchase \nlower volumes.\n \nThe decrease in Global Distribution and Value-Added Services gross profit for the nine months ended September \n27, 2025 compared to the prior-year-period is due to

for the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared\n \nto 25.1% for the prior \nyear period.\n \nThe difference between our effective and federal statutory tax rates primarily relates to state\n \nand \nforeign income taxes and interest expense.\n \nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2025, the difference was \nfurther impacted by the tax treatment associated with the acquisition of a controlling\n \ninterest of a previously held \nnon-controlling equity investment.\nOn July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the reconciliation tax bill, commonly known as the “One Big Beautiful \nBill Act” (OBBBA), into law.\n \nCorporate provisions in the OBBBA include, immediate expensing of domestic \nresearch and experimental expenditures, limitations on certain deductions,\n \nand

resulting from these developments may result\n \nin changes to long-standing tax principles, \nwhich may adversely impact our effective tax rate going forward or result in higher cash\n \ntax liabilities.\n \nAs of \nSeptember 27, 2025, the impact of the Pillar Two rules to our financial statements was immaterial.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nOur principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions, purchases\n \nof additional noncontrolling \ninterests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs,\n \npurchases of fixed assets and \nrepurchases of common stock.\n \nWorking capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special \ninventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables\n \nand payables.\n \nHistorically, sales have \ntended to be stronger during the second half of the year and special inventory\n \nforward buy-in opportunities have \nbeen most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements\n \nto be higher \nfrom the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of\n \nthe following year. \nWe finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt \nplacements.\n \nPlease see \nNote 8 – Debt\n \nfor further information.\n \nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flows from \noperations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers\n \nfor our products and services, and access to \nproducts and services from our suppliers. \nOur business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which\n \nis susceptible to fluctuations during the \nyear as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.\n \nInventory purchase activity is a function of \nsales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory. \nWe finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.\n \nFunding requirements are based on \nforecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may\n \nchange.\n \nConsequently, we may change \nour funding structure to reflect any new requirements. \nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, \nand our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with\n \nsufficient liquidity to meet our currently \nforeseeable short-term and long-term capital needs. \nOur acquisition strategy is focused on investments in companies that\n \nadd new customers and sales teams, increase \nour geographic footprint (whether entering a new country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we \nhave already invested in businesses), and finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies. \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $331 million for the\n \nnine months ended September 27, 2025, \ncompared to net cash provided by operating activities of $644 million for\n \nthe prior year.\n \nThe net change of $313 \nmillion was primarily attributable to changes in working capital accounts\n \n(primarily accounts receivable,\n \ninventory, \nand accounts payable and accrued expenses).\n \nOur operating cash flows during the nine months ended September \n28, 2024 were affected by the residual impacts of the 2023 cyber incident and included a higher-than-normal\n \nlevel \nof cash collections.\n \nOur cash collections normalized during the nine months ended September\n \n27,

year.\n \nThe net change of $119 million was \nprimarily attributable to reduced payments for equity investments and business\n \nacquisitions. \nNet cash provided by financing activities was $18 million for the nine\n \nmonths ended September 27, 2025, \ncompared to net cash used in financing activities of $306 million for the prior\n \nyear.\n \nThe net change of $324 million \nwas primarily due to increased net borrowings from debt to finance our\n \ninvestments and proceeds received from the \nissuance of common stock, and a reduction in acquisitions of noncontrolling\n \ninterests in
