This discussion should be read in conjunction with MetLife, Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 Annual Report”), the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements included below, the “Risk Factors” set forth in Part II, Item 1A, and the additional risk factors referred to therein, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to our performance measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See “— Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures” for definitions and a discussion of these and other financial measures, and “— Results of Operations” and “— Investments” for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nIndustry Trends \nWe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally due to our market presence in numerous countries, our large investment portfolio and the sensitivity of our insurance liabilities and derivatives to changing market factors. \nGovernments and central banks around the world use fiscal and monetary policies to address uncertain economic conditions. In the United States (“U.S.”), citing growing concerns over the labor market, the Federal Open Market Committee recently cut interest rates. Future policy adjustments could be affected by the U.S. government shutdown. Other central banks have recently held rates steady but are signaling caution as they assess the implications of changing global trade policies on growth and inflation. We are closely monitoring these and other political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives, such as global inflation, supply chain disruptions, acts of war, banking sector volatility and employment and work policies of the federal government. We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs, sanctions or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “— Investments — Current Environment,” as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Impact of Market Interest Rates — Effects of Inflation” in the 2024 Annual Report.\nImpact of Market Interest Rates\nMarket interest rates are a key driver of our results. Increases and decreases in such rates, as well as extended periods of stagnation, may impact our business and investments in various ways. For a discussion of the potential impact of low and rising interest rates, and inflation, as well as management actions taken in response to the changing U.S. interest rate environment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Impact of Market Interest Rates” and “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks” included in the 2024 Annual Report. \nCompetitive Pressures\nSee “Business — Competition” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Competitive Pressures” in the 2024 Annual Report for information on our competitive position.\n104\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Developments\nThe following discussion on regulatory developments should be read in conjunction with “Business — Regulation” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments” included in the 2024 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented.\nState Insurance Regulation\nIn 2023, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) adopted an interim solution with regard to the treatment of an insurer’s negative interest maintenance reserve (“IMR”) balance, which may occur in a rising interest rate environment and can impact how accurately the insurer’s surplus and financial strength are captured in its statutory financial statements due to lower surplus and risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratios. In August 2025, the NAIC extended its interim statutory accounting guidance to be effective until December 31, 2026, which permits an insurer with a company action level RBC ratio greater than 150% (or an authorized control level RBC ratio greater than 300%) to admit negative IMR for an amount up to 10% of its general account capital and surplus, subject to certain restrictions and reporting obligations. These interim changes had an immaterial impact on our RBC. The NAIC is developing a long-term solution for the accounting treatment of negative IMR.\nIn August 2025, the NAIC adopted a principle-based reserving (“PBR”) framework for non-variable annuities, located in Section VM-22 of the NAIC Valuation Manual (“VM”), similar to Section VM-20 for life insurance business and Section VM-21 for variable annuities. The framework for non-variable annuities applies to new issues for valuation dates on or after January 1, 2026, and companies have a three-year optional implementation period before Section VM-22 PBR requirements become mandatory to all applicable blocks of business. The ultimate financial impact from PBR on MetLife is uncertain.\nCertain Non-U.S. Regulation\nIn October 2025, the tax law in Mexico was revised to no longer allow the value-added tax deduction of certain insurance claims-related expenses, including health insurance claims. We expect the value-added tax change to result in a reduction in Latin America’s adjusted earnings of approximately $50 million to $60 million in 2026, with little to no impact in 2027 and beyond. See “— Results of Operations — Segment Results and Corporate & Other — Latin America” for information on the current period notable item related to this industry-wide value-added tax matter.\nStandards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation\nIn 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor’s (the “DOL”) final version of the prohibited transaction exemption (“PTE”) 2020-02 went into effect, which allows investment advice fiduciaries to receive compensation without violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. In April 2024, DOL finalized and published a regulation to change the definition of “fiduciary” for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, and in July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of “fiduciary” and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. The DOL initially appealed these stay orders but has since indicated that it no longer intends to pursue those appeals and, instead, will revisit and re-evaluate the regulation and PTE amendments. Accordingly, it is unclear when, or whether, the regulation and PTE amendments will take effect.\nIn March 2025, Chile enacted the pension reform bill approved by the Chilean Congress in January 2025. This reform introduces structural changes to the pension system, including mandatory bidding of 10% of pension fund administrator customer portfolios every two years beginning in 2028 and the creation of a state-owned entity to manage new pay-as-you-go-contributions. The impact of this reform on our Chilean pension business continues to be evaluated, and will depend on specific regulations that are expected to be issued during the next two years.\nManagement of Climate Risk and ESG\nIn March 2025, the SEC voted to end its defense of final rules that it had adopted in March 2024 requiring registrants to provide additional climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports, including in their financial statements.\n105\nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Regulation and Clearing of Treasury Securities\nIn 2023, the SEC adopted rules to require that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require every direct participant of the agency to submit for clearing eligible secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities. Following a February 25, 2025 extension by the SEC, the rule effectively requires such participants to clear eligible cash transactions in U.S. Treasury securities beginning on December 31, 2026, and clear eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury securities beginning on June 30, 2027. As a result, certain transactions between such participants and us will be required to be cleared. The rule’s potential effect on the U.S. Treasury markets is uncertain.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\n(i)\nfuture policy benefit liabilities, market risk benefits (“MRBs”) and the accounting for reinsurance;\n(ii)\nestimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n(iii)\ninvestment allowance for credit loss (“ACL”) and impairments;\n(iv)\nestimated fair values of freestanding derivatives;\n(v)\nmeasurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n(vi)\nmeasurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n(vii)\nmeasurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n(viii)\nliabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe Company’s critical accounting estimates are described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates” and \nNote 1\n of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2024 Annual Report.\nGoodwill \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount of the difference; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, the Company will consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying value of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected adjusted earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, interest rate levels, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit. \n106\nTable of Contents\nWe apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based may differ from actual future results. The estimated fair value of the reporting units tested can be impacted by unexpected changes in the legislative, regulatory and macroeconomic environment. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests on all reporting units using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The quantitative assessment utilized the market multiple and/or a discounted cash flow valuation based on best available data as of June 30, 2025. The Company concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions \nPending Acquisition of PineBridge Investments\nFor information regarding the Company’s pending acquisition of PineBridge Investments, a global asset manager, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Overview & Strategy\nSee “Business — Business Overview & Strategy” included in the 2024 Annual Report for an overview of our business and strategy. \nOn July 1, 2025, MetLife completed an initial reinsurance transaction with Chariot Reinsurance, Ltd. For more information, see\n \nNote 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n107\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nMetLife is one of the world’s leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into six segments: Group Benefits; Retirement and Income Solutions (“RIS”); Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s segments and Corporate & Other. Management continues to evaluate the Company’s segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nPending Reinsurance Transaction\nOn April 30, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company, a life insurance and annuities subsidiary of Talcott Financial Group, to reinsure approximately $10.0 billion of variable annuity and rider reserves, which are reported in the MetLife Holdings segment. At the closing of the transaction, the Company will enter into a reinsurance agreement on both a modified coinsurance and a funds withheld basis. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2025 and is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nKey Financial Highlights \n•\nNet income available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders of $818 million and $2.4 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to $1.3 billion and $3.0 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n•\nAdjusted earnings available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion and $4.3 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to $1.4 billion and $4.3 billion for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n108\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results\nThree Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nRevenues\nPremiums\n$\n10,555 \n$\n10,647 \n$\n33,088 \n$\n32,328 \nUniversal life and investment-type product policy fees\n1,247 \n1,228 \n3,735 \n3,757 \nNet investment income\n6,089 \n5,227 \n16,635 \n15,868 \nOther revenues\n724 \n648 \n2,090 \n1,960 \nNet investment gains (losses)\n(325)\n(77)\n(985)\n(873)\nNet derivative gains (losses)\n(929)\n767 \n(1,293)\n(720)\nTotal revenues\n17,361 \n18,440 \n53,270 \n52,320 \nExpenses\nPolicyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n10,503 \n10,747 \n33,366 \n32,601 \nPolicyholder liability remeasurement (gains) losses\n(159)\n(132)\n(185)\n(164)\nMarket risk benefit remeasurement (gains) losses\n(263)\n531 \n(241)\n(345)\nInterest credited to policyholder account balances\n2,561 \n2,037 \n6,608 \n6,327 \nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired and negative value of business acquired\n522 \n509 \n1,569 \n1,504 \nInterest expense on debt\n271 \n257 \n798 \n778 \nOther expenses, net of capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n2,716 \n2,497 \n7,811 \n7,378 \nTotal expenses\n16,151 \n16,446 \n49,726 \n48,079 \nIncome (loss) before provision for income tax\n1,210 \n1,994 \n3,544 \n4,241 \nProvision for income tax expense (benefit)\n308 \n653 \n957 \n1,072 \nNet income (loss)\n902 \n1,341 \n2,587 \n3,169 \nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n6 \n(1)\n17 \n14 \nNet income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc.\n896 \n1,342 \n2,570 \n3,155 \nLess: Preferred stock dividends\n66 \n67 \n163 \n168 \nPreferred stock redemption premium\n12 \n— \n12 \n— \nNet income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders\n$\n818 \n$\n1,275 \n$\n2,395 \n$\n2,987 \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNet income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders\n \n-\n \nDecreased $457 million primarily due to the following:\nNet Investment Gains (Losses)\n(1)\n -

The decrease was primarily due to lower premiums from our pension risk transfer business, partially offset by growth in our structured settlement and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) longevity reinsurance businesses. Changes in premiums were more than offset by a corresponding change in policyholder benefits, both of which are reported net of ceded reinsurance.\nThree Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nAdjusted earnings\n$\n436 \n$\n472 \n$\n1,205 \n$\n1,281 \nAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues\n$\n1,186 \n$\n1,579 \n$\n4,971 \n$\n4,974 \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nAdjusted Earnings \n- Decreased $36 million primarily due to the following business drivers:\nMarket Factors \n- Increased adjusted earnings by $77 million:\n•\nVariable investment income increased - higher returns on private equity funds\n•\nInterest credited expenses decreased - impact from a reinsurance transaction, largely offset by growth in investment-type products and certain insurance products \nPartially offset by:\n•\nRecurring investment income decreased - impact from a reinsurance transaction coupled with lower yields on mortgage loans and lower income on derivatives, partially offset by higher yields on fixed income securities and positive flows from pension risk transfer transactions and funding agreement issuances\nUnderwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments\n - Decreased adjusted earnings by $21 million:\n•\nLess favorable mortality \n-\n mainly in pension risk transfer and risk solution businesses\nPartially offset by:\n•\nFavorable change from refinements to certain insurance liabilities in both periods \nNotable Items\n - Decreased adjusted earnings by $91 million:\n•\nCurrent period notable item - favorable impact of $13 million - actuarial assumption review \n•\nPrior period notable item - favorable impact of $104 million - actuarial assumption review\n121\nTable of \nContents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nAdjusted Earnings \n- Decreased $76 million primarily due to the following business drivers:\nMarket Factors \n- Increased adjusted earnings by $24 million:\n•\nVariable investment income increased - higher returns on real estate funds, private equity funds and mortgage loan funds\n•\nRecurring investment income increased - positive flows from pension risk transfer transactions and funding agreement issuances, largely offset by lower income on derivatives and lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans\nLargely offset by:\n•\nHigher interest credited expenses - growth in investment-type and certain insurance products\nNotable Items\n - Decreased adjusted earnings by $91 million:\n•\nCurrent period notable item - favorable impact of $13 million - actuarial assumption review \n•\nPrior period notable item - favorable impact of $104 million - actuarial assumption review \n122\nTable of \nContents\nAsia\nBusiness Overview\n. \nAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for the \nthree months ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\n \nincreased\n \n$7 million\n, or less than 1%, compared to the prior period.

We position our portfolio based on relative value and our view of the economy and financial markets. We maintain our focus on the appropriate level of diversification and asset quality.\nWe manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management (“ALM”) principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with the vast majority of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities available-for-sale (“AFS”) and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities.\nInvested Assets and Cash and Cash Equivalents Subject to Ceded Reinsurance\nThe Company maintains invested assets and cash and cash equivalents that are subject to ceded reinsurance arrangements with third parties and joint ventures. “Reinsurance adjustments” relate to amounts subject to ceded reinsurance arrangements with third parties and joint ventures, including (i) the related investment returns and expenses which are passed through to the reinsurers and (ii) the corresponding invested assets and cash and cash equivalents. Reinsurance adjustments, unless otherwise stated, have been excluded from the amounts within the Investments sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Global inflation, supply chain disruptions, acts of war and banking sector volatility continue to impact the global economy and financial markets and have caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets. See “— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment” for further information regarding conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally which may affect us. These factors may persist for some time and may continue to impact pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, as well as our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. See “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results” and “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Adjusted Earnings Available to Common Shareholders” for impacts on our derivatives and analysis of the period over period changes in investment portfolio results and “Investments — Fixed Maturity Securities AFS — Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS for Credit Loss — Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in an Unrealized Loss Position” in \nNote 11\n of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for impacts on the net unrealized gain (loss) on our fixed maturity securities AFS.\nSelected Country Investments\nWe have a market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our investment portfolio, which supports our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities, as well as our global portfolio diversification objectives, is exposed to risks posed by local political and economic conditions.

However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of provision for credit loss and impairments on our investment portfolio, as well as realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nSee “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results” for an analysis of the period over period changes in realized gains (losses) on investments sold, provision (release) for credit loss and impairments and non-investment portfolio gains (losses).\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nThe following table presents public and private fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities held at:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nSecurities by Type\nEstimated Fair Value\n% of Total\nEstimated Fair Value\n% of Total\n(Dollars in millions)\nFixed maturity securities AFS\nPublicly traded\n$\n212,309 \n72.0 \n%\n$\n201,259 \n72.2 \n%\nPrivately-placed\n82,470 \n28.0 \n77,393 \n27.8 \nTotal fixed maturity securities AFS, excluding Reinsurance adjustments\n$\n294,779 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n278,652 \n100.0 \n%\nReinsurance adjustments\n9,866 \n2,391 \nTotal fixed maturity securities AFS\n$\n304,645 \n$\n281,043 \nPercentage of cash and invested assets, excluding Reinsurance adjustments\n62.5 \n%\n60.7 \n%\nEquity securities\nPublicly traded\n$\n557 \n70.7 \n%\n$\n474 \n66.6 \n%\nPrivately-held\n231 \n29.3 \n238 \n33.4 \nTotal equity securities\n$\n788 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n712 \n100.0 \n%\nPercentage of cash and invested assets, excluding Reinsurance adjustments\n0.2 \n%\n0.2 \n%\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about fixed maturity securities AFS by sector, contractual maturities, continuous gross unrealized losses and equity securities by security type and the related cost, net unrealized gains (losses) and estimated fair value of these securities; as well as realized gains (losses) on sales and disposals and unrealized net gains (losses) recognized in earnings.\nIncluded within fixed maturity securities AFS are structured securities, including RMBS, ABS & CLO, and CMBS (collectively, “Structured Products”).

Over time, credit ratings and designations can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO’s and NAIC’s continuous monitoring process. NRSRO ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings. If no NRSRO rating is available, then an internally developed rating is used. If no NAIC designation is available, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used. NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO, except for (i) non-agency RMBS and CMBS and (ii) securities rated Ca or C by NRSROs, included within Caa and lower, that are designated NAIC 6; accordingly, NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings.\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are presented using NAIC designations for modeled securities.

Our portfolio is comprised primarily of lower risk loans with higher debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”) and lower loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios, as shown below. \nCredit Quality — Monitoring Process.\n We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review by credit quality indicator and by the performance indicators of current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See below for further information on net mortgage loans by credit quality indicator. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information by performance indicator. \n144\nTable of \nContents\nWe review our commercial mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios, DSCR and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher LTV ratios and lower DSCR. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loan investments is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher LTV ratios. Agricultural mortgage loan investments are reviewed on an ongoing basis which include property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios and borrower creditworthiness, including reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. We review our residential mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as nonperforming loans. See \nNote 11\n of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loan investments and related ACL methodology.\nLTV ratios and DSCR are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loan investments. LTV ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loan investments. LTV ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. An LTV ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. An LTV ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the LTV ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the DSCR, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our net commercial mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 69% at both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 and our average DSCR was 2.1x at both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The DSCR and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated routinely. In addition, the LTV ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan investments. For our net agricultural mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 45% and 46% at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The values utilized in calculating the LTV ratio of our agricultural mortgage loan investments are developed in connection with the ongoing review of our portfolio and are routinely updated.\nThe distribution of our net commercial mortgage loan portfolios totaling $45.0 billion at amortized cost at September 30, 2025 by key credit quality indicators of LTV and DSCR was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDSCR\nLTV\n> 1.2x\n1.0-1.2x\n< 1.0x\nTotal\n<65%\n50.0 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n53.2 \n%\n65% - 75%\n15.5 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n0.6 \n%\n18.0 \n%\n76% - 80%\n3.9 \n%\n0.9 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n5.0 \n%\n>80%\n13.6 \n%\n4.9 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n23.8 \n%\nTotal\n83.0 \n%\n9.6 \n%\n7.4 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nThe distribution of our net agricultural mortgage loan portfolios totaling $18.0 billion at amortized cost at September 30, 2025 by the key credit quality indicator of LTV was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nLTV\nTotal\n<65%\n92.1 \n%\n65% - 75%\n7.2 \n%\n76% - 80%\n0.3 \n%\n>80%\n0.4 \n%\nTotal\n100.0 \n%\nMortgage Loan Allowance for Credit Loss.\n Our ACL is established for both pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for mortgage loan investments with dissimilar risk characteristics, such as collateral dependent loans, individually and on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in earnings within net investment gains (losses) in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loan investments that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loan investments being presented at the net amount expected to be collected. \n145\nTable of \nContents\nIn determining our ACL, management (i) pools mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over contractual terms of mortgage loans, as adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Actual credit loss realized could be different from the amount of the ACL recorded. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the ACL to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the ACL. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the ACL. See \nNote 11\n of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how the ACL is established and monitored, and activity in and balances of the ACL.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nOur real estate investments are comprised of wholly-owned properties, and interests in both real estate joint ventures and real estate funds which invest in a wide variety of properties and property types, consisting of single and multi-property projects, and are broadly diversified across multiple property types and geographies.\nThe carrying value of our real estate investments was $13.9 billion and $13.3 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, or 3.0% and 2.9% of cash and invested assets \nat \nSeptember 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nOur real estate investments are typically stabilized properties that we intend to hold for the longer-term for portfolio diversification and long-term appreciation. Our real estate investment portfolio had appreciated to a $3.7 billion unrealized gain position at September 30, 2025. \nWe continuously monitor and assess our real estate investments for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the real estate \nmay be \nimpaired. As a result of our impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment l\noss of $18 million\n and $17 million\n for \nthe nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe diversify our real estate investments by property type, form of equity interest (wholly-owned, joint venture and funds) and geographic region to reduce risk of concentration. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our real estate investments, by income type, as well as income earned.\nOther Limited Partnership Interests\nOther limited partnership interests are comprised of investments in private funds, including private equity funds. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of other limited partnership interests was \n$14.7 billion\n and $14.4 billion, respectively. Other limited partnership interests were \n3.1%\n and 3.1% of cash and invested assets at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Cash distributions on these investments are generated from investment gains, operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds.\nWe use the equity method of accounting for most of our private equity funds. We generally recognize our share of a private equity fund’s earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag, which is when the information is reported to us. Accordingly, changes in equity market levels, which can impact the underlying results of these private equity funds, are recognized in earnings within our net investment income on a three-month lag.\n146\nTable of \nContents\nOther Invested Assets\nThe following table presents the carrying value of our other invested assets by type at:\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nAsset Type\nCarrying\nValue\n% of\nTotal\nCarrying\nValue\n% of\nTotal\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nFreestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values\n$\n7,296 \n43.3 \n%\n$\n8,212 \n44.4 \n%\nOperating joint ventures \n1,608 \n9.5 \n2,006 \n10.8 \nCompany-owned life insurance policies\n1,808 \n10.7 \n1,738 \n9.4 \nAnnuities funding structured settlement claims \n1,242 \n7.4 \n1,248 \n6.7 \nDirect financing leases\n1,252 \n7.4 \n1,228 \n6.6 \nTax credit and renewable energy partnerships\n707 \n4.2 \n714 \n3.9 \nFederal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”) common stock \n700 \n4.1 \n699 \n3.8 \nLeveraged leases\n370 \n2.2 \n623 \n3.4 \nFunds withheld\n486 \n2.9 \n433 \n2.3 \nOther\n1,402 \n8.3 \n1,603 \n8.7 \nTotal other invested assets, excluding Reinsurance adjustments\n$\n16,871 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n18,504 \n100.0 \n%\nReinsurance adjustments\n61 \n— \nTotal other invested assets\n$\n16,932 \n$\n18,504 \nPercentage of cash and invested assets, excluding Reinsurance adjustments\n3.6 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n__________________\nSee Notes 1, 11 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 Annual Report for information regarding freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, annuities funding structured settlement claims, direct financing and leveraged leases, operating joint ventures, FHLBNY common stock, and funds withheld.\nInvestment Commitments\nWe enter into the following commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of our unfunded investment commitments at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. See “Net Investment Income” and “Net Investment Gains (Losses)” in Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, gains and losses from such investments and the liability for credit loss for unfunded mortgage loan commitments. See also “— Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities,” “— Net Mortgage Loans,” “— Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures” and “— Other Limited Partnership Interests.”\n147\nTable of \nContents\nDerivatives \nOverview\nWe are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives, such as market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for: \n•\nA comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.\n•\nInformation about the primary underlying risk exposure, gross notional amount, and estimated fair value of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n•\nThe statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedging relationships for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Derivatives” in the 2024 Annual Report for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives. See also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Management of Market Risk Exposures — Hedging Activities” in the 2024 Annual Report for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses)\nA portion of our derivatives are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those derivatives not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions.\nCertain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits are accounted for as MRBs and measured at estimated fair value. We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. \nWe continuously review and refine our hedging strategy in light of changing economic and market conditions, evolving NAIC and the New York Department of Financial Services statutory requirements, and accounting rule changes. As a part of our current hedging strategy, we maintain portfolio level derivatives in our macro hedge program. These macro hedge program derivatives mitigate the potential deterioration in our capital positions from significant adverse economic conditions.\nSee “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results” for an analysis of the period over period changes in net derivative gains (losses).\n148\nTable of \nContents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nOverview\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the following sections included elsewhere herein for additional information regarding the topics noted below:\n•\nNotes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:\n◦\nNote 3 (pending acquisition of PineBridge Investments);\n◦\nNote 14 (senior note issuances and facility agreement for senior debt issuances); \n◦\nNote 15 (subordinated debt issuance and changes to replacement capital covenants (“RCCs”) of junior subordinated debt securities); and\n◦\nNote 16 (preferred stock, including redemption and the calculation and timing of dividend payments, and MetLife, Inc.’s common stock repurchase authorizations).\nAdditionally, this discussion should be read in conjunction with the following sections included in the 2024 Annual Report for additional information regarding the topics noted below:\n•\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n◦\nNote 3\n (acquisitions and dispositions);\n◦\nNote 5\n (funding agreements, reported in PABs, and the related pledged collateral);\n◦\nNote 16\n (long-term debt, short-term debt, credit and committed facilities, and debt and facility covenants);\n◦\nNote 17\n (collateral financing arrangement and the related pledged collateral);\n◦\nNote 18\n (junior subordinated debt securities and the related RCCs); and\n◦\nNote 19\n (preferred stock and common stock, including the calculation and timing of dividend payments, restrictions on dividends, “dividend stopper” provisions, and MetLife, Inc.’s common stock repurchase authorizations).\n•\nNotes to the MetLife, Inc.

Such conditions may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see “— Industry Trends” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”\n149\nTable of \nContents\nLiquidity Management\nBased upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity” included in the 2024 Annual Report.\nShort-term Liquidity and Liquid Assets\nAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our short-term liquidity position was $19.9 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively, and liquid assets were $181.6 billion and $172.8 billion, respectively.\nShort-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nLiquid assets include short-term liquidity and publicly traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nCapital Management\nWe have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee (“ERC”), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Treasurer, and Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s CFO, CRO and Chief Investment Officer.\nMetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors (“Board of Directors”) and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors prior to obtaining full Board of Directors approval. The Board of Directors approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.\nThe Company\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.\nCapital\nWe manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\n150\nTable of \nContents\nSummary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\nOur primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows:\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nSources:\nOperating activities, net\n$\n10,016 \n$\n9,987 \nNet change in PABs\n5,788 \n2,535 \nLong-term debt issued\n743 \n1,547 \nSubordinated debt securities issued\n1,000 \n— \nOther, net\n— \n140 \nEffect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n309 \n— \nTotal sources\n17,856 \n14,209 \nUses:\nInvesting activities, net\n11,321 \n6,129 \nNet change in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions\n90 \n394 \nLong-term debt repaid\n609 \n1,742 \nCollateral financing arrangement repaid\n78 \n108 \nDerivatives with certain financing elements and other derivative-related transactions, net\n132 \n41 \nNet change in mortgage loan secured financing\n526 \n431 \nTreasury stock acquired in connection with share repurchases\n2,423 \n2,801 \nRedemption of preferred stock\n988 \n— \nPreferred stock redemption premium\n12 \n— \nDividends on preferred stock\n163 \n168 \nDividends on common stock\n1,134 \n1,149 \nOther, net\n215 \n— \nEffect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n— \n120 \nTotal uses\n17,691 \n13,083 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n165 \n$\n1,126 \nCash Flows from Operations\nThe principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense.\nCash Flows from Investments\nThe principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. In addition, cash inflows and outflows relate to sales and purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. \nCash Flows from Financing\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with PABs and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.’s securities, withdrawals associated with PABs and the return of securities on loan. \n151\nTable of \nContents\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nLiquidity and capital are provided by a variety of global funding sources, including: (i) preferred and common stock; (ii) short-term debt, which includes commercial paper; (iii) long-term debt; collateral financing arrangement; and subordinated debt securities; (iv) PABs, which includes funding agreements; (v) credit and committed facilities; (vi) shelf registration statement, which permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities and provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity; and (vii) dispositions. Additional details regarding certain of our primary sources of liquidity and capital are included in the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 Annual Report referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\nThe diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under our credit and committed facilities. As commitments under these facilities may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.\nFacility Agreement for Senior Debt Issuances\nIn March 2025, we expanded our sources of liquidity by entering into a 30-year facility agreement with a Delaware trust (the “Trust”) which gives the Company the right to issue and sell to the Trust from time to time up to $1,250 million of senior notes in exchange for a corresponding amount of U.S. Treasury securities. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nAt September 30, 2025, the Company maintained its unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), as well as certain committed facilities (the “Committed Facilities”). When drawn upon, these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective agreements.\nInformation on the Credit Facility and Committed Facilities at September 30, 2025 was as follows:\nAccount Party/Borrower(s)\nMaximum Capacity\nLetters of Credit Issued\nDrawdowns\nUnused Commitments\n(In millions)\nCredit Facility:\nMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc.\n$\n3,000 \n$\n298 \n$\n— \n$\n2,702 \nCommitted Facilities:\nMetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont and MetLife, Inc.\n$\n350 \n$\n350 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nMetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont and MetLife, Inc.\n2,896 \n2,465 \n— \n431 \nTotal Committed Facilities\n$\n3,246 \n$\n2,815 \n$\n— \n$\n431 \nOutstanding Debt\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding debt at:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nShort-term debt (1)\n$\n378 \n$\n465 \nLong-term debt (2)\n$\n15,300 \n$\n15,086 \nCollateral financing arrangement\n$\n398 \n$\n476 \nSubordinated debt securities (3)\n$\n4,154 \n$\n3,164 \n__________________\n(1)\nThis is all short-term debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc., subject to customary exceptions. Certain subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.\n(2)\nIncludes $359 million and $348 million of long-term debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc. and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”), subject to customary exceptions, at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Certain investment subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.\n152\nTable of \nContents\n(3)\nIncludes $1.0 billion of subordinated debt issued in March 2025. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCertain of our debt instruments and Committed Facilities, as well as our Credit Facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We believe we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants at September 30, 2025.\nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nThe primary uses of liquidity and capital include: (i) common stock repurchases; (ii) dividends on common and preferred stock; (iii) preferred stock redemptions; (iv) debt repayments; (v) debt repurchases, redemptions and exchanges; (vi) contractual obligations, including PABs and insurance liabilities; (vii) pledged collateral; (viii) securities lending transactions, repurchase agreements and third-party custodian administered programs; (ix) mortgage loan secured financing; and (x) acquisitions. Additional details regarding certain of our primary uses of liquidity and capital are included in the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 Annual Report referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock Repurchases and Dividends\nAmong other factors that could restrict MetLife, Inc.’s ability to repurchase or pay dividends on its common stock are the “dividend stopper” provisions in MetLife, Inc.’s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — ‘Dividend Stopper’ Provisions in MetLife’s Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures” included in the 2024 Annual Report.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of $163 million and $168 million, respectively. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its common stock of $1.1 billion.\nDebt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, redemptions and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases, redemptions, or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase or redeem any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or redemptions will be determined at our discretion.\nPledged Collateral\nWe pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by counterparties in connection with our derivatives, the collateral financing arrangement related to the reinsurance of closed block liabilities, and with funding and advance agreements. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivatives.\nSecurities Lending Transactions, Repurchase Agreements and Third-Party Custodian Administered Programs\nSee “— Investments — Securities Lending Transactions, Repurchase Agreements and Third-Party Custodian Administered Programs.”\nMortgage Loan Secured Financing\nSee “— Investments — Net Mortgage Loans.”\n153\nTable of \nContents\nInsurance Liabilities\nLiabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. In the RIS segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the RIS business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at September 30, 2025, there were funding agreements totaling $127 million that could be put back to the Company. \nMetLife, Inc.\nLiquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc.’s access to liquidity.\nMetLife, Inc.’s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Rating Agencies” included in the 2024 Annual Report.\nLiquid Assets\nAt September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, MetLife holding companies had $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $1.5 billion and $944 million were held by other MetLife holding companies at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and the collateral financing arrangement.\nLiquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in “— Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.”\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Consolidated Company Outlook” included in the 2024 Annual Report for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquid Assets” included in the 2024 Annual Report for additional information on the sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow for MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nMetLife, Inc.’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are provided by a variety of global funding sources, including: (i) dividends from subsidiaries; (ii) issuances of long-term debt; (iii) collateral financing arrangement and subordinated debentures; (iv) credit and committed facilities; and (v) dispositions. Additional details regarding certain of MetLife, Inc.’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are included in “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources,” the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 Annual Report referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\n154\nTable of \nContents\nDividends from Subsidiaries\nMetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.\nThe table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid in 2025 by MetLife, Inc.’s primary U.S. insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2025:\nCompany\nPaid (1)\nPermitted Without\nApproval (2)\n(In millions)\nMLIC\n$\n2,185 \n$\n2,732 \nAmerican Life Insurance Company\n$\n200 \n$\n751 \nMetropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company\n$\n760 \n$\n358 \n__________________\n(1)\nReflects all amounts paid, including those where regulatory approval was obtained as required.\n(2)\nReflects dividend amounts that may be paid during 2025 without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2025, some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval.\nIn addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, MetLife, Inc. also received from certain other subsidiaries cash dividends totaling $188 million, as well as cash returns of capital of $12 million.\nThe dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit dividend payments to the parent company to a portion of the subsidiary’s prior year statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including Japan’s Financial Services Agency, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to our first-tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc.\nWe proactively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market.\nLong-term Debt Outstanding\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt of MetLife, Inc. at:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nLong-term debt — unaffiliated\n$\n14,634 \n$\n14,431 \nLong-term debt — affiliated (1)\n$\n1,524 \n$\n1,447 \nSubordinated debt securities\n$\n3,460 \n$\n2,470 \n__________________\n(1)\nIn June 2025, a $250 million senior unsecured floating rate note issued to MetLife Insurance K.K., an affiliate of MetLife, Inc., matured and was refinanced, extending the maturity to June 2032.\n155\nTable of \nContents\nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nMetLife, Inc.’s primary uses of liquidity and capital include: (i) debt service; (ii) cash dividends on common and preferred stock; (iii) capital contributions to subsidiaries; (iv) common stock, preferred stock and debt repurchases and/or redemptions; (v) payment of general operating expenses; (vi) support agreements; and (vii) acquisitions. Additional details regarding certain of MetLife, Inc.’s primary uses of liquidity and capital are included in “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses,” the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 Annual Report referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\nBased on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable MetLife, Inc. to make payments on debt, pay cash dividends on its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common stock and certain of its other securities, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios.\nAffiliated Capital and Debt Transactions\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, MetLife, Inc. invested a net amount of $25 million and $224 million, respectively, in various subsidiaries. \nMetLife, Inc. lends funds, as necessary, through credit agreements or otherwise to its subsidiaries and affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements or to provide liquidity. MetLife, Inc. had loans to subsidiaries outstanding of $135 million and $285 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. In September 2025, loans totaling $210 million were repaid ahead of their scheduled maturities.\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\nIn this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance on a consolidated and segment basis that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance our investors’ understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\nComparable GAAP financial measures:\n(i)\nadjusted premiums, fees and other revenues \n(i)\npremiums, fees and other revenues \n(ii)\nadjusted earnings\n(ii)\nnet income (loss) \n(iii)\nadjusted earnings available to common\nshareholders\n(iii)\nnet income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders\n(iv)\nadjusted net investment income\n(iv)\nnet investment income\nAny of these financial measures shown on a constant currency basis reflect the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and applied to the comparable prior period (“constant currency basis”).\n156\nTable of \nContents\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in “— Results of Operations” and “— Investments.” Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable effort to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income.\nOur definitions of non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies.\nAdjusted earnings and related measures:\n•\nadjusted earnings;\n•\nadjusted earnings available to common shareholders; and\n•\nadjusted earnings available to common shareholders, on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted earnings is used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is our GAAP measure of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and related measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and related measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results\n.\nAdjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends. For additional information relating to adjusted earnings, see “Financial Measure and Segment Accounting Policies” and “Corporate & Other” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, adjusted earnings available to common shareholders excludes the impact of preferred stock redemption premium, which is reported as a reduction to net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders.\nReturn on equity, allocated equity and related measures:\n•\nTotal MetLife, Inc.’s adjusted common stockholders’ equity\n: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding unrealized investment gains (losses), net of related offsets, deferred gains (losses) on derivatives, future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), MRBs instrument-specific credit risk remeasurement gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and the estimated fair value of certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, all net of income tax.\n•\nTotal MetLife, Inc.’s adjusted common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items\n: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding unrealized investment gains (losses), net of related offsets, deferred gains (losses) on derivatives, future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), MRBs instrument-specific credit risk remeasurement gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI, the estimated fair value of certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives and total notable items, all net of income tax.\n•\nReturn on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity\n: net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average common stockholders’ equity.\n•\nAdjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity\n: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average adjusted common stockholders’ equity.\n•\nAdjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items\n: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average adjusted common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items.\n•\nAllocated equity\n: the portion of total MetLife, Inc.’s adjusted common stockholders’ equity that management allocates to each of its segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Economic Capital” in the 2024 Annual Report.\n157\nTable of \nContents\nThe above measures represent a level of equity that excludes most components of AOCI, such as unrealized investment gains (losses), net of related offsets, and future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), as well as the impact of certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, as these amounts are primarily driven by market volatility.\nExpense ratio and direct expense ratio:\n•\nExpense ratio\n: other expenses, net of capitalization of DAC, divided by premiums, fees and other revenues.\n•\nDirect expense ratio\n: direct expenses divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. Direct expenses are comprised of employee-related costs, third-party staffing costs, and general and administrative expenses.\n•\nDirect expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers\n: direct expenses, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfers.\nThe following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance:\n•\nWe sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. Further, sales statistics for our Asia, Latin America and EMEA segments are on a constant currency basis.\n•\nVolume growth, where cited, represents the change in certain measures of our segment results, including adjusted earnings, attributable to business growth, applying a model in which certain margins and factors are held constant, the most significant of which are underwriting margins, investment margins, changes in equity market performance, expense margins and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n•\nPension risk transfers include U.K. funded reinsurance.\n•\nNear-term represents one to three years.\n•\nWe refer to observable forward yield curves as of a particular date in connection with making our estimates for future results. The observable forward yield curves at a given time are based on implied future interest rates along a range of interest rate durations. This includes the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate which we use as a benchmark rate to describe longer-term interest rates used in our estimates for future results.\n•\nNotable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect the Company’s results, but that were unknown and that the Company could not anticipate when it devised its business plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the business plan, to help investors have a better understanding of the Company’s results and to evaluate and forecast those results. Notable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.\n•\nThe Company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife’s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.\nRisk Management\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management” in the 2024 Annual Report for information on our risk management.\nSubsequent Events\nSee Note 22 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n158\nTable of \nContents"
