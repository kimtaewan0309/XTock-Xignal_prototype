Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates worldwide in two segments of the property casualty insurance business:\n•\nInsurance\n - Our Insurance businesses underwrite predominantly commercial insurance business, including excess and surplus lines, admitted lines and specialty personal lines throughout the United States, as well as insurance business in Asia, Australia, Canada, Continental Europe, Mexico, Scandinavia, South America and the United Kingdom.\n•\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n - Our Reinsurance businesses provide facultative and treaty reinsurance in the United States, the Asia Pacific region, Australia, Continental Europe, South Africa and the United Kingdom, as well as operations that solely retain risk on an excess basis and certain program management business.\n    Our two reporting segments are each composed of individual businesses that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or industry served. Each of our businesses is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge. This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our businesses to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and specific customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and compliance support. \n    Our business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities. New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business. Of our 58 businesses, 51 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition. \n           Net premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), for each of our reporting segments for each of the past three years were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet premiums written:\nInsurance\n$\n10,549,550 \n$\n9,560,533 \n$\n8,609,028 \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess \n1,422,546 \n1,393,934 \n1,395,042 \nTotal\n$\n11,972,096 \n$\n10,954,467 \n$\n10,004,070 \nPercentage of net premiums written:\nInsurance\n88.1 \n%\n87.3 \n%\n86.1 \n%\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess \n11.9 \n12.7 \n13.9 \nTotal\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nThirty-three of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (\"A.M. Best\") and have financial strength ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings). A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “A Best's Financial Strength Rating (FSR) is an independent opinion of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. An FSR is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk.” A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.\nOur twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) have financial strength ratings of A\n+\n (the fifth highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).\nOur Moody's financial strength ratings are A1 for Berkley Insurance Company, Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company (the fifth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).\nOur twenty-five insurance company subsidiaries rated by Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\") have insurer financial strength ratings of AA- (the fourth highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).\n6\nThe following sections describe our reporting segments and their businesses in greater detail. These businesses underwrite on behalf of one or more affiliated insurance companies within the group. The businesses are identified for descriptive purposes only and are not legal entities, but for marketing purposes may sometimes be referred to individually as \"a Berkley company\" or collectively as \"Berkley companies.\" Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to “Berkley,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or similar terms refer to W.

A number in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss; a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nInsurance\n \n \nLoss ratio\n62.8 \n%\n62.3 \n%\n61.4 \n%\nExpense ratio\n28.4 \n28.3 \n27.7 \nCombined ratio\n91.2 \n%\n90.6 \n%\n89.1 \n%\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\nLoss ratio\n54.7 \n%\n54.3 \n%\n61.0 \n%\nExpense ratio\n29.4 \n29.4 \n29.2 \nCombined ratio\n84.1 \n%\n83.7 \n%\n90.2 \n%\nTotal\nLoss ratio\n61.8 \n%\n61.3 \n%\n61.3 \n%\nExpense ratio\n28.5 \n28.4 \n28.0 \nCombined ratio\n90.3 \n%\n89.7 \n%\n89.3 \n%\nInvestments\nInvestment results, before income taxes, were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAverage investments, at cost (1)\n$\n28,942,819 \n$\n26,444,111 \n$\n24,438,112 \nNet investment income (1)\n$\n1,333,161 \n$\n1,052,835 \n$\n779,185 \nPercent earned on average investments (1)\n4.6 \n%\n3.9 \n%\n3.2 \n%\nNet investment gains\n$\n117,708 \n$\n47,042 \n$\n202,397 \nChange in unrealized investment gains (losses) (2)\n$\n84,474 \n$\n392,903 \n$\n(1,248,128)\n_______________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes investments, cash and cash equivalents, trading accounts receivable (payable) from brokers and clearing organizations, trading account securities sold but not yet purchased and unsettled purchases.\n(2)\nRepresents the pre-tax change in unrealized investment gains (losses) for available for sale securities recognized in stockholders' equity. \nFor comparison, the following are the coupon returns for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the dividend returns for the S&P 500\n®\n Index:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBarclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index\n3.4 \n%\n3.3 \n%\n2.7 \n%\nS&P 500\n®\n Index\n1.7 \n2.0 \n1.3 \n    \nThe percentages of the fixed maturity portfolio categorized by contractual maturity, based on fair value, on the dates indicated, are set forth below.

Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss.\nIn general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided.\nIn examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among others, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.\nThe risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed.\nReserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Although the loss reserves included in the Company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates, setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.\n15\nThe Company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves. The amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was $1,358 million and $1,352 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate net discount for those reserves, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was $405 million and $390 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, discount rates by year ranged from 0.7% to 6.5%, with a weighted average discount rate of 3.6%. \nSubstantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves (97% of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2024) are excess workers’ compensation reserves. In order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities, reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period. Once established, no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period, and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate, without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized. The expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the Company’s loss payout experience.  \nThe Company also discounts reserves for certain other long-duration workers’ compensation reserves (representing approximately 3% of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2024), including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease. These reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware.\nTo date, known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the Company’s operations, because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language.\nThe Company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to environmental and asbestos claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was $16 million and $17 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues, as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. \nThe table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years:\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet reserves at beginning of year\n$\n15,661,820 \n$\n14,248,879 \n$\n12,848,362 \nNet provision for losses and loss expenses:\nClaims occurring during the current year (1)\n7,083,999 \n6,311,780 \n5,774,713 \nIncrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years (2)\n14,350 \n29,681 \n54,511 \nLoss reserve discount accretion\n33,246 \n30,681 \n32,526 \nTotal\n7,131,595 \n6,372,142 \n5,861,750 \n  Net payments for claims:\nCurrent year\n1,278,585 \n1,217,078 \n1,068,577 \nPrior years\n4,205,845 \n3,764,532 \n3,279,333 \nTotal\n5,484,430 \n4,981,610 \n4,347,910 \nForeign currency translation\n(142,344)\n22,409 \n(113,323)\nNet reserves at end of year\n17,166,641 \n15,661,820 \n14,248,879 \nCeded reserves at end of year\n3,201,389 \n3,077,832 \n2,762,344 \nGross reserves at end of year\n$\n20,368,030 \n$\n18,739,652 \n$\n17,011,223 \nNet change in premiums and losses occurring in prior years:\nIncrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years (2)\n$\n(14,350)\n$\n(29,681)\n$\n(54,511)\nRetrospective premium adjustments for claims occurring in prior years (3)\n18,782 \n10,782 \n18,106 \nNet premium and reserve development on prior years\n$\n4,432 \n$\n(18,899)\n$\n(36,405)\n____________________________________\n16\n(1)\nClaims occurring during the current year are net of loss reserve discounts of $49 million, $47 million and $35 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(2)\nThe change in estimates for claims occurring in prior years is net of loss reserve discount. On an undiscounted basis, the estimates for claims occurring in prior years increased by $13 million in 2024, decreased by $13 million in 2023, and increased by $16 million in 2022. \n(3)\nFor certain retrospectively rated insurance policies and reinsurance agreements, changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums. \n    \nAlso, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and note 13, Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses included in our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in estimates for claims occurring in prior years.\nA reconciliation between the reserves as of December 31, 2024 as reported in the accompanying consolidated GAAP financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) in the Company’s U.S. regulatory filings is as follows:\n(In thousands)\nNet reserves reported in U.S. regulatory filings on a SAP basis\n$\n16,328,835 \nReserves for non-U.S. companies\n922,868 \nLoss reserve discounting (1)\n(92,921)\nCeded reserves\n3,201,389 \nAllowance for expected credit losses on due from reinsurers\n7,859 \nGross reserves reported in the consolidated GAAP financial statements\n$\n20,368,030 \n_________________________\n(1)\nFor statutory purposes, the Company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at 2.5% as prescribed or permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. In its GAAP financial statements, the Company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the risk-free rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate.\nReinsurance\nWe follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better with at least $1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A- (Excellent)” or better with at least $1 billion in policyholder surplus\n.\nRegulation\nU.S. Regulation\n \nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by their domiciliary state insurance departments and are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the other U.S. jurisdictions in which they do business. As of January 1, 2025, there are six domiciliary states related to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\nOverview\n. Our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums, loss expenses and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than our excess and surplus lines and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and \nsurplus lines and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation.\n17\nHolding Company Statutes\n. In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase. Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate domiciliary state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations.\nWe are required to submit to the Delaware Department of Insurance, the lead state regulator for our group, an annual “enterprise risk management report,” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our U.S. licensed insurers. We must also annually submit to the Delaware Department of Insurance an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report (“ORSA Report”), which is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. We are required to, at least annually, conduct an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment regarding the adequacy of our risk management framework and our current, and estimated projected future, solvency position. We must internally document the process and results of the assessment.\nUnder the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) model holding company act adopted by the states,  U.S. insurance regulators are authorized to lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups (“IAIG”). In November 2019, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”), an international standard setter, adopted a global framework for the supervision of IAIGs, as discussed below under “International Regulation.” In December 2024, the IAIS adopted a risk-based, group-wide global insurance capital standard (“ICS”) applicable to IAIGs. IAIS member states, including the U.S., will now update their domestic insurance group capital requirements where necessary to fully reflect the ICS. We received notice from the Delaware Department of Insurance in 2024 that we are considered an IAIG. As an IAIG, we may be subject to international oversight coordinated by the Delaware Department of Insurance.\nIn the United States, the NAIC has developed a group capital calculation tool that uses a risk-based capital aggregation methodology to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in an insurance group regardless of their structure. The NAIC has indicated that it intends to work domestically on its approach to the group capital aggregation method with respect to U.S. implementation of the ICS. Delaware has adopted the NAIC amendments to the model holding company act and regulation that require the ultimate controlling person of an insurer subject to holding company registration to submit the group capital calculation filing annually with its lead state regulator.\nCybersecurity Regulations.\n New York’s cybersecurity regulation applies to financial services institutions authorized by the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “NYDFS”), including our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York. The regulation requires these entities to assess risks associated with their information systems and establish and maintain a cybersecurity program reasonably designed to protect consumers’ private data and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the licensee’s information systems. The NYDFS has adopted amendments to New York’s cybersecurity regulation, which require additional reporting, governance and oversight measures, and enhanced cybersecurity safeguards to be implemented. The amendments take effect in phases that began in 2023 and continue through 2025.\nThe NAIC has adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “Cybersecurity Model Law”) for consideration by state legislatures, which establishes standards for data security, the investigation of cybersecurity events involving the unauthorized access to, or misuse of, certain nonpublic information, and reporting to insurance commissioners. The Cybersecurity Model Law imposes significant regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. The Cybersecurity Model Law, or a form thereof, has been adopted by several states, including three of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states. A drafting note in the Cybersecurity Model Law states that a licensee’s compliance with New York's cybersecurity regulation is intended to constitute compliance with the Cybersecurity Model Law, but compliance remains a state-by-state issue requiring consideration of any state differences in implementation and enforcement of the Cybersecurity Model Law.\nCertain other states have enacted or are considering laws and regulations related to privacy and data security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), broadly regulates the collection, processing and disclosure of California residents’ personal information, imposes limits on the “sale” of personal information and grants California residents certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them in certain circumstances. The CCPA also established a private right of action, with potentially significant statutory damages, whereby businesses that fail to implement reasonable security measures to protect against breaches of personal information could be liable to affected California consumers. California subsequently enacted the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which imposed additional limitations and obligations with respect to covered businesses’ use and sharing of certain personal data. Compliance with the CCPA/CPRA may increase the cost of providing our products and services in California. An increasing number of U.S. states have adopted, \n18\nor are considering legislation similar to the CCPA. Additionally, the NAIC is developing amendments to update the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Regulation to reflect the extensive innovations in communications and technology since its adoption. The proposed amendments would expand the definition of nonpublic personal information; add consumer rights to request access, correction and deletion of nonpublic personal information; and add requirements for contracts with third-party service providers. The deadline to finalize the amendments was recently extended until December 31, 2025.\nWe cannot predict the impact, if any, that any current, proposed or future federal or state cybersecurity laws or regulations will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInnovation and Technology\n. As a result of increased innovation and use of technology in the insurance sector, the NAIC and insurance regulators have been focusing on the use of “big data” technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and automated decision-making. In December 2023, the NAIC adopted the Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers (the “AI Bulletin”). The AI Bulletin may be adopted and issued by state regulators to licensed insurers. In addition to affirming that the use of artificial intelligence must comply with existing state law, the AI Bulletin sets forth regulators’ expectations on how insurers will develop, acquire and use artificial intelligence technologies including around the use of third-party data and models. In 2024, the NAIC formed a new task force to develop and propose a regulatory framework for the oversight of insurers’ use of third-party data and predictive models, the drafting of which is expected to begin in 2025.\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators are also focused on addressing unfair discrimination by insurers in the use of consumer data and technology, and certain states have passed laws or are considering action targeting unfair discrimination practices. For example, Colorado has enacted a law that prohibits insurers from using external consumer data and information sources (“ECDIS”), as well as algorithms or predictive models that use ECDIS, in a way that unfairly discriminates based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity or gender expression. The Colorado Division of Insurance adopted regulations requiring life insurers to adopt a governance and risk management framework for the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technologies that utilize “external consumer data.” In December 2024, the Colorado Division of Insurance released a draft proposed amendment to bring passenger automobile and health benefit plan insurers within its scope. It is expected that Colorado will further adopt governance and testing regulations for other lines of insurance. Similarly, in July 2024, the NYDFS issued Insurance Circular Letter 7 on the Use of Artificial Intelligence and External Consumer Data and Information Sources in Insurance Underwriting and Pricing, which applies to our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York. Circular Letter 7 sets forth fairness principles, transparency requirements, and governance and risk management responsibilities for insurers under NYDFS’ jurisdiction that develop and/or use ECDIS, artificial intelligence systems, and other predictive models in underwriting and pricing insurance policies and annuity contracts.\nWe cannot predict whether states will adopt the AI Bulletin or a similar regulation, or what, if any, changes to laws or regulations may be enacted with regard to “big data” or artificial intelligence technologies.\nRisk-Based Capital Requirements\n. The NAIC utilizes a Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The NAIC RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the calculated RBC target level as of December 31, 2024. \nInsurance Regulatory Information System. \nThe NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios for property and casualty insurers referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios.\nGuaranty Funds\n. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds in states where we transact admitted business when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent company's available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled. The protection afforded under a state's guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state. The NAIC Post-Assessment Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act, a version of which has been adopted by all states, limits assessments to 2% of an insurer’s subject premiums and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business.\n19\nAdditionally, state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability “shared market,” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “FAIR” plans. In addition, some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific mechanism in the applicable state. \nDividends\n. We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.” \nTrade Practices\n. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.\nInvestment Regulation. \nInvestments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. Investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries' calculation of their statutory capital and surplus.\nTerrorism Risk Insurance. \nThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a Federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (“TRIPRA”), the program was extended until December 31, 2027.\nTRIPRA provides a federal backstop to all U.S. based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on U.S. soil or against certain U.S. air carriers, vessels or foreign missions. TRIPRA is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes auto, burglary and theft, surety, workers' compensation, professional liability and farm owners' multi-peril insurance. Insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the United States are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism. TRIPRA's definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism. Federal participation will be triggered under TRIPRA when the Secretary of Treasury certifies an act of terrorism. \nUnder the program, the federal government will pay 80% of an insurer's covered losses in excess of the insurer's applicable deductible. The insurer's deductible is calculated as 20% of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2024 earned premiums, our aggregate deductible under TRIPRA during 2025 will be approximately $1,663 million. The federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed $200 million industry-wide for any calendar year. TRIPRA limits the federal government's share of losses at $100 billion for a program year. In addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the $100 billion cap.\nExcess and Surplus Lines\n. The regulation of our U.S. subsidiaries' excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business, principally with respect to rates and policy forms, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future.\nClimate Change and Financial Risks\n. The NAIC and state insurance regulators continue to evaluate issues related to the management of climate risk. In 2022, the NAIC adopted a new standard for insurance companies to report their climate-related risks as part of its annual Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, which applies to insurers that meet the reporting threshold of $100 million in U.S. direct premium and are licensed in one of the participating jurisdictions. The NYDFS’s 2020 circular letter, which applies to our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, states that regulated insurers are expected to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes, business strategies and scenario analysis, and develop their approach to climate-related financial disclosure. For example, an insurer should designate a board member or board committee, as well as a senior management function, to oversee the management of financial risks \n20\nassociated with climate change. The NYDFS also adopted an amendment to the regulation governing enterprise risk management, which applies to our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, that requires an insurance group's enterprise risk management function to address certain additional risks, including climate change risk.  \nIn addition, the Federal Insurance Office (the “FIO”) is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), as discussed below under “Federal Regulation.” Pursuant to this statutory authority, the FIO is assessing how the insurance sector may mitigate climate risks and help achieve national climate-related goals. In June 2023, the FIO released a report urging insurance regulators to adopt climate-related risk-monitoring guidance in order to enhance their regulation and supervision of insurers.\nIn 2023, California adopted laws establishing climate disclosure and climate-related financial risk reporting requirements that apply to companies doing business in California that meet applicable revenue thresholds. The Company may be subject to the disclosure requirements of the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, requiring entities with more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue to annually disclose emissions on a phased timeline.\nDiversity and Corporate Governance\n.The NAIC and state insurance regulators also continue to evaluate issues related to diversity within the insurance industry, such as the diversity of an insurer’s board of directors and management. In March 2021, the NYDFS issued a circular letter stating that it expects the insurers it regulates, such as our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, to make diversity of their leadership a business priority and a key element of their corporate governance, and it includes diversity-related questions in its examination process. In addition, the NAIC is examining practices in the insurance industry in order to determine how barriers are created that disadvantage or discriminate against people of color or historically underrepresented groups. NAIC goals include improving access to different types of insurance products in minority communities, addressing issues related to affordability, and providing guidance to regulators on ways to improve insurance access and the understanding of insurance in underserved communities.  See “Human Capital Resources” below.\nFederal Regulation.\n The federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, although federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. The Dodd-Frank Act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States, and created two new federal government bodies, the FIO and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”). The FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, although it has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements, as discussed below. The FIO also has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk.  \nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and U.S. Trade Representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance. The U.S. and the European Union (\"EU\") signed such a covered agreement (the \"EU Covered Agreement\") in September 2017, which addresses three areas of prudential supervision: reinsurance, group supervision and the exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. \nIn December 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative entered into a covered agreement with the U.K. (the “U.K. Covered Agreement,” and together with the EU Covered Agreement, the “Covered Agreements”) in anticipation of the U.K.’s exit from the EU. The U.K. Covered Agreement largely reflects the provisions of the EU Covered Agreement and incorporates the same timeframes within it. \nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the FIO has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the Covered Agreements as of September 1, 2022, such as state credit for reinsurance laws that result in non-U.S. reinsurers subject to the Covered Agreements being treated less favorably than U.S. reinsurers. The NAIC amended its Credit for Reinsurance Model Law to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the Covered Agreements, which amendments have been enacted by all states. On September 30, 2023, the FIO reported that it did not recommend taking any preemption action as a result of inconsistency between the Covered Agreements and state credit for reinsurance laws. Under the Covered Agreements, reinsurance collateral requirements no longer apply to qualifying EU and U.K. reinsurers. The amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Law also extends the zero reinsurance collateral provisions in the Covered Agreements to qualified reinsurers domiciled in U.S. jurisdictions that are accredited by the NAIC and to non-U.S. jurisdictions that have not entered into a covered agreement with the U.S. but which the NAIC has identified as “reciprocal jurisdictions” pursuant to the NAIC Qualified Jurisdiction Process. \nWe cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted, and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business, financial condition or operating results.\n21\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the FSOC to designate an insurer as a “systemically important financial institution” or a “non-bank SIFI” if the insurer’s material financial distress could pose a systemic risk to the financial system or the nature or scale of its activities could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. The FIO can recommend that an insurer be designated as a non-bank SIFI, which would subject the company to Federal Reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards. There are currently no such non-bank SIFIs designated by the FSOC. In November 2023, the FSOC adopted final guidance that establishes a new process for designating certain financial companies as non-bank SIFIs. The revised process is based on the consideration of risk factors set forth in a new analytic framework, which describes how the FSOC intends to monitor a broad range of institutions and activities and respond to \npotential risks to U.S. financial stability. The \nfinancial vulnerabilities that most often contribute to this type of risk include leverage, liquidity risk and maturity mismatch, inadequate risk management, concentration and destabilizing activities. Under the new guidance, the FSOC is no longer required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and an assessment of the likelihood of a non-bank financial company’s material financial distress before considering the designation of the company. The revised process could have the effect of simplifying and shortening FSOC’s procedures for designating certain financial companies as non-bank SIFIs.\nBased upon our current business model and balance sheet, we do not believe that we will be designated by the FSOC as such an institution. Although the potential impact of any future amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act on the U.S. insurance industry is not clear, our business could be affected by changes to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as non-bank SIFIs. \nInternational Regulation\nOur insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and/or the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The PRA’s primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders. The FCA has three operational objectives: (i) to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers, (ii) to protect and enhance the integrity of the United Kingdom’s financial system, and (iii) to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets. The PRA and FCA employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives, including periodic auditing and reporting requirements, risk assessment reviews, minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements, dividend restrictions, in certain cases, approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers, approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements.\nOur Lloyd’s managing agency is also regulated by Lloyd’s, and the Lloyd’s syndicate business is subject to Lloyd’s supervision. Through Lloyd’s, we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd’s international licenses. In each such country, we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country. Our insurance subsidiary based in Liechtenstein is regulated by the Financial Market Authority of Liechtenstein (\"FMA\"), which has regulatory tools analogous to those of the U.K. regulators noted above.\nAdditionally, U.K. and Liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as “controllers” of our European-regulated subsidiaries, whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries’ controllers (i.e. persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities) as well as changes of control, and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers. The PRA/FCA’s Senior Managers and Certification Regime and analogous regulation in Liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety, conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers. In addition, certain employees are individually registered at Lloyd’s.\nOur insurance business throughout the EU and EEA is subject to “Solvency II,” an insurance regulatory regime governing, among other things, capital adequacy and risk management. Following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU, or Brexit, our Lloyd’s managing agency (and the U.K. branch of our Liechtenstein subsidiary) are now subject to a separate U.K. prudential regime, which derives from Solvency II but has recently begun to diverge from it. Accordingly, the U.K.’s HM Treasury revoked all U.K. insurance legislation derived from EU law (referred to as Solvency II “assimilated law”) effective December 31, 2024, and broadly reinstated it via additional rules, which will eventually be known as “Solvency U.K.” Additionally, in December 2023, the U.K. adopted legislative reforms that amended various parts of the U.K.’s prudential regime, including the risk margin, matching adjustment requirements and regulatory reporting obligations. The PRA also has amended parts of its Rulebook, to reduce the overall regulatory burden on U.K. authorized insurers and to make the U.K. market more internationally competitive. The PRA’s amendments took effect throughout 2024.\nSimilarly, the EU’s legislative bodies have undertaken a review of Solvency II and have adopted revisions to the current Solvency II rules. EU member states have until the end of January 2027 to implement these amendments into their respective domestic legislation. \n22\nSolvency II provides for the supervision of group solvency. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II. Currently, the U.S. system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II by European Union authorities. The PRA will also perform separate, but comparable, supervision of group solvency under the U.K.’s own domestic prudential regime where a U.S. holding company is a parent of a subsidiary U.K. insurer or reinsurer.\nThe Liechtenstein financial services regulator, the FMA, is the group supervisor for our European-regulated subsidiaries. However, the Covered Agreements prohibit any EU supervisor or the PRA (as applicable) from exercising group- wide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor.\nWe must also comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/879) (“GDPR”), including EEA member state legislation implementing the GDPR. The regulation’s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the EU. The Data Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation, which is the retained EU law version of the GDPR by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (together, “U.K. GDPR”), regulate data protection for all individuals within the U.K. Both the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR are extraterritorial in that they apply to all businesses in the EU and the U.K. respectively, and any business outside the EU and the U.K. that offers services, or monitors the behavior of individuals, in the EU and/or U.K., and that processes the personal data of individuals in the EU and/or the U.K. Moreover, there are significant fines associated with non-compliance. In particular, we need to monitor our compliance with all relevant member states’ laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR are introduced. The introduction of the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR, and any resultant changes in EU member states’ or U.K. national laws and regulations, has increased our compliance obligations and has necessitated the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data, and has required us to change our business practices regarding these matters.\nIn addition, we may become subject to or affected by regulatory policies adopted by the IAIS, an international standard setter consisting of supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions. The aim of the IAIS is to develop and assist in the implementation of effective and consistent regulation of insurer solvency standards and group supervision of insurance groups in response to the increasing globalization of the insurance sector. In November 2019, the IAIS formally adopted a global framework for the supervision of IAIGs, which is referred to as the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or “ComFrame.” ComFrame is intended to provide a framework of basic standards for IAIGs and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of IAIGs. Also in November 2019, the IAIS agreed to a version of a risk-based group-wide global insurance capital standard (“ICS”) that was intended to apply to IAIGs and ultimately form a part of ComFrame. The ICS was adopted by the IAIS in December 2024 as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement for IAIGs and integrated into the rest of ComFrame. IAIS member states will now update their domestic insurance capital requirements where necessary to fully reflect the ICS.\nThe IAIS has also separately concluded that an aggregation method approach to a group capital standard, which forms part of the NAIC’s group capital calculation, could provide a basis of the implementation of the ICS that would produce comparable outcomes to the ICS. In reaching this determination, the IAIS also highlighted certain areas where it will be necessary for the U.S. to undertake further work as part of implementing the aggregation method to ensure convergence with the ICS. The NAIC has indicated that it intends to work domestically on its approach to the aggregation method as the U.S. implementation of the ICS and will collaborate with the IAIS. Once finalized and implemented, the aggregation method could thereafter be used by US-headquartered IAIGs as a method of group solvency calculation. We have received notice from Delaware, our lead state insurance regulator, that we are considered an IAIG. As an IAIG, we may be subject to international oversight coordinated by the Delaware Department of Insurance\n.\nOur international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in Mexico, Australia and Canada and in certain other countries in Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia. Generally, our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations.\nOur international operations are also subject to increasing regulation governing the management of climate risk. In the United Kingdom, the PRA recognizes that climate change represents both an underwriting and investment risk, and that losses can be incurred from physical climate change-related changes and the global adjustment towards a low-carbon economy. Insurers are therefore expected to reflect the consideration of the financial risks from climate change in their governance arrangements, including allocating responsibility for managing these risks to identified senior management and committees. \n23\nInsurers must also monitor and manage the financial risk posed by climate change as part of their risk management frameworks, which would involve scenario testing over a range of time horizons and reporting to the board on identified risks. Financial risks from climate change should also form part of insurers’ public regulatory disclosures.\nSimilarly, the EU’s latest revisions to Solvency II contain specific regulations relating to the management of climate and environmental risks. When implemented into EU member states’ legislation, insurers must incorporate these risks into their own risk and solvency assessments and perform stress testing on the impact of long-term climate change scenarios on their business. Insurers would also need to include information on any material exposure to climate change-related risks in their public regulatory disclosures. The updated Solvency II text requires the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, the supervisory authority for the EU insurance industry, to periodically (and at least every five years) review the scope and calibration of the natural catastrophe risk module used in the standard formula for calculating insurers’ capital requirements using the latest available climate science.\nCompetition\n \nThe property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive, with many insurance companies of various sizes, as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs, transacting business in the United States and internationally. We compete directly with a large number of these companies. Competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer. Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our businesses can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions. Our businesses establish their own pricing practices based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit. \nCompetition for insurance business within the United States comes from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers. Our specialty businesses compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers. Our regional businesses compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers. Additionally, direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional businesses by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company. We compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small, which in some cases are related to government entities, as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies.\nCompetition for reinsurance business, which is especially strong, comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Partner Re and others. \n In recent years, various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, provide increasing competition, which may adversely impact our business and profitability. Further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively. \nHuman Capital Resources\n  \nAs of January 15, 2025, we employed 8,606 individuals. Of this number, our subsidiaries employed 8,474 individuals and the remaining individuals were employed at the parent company. \nWe believe that our people are our greatest asset and that our corporate culture is the most important intangible driver of long-term value creation for our Company and the highest priority for pursuing long-term risk-adjusted returns and growth in stockholder value.\nHuman Capital Management:\n The Company fosters a performance culture. We are focused on creating a respectful, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment that allows our employees to build meaningful and productive careers. The success of these human capital management objectives is essential to our strategy, as it is our people who drive our success. We invest in their growth as individuals and professionals through training and engagement, as well as in their well-being through robust health and wellness programs and a commitment to diversity. \nThe Company provides developmental opportunities for our employees through formal and informal programs that focus on enabling employees to build skills and thought leadership in specific facets of our business. Our leadership programs cultivate the talent of our high-potential, strong-performing employees as we strive to deepen, enhance and diversify the Company’s leadership team. \n24\nWe strive to align employee incentives with the risk and performance frameworks of the Company. The Company’s “pay for performance” philosophy connects individual, business and Company results to employee compensation, providing employees with opportunities to share in the Company’s overall growth and success. The Company offers employees a comprehensive benefits package, including health and wellness, financial, educational and life management benefits. In addition, we support employees in making an impact in their local communities and globally through environmental and social efforts that are meaningful to them. \nOur Board of Directors engages with our senior leadership team, including our senior vice president - human resources, on a periodic basis across a range of human capital management issues, including succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, talent recruiting and retention, engagement, diversity and inclusion, and employee feedback. \nCulture:\n The Board of Directors has recognized Accountability, People Oriented Strategy, Responsible Financial Practices, Risk-Adjusted Returns and Transparency as the elements of corporate culture necessary for the Company to achieve success. Our culture unifies our employees across our decentralized business model, positions us to serve our diverse clients globally and propels the Company’s continuous evolution.\nWe are committed to fostering a unifying culture and encouraging innovation across our enterprise. Our culture encompasses the beliefs that (i) specialized knowledge and having a customer-centric focus are competitive advantages and (ii) an environment that promotes integrity, embraces the commitment to “always do right,” fosters entrepreneurship and innovation, and values making thoughtful decisions for the long-term benefit of our enterprise. While there is no one “Berkley” way, each of our businesses has its own culture that embodies a shared set of values that define our enterprise. Our structure, with 58 distinct businesses, facilitates the prompt identification of and appropriate action with respect to addressing individual business or cultural issues arising within a business, without affecting the larger enterprise. Furthermore, our businesses are overseen by senior corporate business managers and senior corporate functional managers, including actuarial, claims, compliance, enterprise risk management, finance, insurance risk management and underwriting, providing a governance oversight structure that makes it easier to identify such issues. Because our Board of Directors diligently exercises its risk management oversight through, among other activities, regular interactions with employees beyond corporate senior management, our directors have visibility into and receive timely feedback on cultural issues that may affect our business.\nAs significant owners of our Company who are required to hold their shares until separation from service, each of our directors and senior executives have a vested interest in cultivating talent and perpetuating a culture that facilitates the execution of our long-term objectives.\nOther Information about the Company's Business \nWe maintain an interest in evaluating the startup of possible new ventures and the acquisition of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis. In addition, our businesses develop new coverages or enter lines of business to meet the needs of insureds. \nSeasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance businesses. Although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, wildfires, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods.  \nWe have no customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues. \nCompliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. \nThe Company's internet address is www.berkley.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nW. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates worldwide in two segments of the property and casualty business: Insurance and Reinsurance & Monoline Excess. Our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches. It also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics. While providing our business units with certain operating autonomy, our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital, investment, reinsurance, enterprise risk management, and actuarial, financial and corporate compliance support. The Company’s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments.\nAn important part of our strategy is to form new businesses to capitalize on various opportunities. Over the years, the Company has formed numerous businesses that are focused on important parts of the economy in the U.S., including healthcare, cyber security, energy and agriculture, and on growing international markets, including the Asia-Pacific region, South America and Mexico.\nThe profitability of the Company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates. The ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported. The ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural and other disasters, regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses. General insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity, i.e., the level of capital employed in the industry, and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital.\nThe Company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains. The Company’s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities. The return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates, as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities.\nThe Company also invests in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity, loans and real estate related assets. The Company's investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced, and the Company expects to continue to experience, greater fluctuations in investment income. The Company's share of the earnings or losses from investment funds is generally reported on a one-quarter lag in order to facilitate the timely completion of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCommencing with the first quarter of 2024, the Company reclassified a program management business from the Insurance segment to the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment. The reclassified business is a program management business offering support on a nationwide basis for commercial casualty and property program administrators. Reclassifications have been made to the Company's 2023 and 2022 financial information to conform with this presentation.\nOn June 12, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 common stock split which was paid in the form of a stock dividend to holders of record as of June 24, 2024. The additional shares were issued on July 10, 2024. Shares outstanding and per share amounts in this Form 10-K reflect such 3-for-2 common stock split.\n41\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses, assumed reinsurance premiums and other-than-temporary impairments of investments. Management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. \nReserves for Losses and Loss Expenses\n.\n \nTo recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss. \nIn general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided. \nIn examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among other things, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed. \nReserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time, the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. \nLoss reserves included in the Company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations. The Company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each business. These methods include paid loss development, incurred loss development, paid and incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and frequency and severity methods. In circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others, that method is used to set the point estimate. For example, the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data. For new lines of business, where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data, or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices, the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods. The actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered. Industry loss experience is used to supplement the Company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the Company’s own data is limited. The actuarial data is analyzed by line of business, coverage and accident or policy year, as appropriate, for each business. \nThe establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses. These qualitative considerations include, among others, the impact of re-underwriting initiatives, changes in the mix of business, changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions. Examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits, the expansion of coverage exclusions, whether or not defense costs are within policy limits, and changes in deductibles and attachment points. \n42\nThe key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios, rate of loss cost inflation, and reported and paid loss emergence patterns. Expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written, before any actual claims experience has emerged. This expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider. Expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes, loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten. Expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each business. Expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the long-tail lines, such as excess casualty, and claims with a high medical component, such as workers’ compensation. Reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value. Loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses, and are derived from the Company’s own experience and industry data. The paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns. Management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred; however, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. \nLoss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves, including expected loss ratios, rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns. Loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. \nAnother factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag, which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the Company. The length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency (loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags) as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses (less IBNR is required for lines with short reporting lags). As a result, loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates. For lines with short reporting lags, which include auto, primary workers’ compensation, other liability (claims-made) and property business, the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date. For lines of business with long reporting lags, which include other liability (occurrence), products liability, excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance, the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider. Historically, the Company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags. \nThe key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted, to the extent necessary, to reflect the latest reported loss data, current trends and other factors observed. If the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate. The following table reflects the impact of changes (which could be favorable or unfavorable) in frequency and severity, relative to our assumptions, on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2024: \n(In thousands)\nFrequency (+/-)\nSeverity (+/-)\n1%\n5%\n10%\n1%\n$\n142,388 \n$\n428,582 \n$\n786,324 \n5%\n428,582 \n726,110 \n1,098,020 \n10%\n786,324 \n1,098,020 \n1,487,640 \nOur net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately $17.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 relate to multiple accident years. Therefore, the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above. The impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years, as the magnitude of the changes became evident.\nApproximately $3.3 billion, or 19.1%, of the Company’s net loss reserves as of December 31, 2024 relate to the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment. There is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of excess workers' compensation and assumed reinsurance loss reserves. In the case of excess workers’ compensation, our policies generally attach at $1 million or higher. The claims which reach our layer therefore tend to involve the most serious injuries and many remain open for the lifetime of the claimant, which extends the claim settlement tail. These claims also occur less frequently but tend to be larger than primary claims, which increases claim variability. In the case of assumed reinsurance our loss reserve estimates are based, in part, upon information received from ceding companies. If information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct, the Company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate. Furthermore, due to \n43\ndelayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies, the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is also extended. Management considers the impact of delayed reporting and the extended tail in its selection of loss development factors for these lines of business.\nInformation received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios, to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business. This information, which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries, is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies. The Company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the Company. The information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the Company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks.\nFollowing is a summary of the Company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n \n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nInsurance\n$\n13,881,574 \n$\n12,430,202 \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n3,285,067 \n3,231,618 \nNet reserves for losses and loss expenses\n17,166,641 \n15,661,820 \nCeded reserves for losses and loss expenses\n3,201,389 \n3,077,832 \nGross reserves for losses and loss expenses\n$\n20,368,030 \n$\n18,739,652 \nFollowing is a summary of the Company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses by major line of business as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n \n(In thousands)\nReported Case\nReserves\nIncurred But\nNot Reported\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2024\nOther liability\n$\n2,104,721 \n$\n5,164,994 \n$\n7,269,715 \nProfessional liability\n613,230 \n1,503,908 \n2,117,138 \nWorkers’ compensation (1)\n1,054,427 \n771,367 \n1,825,794 \nAuto\n729,462 \n936,319 \n1,665,781 \nShort-tail lines (2)\n410,138 \n593,008 \n1,003,146 \nTotal Insurance\n4,911,978 \n8,969,596 \n13,881,574 \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess (1) (3)\n1,622,399 \n1,662,668 \n3,285,067 \nTotal\n$\n6,534,377 \n$\n10,632,264 \n$\n17,166,641 \nDecember 31, 2023\nOther liability\n$\n1,912,594 \n$\n4,607,507 \n$\n6,520,101 \nProfessional liability\n527,555 \n1,438,102 \n1,965,657 \nWorkers’ compensation (1)\n1,019,445 \n790,944 \n1,810,389 \nAuto\n645,707 \n700,850 \n1,346,557 \nShort-tail lines (2)\n375,129 \n412,369 \n787,498 \nTotal Insurance\n4,480,430 \n7,949,772 \n12,430,202 \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess (1) (3)\n1,673,581 \n1,558,037 \n3,231,618 \nTotal\n$\n6,154,011 \n$\n9,507,809 \n$\n15,661,820 \n____________________\n(1)\nReserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business are net of an aggregate net discount of $405 million and $390 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2)\nShort-tail lines include commercial multi-peril (non-liability), inland marine, accident and health, fidelity and surety, boiler                                  and machinery, high net worth homeowners and other lines.\n(3)\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess includes property and casualty reinsurance as well as certain program management business and operations that solely retain risk on an excess basis.\n44\nThe Company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made. The changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends. \nCertain of the Company's insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated, whereby the Company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity. For those contracts, changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums. \nNet prior year development (i.e, the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes) for each of the last three years ended December 31, are as follows:\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncrease in prior year loss reserves\n$\n(14,350)\n$\n(29,681)\n$\n(54,511)\nIncrease in prior year earned premiums\n18,782 \n10,782 \n18,106 \nNet favorable (unfavorable) prior year development\n$\n4,432 \n$\n(18,899)\n$\n(36,405)\nThe ultimate net impact of COVID-19 on the Company's reserves remains uncertain. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had recognized losses for COVID-19-related claims activity, net of reinsurance, of approximately $381 million, of which $326 million relates to the Insurance segment and $55 million relates to the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment. Such $381 million of COVID-19-related losses included $379 million of reported losses and $2 million of IBNR.\nFavorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was $4 million in 2024.\nInsurance\n – Reserves for the Insurance segment developed unfavorably by $8 million in 2024 (net of additional and return premiums). The adverse development was driven by the commercial auto liability and other liability occurrence lines of business, and was largely offset by favorable development for workers’ compensation, professional liability, products liability, and commercial property lines of business.  \nThe adverse commercial auto liability development was concentrated in accident years 2021 through 2023, while the adverse other liability occurrence development was focused across accident years 2015 through 2022. The majority of the other liability occurrence development was driven by umbrella and excess liability claims, of which a significant portion related to underlying commercial auto exposures. The Company believes that commercial auto-related claims are being particularly impacted by social inflation, which is contributing to an increase in the frequency of large losses beyond expectations. Social inflation can include higher settlement demands from plaintiffs, use of aggressive actions by the plaintiffs’ bar such as litigation funding, negative public sentiment towards large businesses and corporations, and erosion of tort reforms, among other factors.  \nThe favorable workers’ compensation development for the Insurance segment was mainly related to accident years 2016 through 2023, with accident years 2020 through 2023 contributing the most. For workers’ compensation, favorable reported claim frequency, below expectations, continued to be the main driver of the favorable reserve development. The favorable development for both the professional liability and products liability lines of business was related mainly to accident years 2020 through 2023. For both of these lines, reported claim frequency and incurred losses for accident years 2020 through 2023 were better than expected, which drove the favorable reserve development. Business written in these years also benefitted from significant price increases, which the Company now believes will result in higher profitability than initially anticipated.  The favorable development for commercial property was mainly associated with the 2023 accident year, and resulted from better than expected settlements for both catastrophe related and non-catastrophe claims. \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n – Reserves for the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment developed favorably by $12 million in 2024 (net of additional and return premiums). The favorable development was driven mainly by excess workers’ compensation business, partially offset by adverse development in the non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability line of business. The favorable excess workers’ compensation development was driven by continued lower claim frequency and reported losses relative to expectations, and to favorable claim settlements spread across many prior accident years. The unfavorable development for non-proportional reinsurance was concentrated mainly in accident years 2015 through 2019 and was associated primarily with our U.S. and U.K. excess general liability reinsurance businesses, including coverage for cedants insuring construction projects. \n45\nUnfavorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was $19 million in 2023.\nInsurance\n – Reserves for the Insurance segment developed unfavorably by $21 million in 2023 (net of additional and return premiums). The unfavorable development for the segment was concentrated in the early part of the year. A key driver of the unfavorable development early in 2023 was property catastrophe losses related to 2022 events which were still being adjusted and settled during the early part of 2023. In particular, losses related to U.S. winter storms which occurred during the month of December 2022 were a significant contributor to the development, as information gathering and evaluation of many of these claims were still ongoing into the new year.\nIn addition to the property prior year development discussed above, during 2023 the Insurance segment also experienced adverse prior year development on casualty lines of business for the 2016 through 2019 accident years, which was offset by favorable prior year development on casualty lines of business for the 2020 through 2022 accident years. The unfavorable development on the 2016 through 2019 accident years was concentrated in the general liability and commercial auto liability lines of business. The development, which particularly impacted business attaching excess of primary policy limits, was driven by a larger than expected number of large losses reported. The Company believes social inflation is contributing to an increase in the frequency of large losses for these accident years. Social inflation can include higher settlement demands from plaintiffs, use of tactics such as litigation funding by the plaintiffs’ bar, negative public sentiment towards large businesses and corporations, and erosion of tort reforms, among others.\nThe favorable prior year development on casualty lines for the 2020 through 2022 accident years in the Insurance segment was concentrated in the professional liability, workers’ compensation, and general liability lines of business. Due to elevated uncertainty regarding incurred loss frequency and severity as a result of ongoing social inflation and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company set its initial loss ratios for the 2020 through 2022 accident years prudently, and largely maintained these estimates through the end of each respective accident year. The reported loss experience to date for these lines of business for the 2020 through 2022 accident years has been significantly better than was expected, and the Company has begun to react to this favorable emergence as the accident years mature beyond the age of twelve months. It should also be noted that commercial auto liability experienced adverse prior year development for the 2020 through 2022 accident years, which partially offset the favorable development discussed above; the adverse development was driven by a larger than expected number of large losses reported.  \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n – Reserves for the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment developed favorably by $2 million in 2023 (net of additional and return premiums). The overall favorable prior year development for the segment was driven mainly by favorable development in excess workers’ compensation, substantially offset by unfavorable development in the non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability, excess general liability (including umbrella), and commercial auto liability lines of business. The favorable excess workers’ compensation development was driven by continued lower claim frequency and reported losses relative to our expectations, and favorable claim settlements. The favorable development was spread across many prior accident years. The unfavorable development for non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability and excess general liability was associated primarily with our U.S. assumed reinsurance business, and related to accounts reinsuring excess and umbrella business and construction projects. The adverse development was concentrated mainly in accident years 2017 through 2020. The unfavorable development for commercial auto liability was concentrated in the 2022 accident year and related to commercial auto program business.\nUnfavorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was $36 million in 2022.\nInsurance \n– Reserves for the Insurance segment developed unfavorably by $41 million in 2022 (net of additional and return premiums). The unfavorable development in the segment primarily related to COVID-19 losses at two businesses. These businesses wrote policies providing coverage for event cancellation and film production delay which were heavily impacted by losses directly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of this COVID-19 related unfavorable development emerged during the third quarter as a result of settlements of claims at values higher than our expectations. However, the Company believes that\nas a result of these settlements the remaining level of uncertainty around the ultimate value of its known COVID-19 claims has been significantly reduced.\nThe unfavorable development mentioned above also includes favorable prior year development for the Insurance segment primarily attributable to the 2020 and 2021 accident years and unfavorable development on the 2015 through 2019 accident years. The favorable development on the 2020 and 2021 accident years was concentrated in certain casualty lines of business including general liability, professional liability, and workers’ compensation. The Company experienced lower reported claim frequency in these lines of business during 2020 and 2021 relative to historical averages, and continued to experience lower reported incurred losses relative to its expectations for these accident years as they developed during 2022. These trends began in 2020 and we believe were caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including for example, lockdowns, reduced driving/traffic and increased work from home. Due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on accident years 2020 and 2021 incurred losses, the Company was cautious in reacting to these lower trends in \n46\nsetting and updating its loss ratio estimates for these years. As these accident years have continued to mature, the Company has continued to recognize some of the favorable reported experience in its ultimate loss estimates made during 2022. \nThe unfavorable development on the 2015 through 2019 accident years was concentrated in the general liability and professional liability, including medical professional, lines of business, as well as auto liability. The development was driven by a larger than expected number of large losses reported. The Company believes social inflation is contributing to an increase in the frequency of large losses for these accident years. Social inflation can include higher settlement demands from plaintiffs, use of tactics such as litigation funding by the plaintiffs’ bar, negative public sentiment towards large businesses and corporations, and erosion of tort reforms, among others.\n \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n – Reserves for the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment developed favorably by $5 million in 2022 (net of additional and return premiums). The overall favorable development for the segment was driven mainly by favorable development in excess workers compensation, substantially offset by unfavorable development in the professional liability, non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability, and commercial auto liability lines of business. The favorable excess workers’ compensation development was spread across most prior accident years, including 2012 and prior years, and was driven by a review of the Company’s claim reporting patterns as well as a number of favorable claim settlements relative to expectations. The unfavorable professional liability and non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability development was concentrated mainly in accident years 2016 through 2018 and was associated primarily with our U.S. assumed reinsurance business and related to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures. The unfavorable development for commercial auto liability was concentrated in the 2021 accident year and related to commercial auto program business.\nReserve Discount\n. The Company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves. The amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was $1,358 million and $1,352 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate net discount for those reserves, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was $405 million and $390 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, discount rates by year ranged from 0.7% to 6.5%, with a weighted average discount rate of 3.6%.\nSubstantially all discounted workers’ compensation reserves (97% of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2024) are excess workers’ compensation reserves. In order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities, reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period. Once established, no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period, and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate, without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized. The expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the Company’s loss payout experience.\nThe Company also discounts reserves for certain other long-duration workers’ compensation reserves (representing approximately 3% of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2024), including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease. These reserves are discounted at statutory rates prescribed or permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware.\nAssumed Reinsurance Premiums\n. The Company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts. These premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the Company by the ceding companies. As estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised, the related amount of earned premiums, commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded. Estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately $51 million and $65 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements, information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements, reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries. The Company also considers its own view of market conditions, economic trends and experience with similar lines of business. These premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses on Investments\n.\nFixed Maturity Securities\n – For fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position where the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery in value, the amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through net investment gains (losses). For fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position where the Company does not intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery in value, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or all other factors (non-credit factors). In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among \n47\nother factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded for the credit loss through net investment gains (losses), limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The allowance is adjusted for any change in expected credit losses and subsequent recoveries through net investment gains (losses). The impairment related to non-credit factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n    The Company’s credit assessment of allowance for expected credit losses uses a third party model for available for sale and held to maturity securities, as well as loans receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses is generally based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that involve subjective judgments and estimates by management. Modeling these securities involves various factors, such as projected default rates, the nature and realizable value of the collateral, if any, the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments, historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the allowance for expected credit losses, if any. In general, the model reverts to the rating-level long-term average marginal default rates based on 10 years of historical data, beyond the forecast period. For other inputs, the model in most cases reverts to the baseline long-term assumptions linearly over 5 years beyond the forecast period. The long-term assumptions are based on the historical averages. \n    The Company classifies its fixed maturity securities by credit rating, primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. For purposes of classifying securities with different ratings, the Company uses the average of the credit ratings assigned, unless in limited situations the Company’s own analysis indicates an internal rating is more appropriate. Securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the Company on a case-by-case basis.\nA summary of the Company’s non-investment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2024 is presented in the table below. \n \n($ in thousands)\nNumber of\nSecurities\nAggregate\nFair Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nForeign government\n50 \n$\n138,388 \n$\n157,424 \nCorporate\n19 \n50,525 \n2,922 \nState and municipal\n6 \n28,150 \n1,921 \nMortgage-backed securities\n17 \n3,684 \n206 \nAsset-backed securities\n1 \n9 \n1 \nTotal\n93 \n$\n220,756 \n$\n162,474 \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has recorded an allowance for expected credit losses on fixed maturity securities of $0.7 million. The Company has evaluated the remaining fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to temporary market and sector-related factors rather than to issuer-specific factors. None of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants. Based on its assessment of these issuers, the Company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due.\nLoans Receivable\n – For loans receivable, the Company estimates an allowance for expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the amortized cost of the financial asset. The allowance for expected credit losses is presented as a reduction to amortized cost of the financial asset in the consolidated balance sheet and changes to the estimate for expected credit losses are recognized through net investment gains (losses). Loans receivable are reported net of an allowance for expected credit losses of $1 million and $3 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements\n.\n \nThe Company’s fixed maturity available for sale securities, equity securities, and its trading account securities are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as \"the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date\". The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available. The fair value of the vast majority of the Company’s portfolio is based on observable data (other than quoted prices) and, accordingly, is classified as Level 2.\n48\nIn classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy, the Company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable. The Company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information. The Company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers, the uninterrupted availability of such inputs, the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time. If the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable, the security is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nBecause many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis, the Company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. Quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions. For publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable, the Company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data. For securities traded only in private negotiations, the Company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities, which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer, financial data, projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information.\nThe following is a summary of pricing sources for the Company's fixed maturity securities available for sale as of December 31, 2024:\n(In thousands)\nCarrying\nValue\nPercent\nof Total\nPricing source:\nIndependent pricing services\n$\n21,919,679 \n98.1 \n%\nSyndicate manager\n135,129 \n0.6 \nDirectly by the Company based on:\nObservable data\n278,978 \n1.3 \nCash flow model\n19,667 \n— \nTotal\n$\n22,353,453 \n100.0 \n%\nIndependent pricing services\n - Substantially all of the Company’s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services (generally one U.S. pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the Company). The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities). The determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class. The Company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities. If the prices appear unusual to the Company, they are re-examined and the value is either confirmed or revised. In addition, the Company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services. Based upon the Company’s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services, these securities were classified as Level 2.\nSyndicate manager\n – The Company has a 15% participation in a Lloyd’s syndicate, and the Company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager. The majority of the securities are liquid, short duration fixed maturity securities. The Company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices. Based upon the Company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager, these securities were classified as Level 2.\nObservable data\n – If independent pricing is not available, the Company prices the securities directly. Prices are based on observable market data where available, including current trading levels for similar securities and non-binding quotations from brokers. The Company generally requests two or more quotes. If more than one quote is received, the Company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security. The Company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers. Since these securities were priced based on observable data, they were classified as Level 2.\n49\nCash flow model\n – If the above methodologies are not available, the Company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads, interest rates and interest rate volatility, time to maturity and subordination levels. Discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate. These securities were classified as Level 3.\n50\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 \nBusiness Segment Results\nFollowing is a summary of gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned, loss ratios (losses and loss expenses incurred expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned), expense ratios (policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned) and GAAP combined ratios (sum of loss ratio and expense ratio) for each of our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The GAAP combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability, excluding investment income. A GAAP combined ratio in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss; a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit.\n \n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nInsurance\nGross premiums written\n$\n12,662,132 \n$\n11,461,094 \nNet premiums written\n10,549,550 \n9,560,533 \nNet premiums earned\n10,086,308 \n9,007,376 \nLoss ratio\n62.8 \n%\n62.3 \n%\nExpense ratio\n28.4 \n28.3 \nGAAP combined ratio\n91.2 \n90.6 \nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\nGross premiums written\n$\n1,548,958 \n$\n1,510,912 \nNet premiums written\n1,422,546 \n1,393,934 \nNet premiums earned\n1,462,177 \n1,393,311 \nLoss ratio\n54.7 \n%\n54.3 \n%\nExpense ratio\n29.4 \n29.4 \nGAAP combined ratio\n84.1 \n83.7 \nConsolidated\nGross premiums written\n$\n14,211,090 \n$\n12,972,006 \nNet premiums written\n11,972,096 \n10,954,467 \nNet premiums earned\n11,548,485 \n10,400,687 \nLoss ratio\n61.8 \n%\n61.3 \n%\nExpense ratio\n28.5 \n28.4 \nGAAP combined ratio\n90.3 \n89.7 \nNet Income to Common Stockholders\n.

The $375 million increase in net income reflected an after-tax increase in net investment income of $217 million primarily due to higher interest rates, a larger fixed maturity securities portfolio and investment income associated with our Argentine inflation-linked securities, an after-tax increase in foreign currency gains of $65 million mainly due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in 2024, an after-tax increase in net investment gains of $55 million due to change in market value of equity securities and impairment loss recognized on a real estate investment in 2023, an after-tax increase in underwriting income of $37 million mainly due to growth in premium rates, an after-tax reduction in corporate expenses of $15 million, an after-tax increase of $4 million in noncontrolling interests, an after-tax increase in profits from non-insurance businesses of $3 million and an after-tax increase in profit from insurance service businesses of $3 million, partially offset by an increase of $24 million in tax expense due to a change in the effective tax rate. The number of weighted average diluted shares decreased by 6.7 million for 2024 compared to 2023, mainly reflecting shares repurchased in 2024.\nPremiums\n. Gross premiums written were $14,211 million in 2024, an increase of 10% from $12,972 million in 2023. The increase was due to the growth in the Insurance segment of $1,201 million and in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment of $38 million. Approximately 81% of premiums expiring in 2024 and 2023 were renewed. \n51\nAverage renewal premium rates (per unit of exposure) for insurance and facultative reinsurance increased 6.9% in 2024 and 7.1% in 2023. Average renewal premium rates (per unit of exposure) for insurance and facultative reinsurance excluding workers' compensation increased 7.9% in 2024 and 8.1% in 2023. \nA summary of gross premiums written in 2024 compared with 2023 by line of business within each business segment follows:\n•\nInsurance gross premiums increased 10% to $12,662 million in 2024 from $11,461 million in 2023. Gross premiums increased $509 million (11%) for other liability, $476 million (17%) for short-tail lines, $179 million (12%) for auto, $21 million (1%) for professional liability and $16 million (1%) for workers' compensation.\n•\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess gross premiums increased 3% to $1,549 million in 2024 from $1,511 million in 2023. Gross premiums written increased $68 million (16%) for property lines and $28 million (10%) for monoline excess, partially offset by a reduction of $58 million (7%) for casualty lines. \nNet premiums written were $11,972 million in 2024, an increase of 9% from $10,954 million in 2023. Ceded reinsurance premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums were 16% in both 2024 and 2023. \nPremiums earned increased 11% to $11,548 million in 2024 from $10,401 million in 2023. Insurance premiums (including the impact of rate changes) are generally earned evenly over the policy term, and accordingly recent rate increases will be earned over the upcoming quarters. Premiums earned in 2024 are related to business written during both 2024 and 2023. Audit premiums were $350 million in 2024 compared with $363 million in 2023.\nNet Investment Income\n. Following is a summary of net investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAmount\nAverage Annualized\nYield\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFixed maturity securities, including cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable\n$\n1,260,429 \n$\n929,098 \n5.3 \n%\n4.4 \n%\nArbitrage trading account\n69,573 \n69,369 \n5.8 \n5.7 \nEquity securities\n48,920 \n55,726 \n5.0 \n5.1 \nInvestment funds\n(11,491)\n16,743 \n(0.7)\n1.0 \nReal estate\n(23,616)\n(11,185)\n(1.8)\n(0.9)\nGross investment income\n1,343,815 \n1,059,751 \n4.6 \n4.0 \nInvestment expenses\n(10,654)\n(6,916)\n— \n— \nTotal\n$\n1,333,161 \n$\n1,052,835 \n4.6 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nNet investment income increased 27% to $1,333 million in 2024 from $1,053 million in 2023 due primarily to a $331 million increase in income from fixed maturity securities mainly driven by higher interest rates, a larger fixed maturity securities portfolio and investment income associated with our Argentine inflation-linked securities (see below for further discussion), partially offset by a $28 million decrease in income from investment funds primarily due to financial service funds, a $12 million decrease in real estate, a $7 million decrease from equity securities and a $4 million increase in investment expenses. Investment funds are reported on a one quarter lag. The average annualized yield for fixed maturity securities was 5.3% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2023. The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 2.6 years at December 31, 2024 and 2.4 years at December 31, 2023. Average invested assets, at cost (including cash and cash equivalents), were $28.9 billion in 2024 up 9.5% from $26.4 billion in 2023.\nPre-tax net investment income associated with the Argentine inflation-linked securities in 2024 was $204 million. Such investment income increased as a result of an adjustment to the inflation rate that was made by the Argentine government in late 2023. As certain of our Argentine bonds matured and were sold throughout 2024 and the inflation rate continued to decline, we do not expect investment income relating to these securities to continue at this level. The proceeds from the Argentine inflation-linked securities that matured and were sold in 2024 have been reinvested.\nInsurance Service Fees\n. The Company earns fees from an insurance distribution business (part of which was sold in June 2023), a third-party administrator, and as a servicing carrier of workers' compensation assigned risk plans for certain states. Insurance service fees increased to $109 million in 2024 from $106 million in 2023 due to an acquisition in the insurance distribution business in late 2023. \nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\n. The Company buys and sells securities and other investment assets on a regular basis in order to maximize its total return on investments. Decisions to sell securities and other \n52\ninvestment assets are based on management’s view of the underlying fundamentals of specific investments as well as management’s expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads, currency values and general economic conditions. Net realized and unrealized gains on investments were $80 million in 2024 compared with $48 million in 2023. In 2024, the gains reflected a change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $121 million, partially offset by net realized losses on investments of $41 million. In 2023, the gains reflected a change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $71 million, partially offset by net realized losses on investments of $23 million.\nChange in Allowance for Expected Credit Losses on Investments.\n Based on credit factors, the allowance for expected credit losses is increased or decreased depending on the percentage of unrealized loss relative to amortized cost by security, changes in rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. The pre-tax change in allowance for expected credit losses on investments reflected in net investment gains, decreased by $38 million ($30 million after-tax) in 2024 due to improved pricing associated with foreign government securities and corporate securities, and increased by $498 thousand ($393 thousand after-tax) in 2023.\nRevenues from Non-Insurance Businesses\n. Revenues from non-insurance businesses were derived from businesses engaged in the distribution of promotional merchandise, world-wide textile solutions, and aviation-related businesses that provide services to aviation markets, including (i) the distribution, manufacturing, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and components, (ii) the sale of new and used aircraft, and (iii) avionics, fuel, maintenance, storage and charter services. Revenues from non-insurance businesses decreased to $528 million in 2024 from $536 million in 2023 mainly due to the aviation-related business and the promotional merchandise business.\nLosses and Loss Expenses\n. Losses and loss expenses increased to $7,132 million in 2024 from $6,372 million in 2023. The consolidated loss ratio was 61.8% in 2024 and 61.3% in 2023. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, were $298 million in 2024 driven by heightened frequency of severe catastrophe events, with Hurricanes Helene and Milton having the largest impacts, and $195 million in 2023. Favorable prior year reserve development (net of premium offsets) was $4 million in 2024 and adverse prior year reserve development was $19 million in 2023 (refer to Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for more detail). The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development were 59.2% in both 2024 and 2023.\nA summary of loss ratios in 2024 compared with 2023 by business segment follows:\n•\nInsurance\n - The loss ratio was 62.8% in 2024 and 62.3% in 2023. Catastrophe losses were $227 million in 2024 compared with $160 million in 2023. Adverse prior year reserve development was $8 million in 2024 and $21 million in 2023, principally from property catastrophe losses for 2023. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development increased 0.2 points to 60.5% in 2024 from 60.3% in 2023. \n•\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n - The loss ratio was 54.7% in 2024 and 54.3% in 2023. Catastrophe losses were $71 million in 2024 compared with $35 million in 2023. Favorable prior year reserve development was $12 million in 2024 and $2 million in 2023. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development decreased 1.3 points to 50.6% in 2024 from 51.9% in 2023. \nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\n. Following is a summary of other operating costs and expenses: \n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nPolicy acquisition and insurance operating expenses\n$\n3,294,902 \n$\n2,954,686 \nInsurance service expenses\n90,640 \n91,714 \nNet foreign currency (gains) losses\n(52,376)\n31,799 \nOther costs and expenses\n269,140 \n285,737 \nTotal\n$\n3,602,306 \n$\n3,363,936 \nPolicy acquisition and insurance operating expenses are comprised of commissions paid to agents and brokers, premium taxes and other assessments and internal underwriting costs. Policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses increased 12% and net premiums earned increased 11% from 2023. The expense ratio (policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned) increased by 0.1 points to 28.5% in 2024 from 28.4% in 2023.\nService expenses, which represent the costs associated with the fee-based businesses, was $91 million in 2024 compared to $92 million in 2023. \n53\nNet foreign currency (gains) losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than a businesses’ functional currency. Net foreign currency gains were $52 million in 2024 compared to losses of $32 million in 2023, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against other major currencies in 2024.\nOther costs and expenses represent general and administrative expenses of the parent company and other expenses not allocated to business segments, including the cost of certain long-term incentive plans and new business ventures. Other costs and expenses decreased to $269 million in 2024 from $286 million in 2023, primarily due to lower new start-up operating unit expenses in 2024. \nExpenses from Non-Insurance Businesses\n. Expenses from non-insurance businesses represent costs associated with businesses engaged in the distribution of promotional merchandise, world-wide textile solutions, and aviation-related businesses that include (i) cost of goods sold related to aircraft and products sold and services provided and (ii) general and administrative expenses. Expenses from non-insurance businesses decreased to $513 million in 2024 from $525 million in 2023, primarily due to the aviation-related business and promotional merchandise business.\nInterest Expense\n. Interest expense was $127 million in both 2024 and 2023.\nIncome Taxes.\n The effective income tax rate was 22.5% in 2024 and 21.1% in 2023. The higher effective income tax rate for the year, as compared to 2023, was primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings and larger amounts being subject to tax at a rate greater than the U.S. statutory rate, which was partially offset by tax benefits related to tax-exempt investment income and equity-based compensation. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the income tax expense and the amounts computed by applying the Federal income tax rate of 21%.\nThe Company has not provided U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately $481 million of its non-U.S. subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the future, if such earnings were distributed, the Company projects that the incremental tax, if any, will be immaterial.\nFor years beginning after December 31, 2025, certain U.S. tax rates applied to international business will change.  Specifically, increases to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income and the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax rates will take effect.  We do not expect this to have a meaningful impact to tax expense. We are actively monitoring legislative developments and will continue to assess the potential financial implications in 2025.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted. Among other things, the legislation introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax on certain corporations. The tax is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 and imposes a 15% minimum tax on a corporation’s applicable financial statement income. While we are not subject to this tax in 2024, we continue to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal income tax position. In addition, a 1% excise tax is now imposed on the value of corporate share repurchases, net of common share issuances. The tax is included in the cost of treasury stock acquired and was not material for 2024.  \nFurther, the Company is monitoring the impact of the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of 15%, also known as Pillar Two, as introduced by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which applies in some countries commencing in 2024. The 2024 impact was not material, as the Company mainly operates in jurisdictions with a statutory tax rate above 15%. We continue to evaluate this tax legislation as it will apply to other countries commencing in 2025, as well as possible interactions between Pillar Two measures and recent and potential future actions by the new U.S. administration. Our initial assessment is that the 2025 impact will not be significant.\nThe “Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023” was passed into law December 27, 2023. The income tax will be based on a statutory tax rate of 15% on Bermuda businesses, subject to reductions for foreign tax credits, and will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The legislation does not have a material impact on our income tax position. We will continue to evaluate tax legislation developments during 2025. \nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nFor a comparison of the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2022, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2024.\n54\nInvestments\nAs part of its investment strategy, the Company establishes a level of cash and highly liquid short-term and intermediate-term securities that, combined with expected cash flow, it believes is adequate to meet its payment obligations. In addition to fixed maturity securities, the Company invests in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity, loans and real estate related assets. The Company's investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced, and the Company expects to continue to experience, greater fluctuations in investment income. \nThe Company also attempts to maintain an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities (i.e., policy claims and debt obligations). The effective duration of the investment portfolio was 2.6 years and 2.4 years at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s investment portfolio and investment-related assets as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n($ in thousands)\nCarrying\nValue\nPercent\nof Total\nFixed maturity securities:\nU.S. government and government agencies\n$\n2,235,341 \n7.5 \n%\nState and municipal:\nSpecial revenue\n1,517,708 \n5.1 \nState general obligation\n307,514 \n1.0 \nLocal general obligation\n272,376 \n0.9 \nCorporate backed\n153,574 \n0.5 \nPre-refunded (1)\n85,592 \n0.3 \nTotal state and municipal\n2,336,764 \n7.8 \nMortgage-backed securities:\nAgency\n3,045,639 \n10.2 \nCommercial\n532,282 \n1.8 \nResidential-Prime\n187,806 \n0.6 \nResidential-Alt A\n2,055 \n— \nTotal mortgage-backed securities\n3,767,782 \n12.6 \nAsset-backed securities\n3,885,012 \n13.0 \nCorporate:\nIndustrial\n3,667,199 \n12.3 \nFinancial\n3,320,513 \n11.1 \nUtilities\n778,694 \n2.6 \nOther\n651,235 \n2.2 \nTotal corporate\n8,417,641 \n28.2 \nForeign government\n1,755,325 \n5.9 \nTotal fixed maturity securities\n22,397,865 \n75.0 \nEquity securities available for sale:\nCommon stocks\n760,167 \n2.5 \nPreferred stocks\n443,621 \n1.5 \nTotal equity securities available for sale\n1,203,788 \n4.0 \nCash and cash equivalents\n1,974,747 \n6.6 \nInvestment funds\n1,468,246 \n4.9 \nReal estate\n1,291,455 \n4.3 \nArbitrage trading account\n1,122,599 \n3.8 \nLoans receivable\n405,453 \n1.4 \nTotal investments\n$\n29,864,153 \n100.0 \n%\n______________\n(1)\nPre-refunded securities are securities for which an escrow account has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest through maturity. Such escrow accounts are funded almost exclusively with U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities.\nFixed Maturity Securities\n. The Company’s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity. However, management of the available for sale \n55\nportfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations.\nThe Company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return. The key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads and currency values. In a period in which management expects interest rates to rise, the Company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio. Similarly, in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen, the Company may sell lower quality securities, and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value, the Company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies. The sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains (losses); however, there is no reason to expect these gains (losses) to continue in future periods.\nEquity Securities\n. Equity securities primarily represent investments in common and preferred stocks in companies with potential growth opportunities in different sectors, mainly in the financial institutions and energy sectors.\nInvestment Funds\n. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of investment funds was $1,468 million, including investments in financial services funds of $430 million, other funds of $379 million (which includes a deferred compensation trust asset of $38 million), transportation funds of $286 million, real estate funds of $179 million, infrastructure funds of $151 million and energy funds of $43 million. Investment funds are primarily reported on a one-quarter lag.\nReal Estate\n. Real estate is directly owned property held for investment. At December 31, 2024, real estate properties in operation included a long-term ground lease in Washington D.C., an office complex in New York City and the completed portion of a mixed-use project in Washington D.C. In addition, part of the previously mentioned mixed-use project in Washington D.C. is under development. The Company expects to fund further development costs for the project with a combination of its own funds and external financing. \nArbitrage Trading Account\n. The arbitrage trading account is comprised of direct investments in arbitrage securities. Merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers.\nLoans Receivable.\n Loans receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, had both an amortized cost and an aggregate fair value of $405 million at December 31, 2024. The amortized cost of loans receivable is net of an allowance for expected credit losses of $1 million as of December 31, 2024. Loans receivable include real estate loans of $402 million that are secured by commercial and residential real estate located primarily in the U.K. and New York. Real estate loans generally earn interest at fixed or stepped interest rates and have maturities through 2028. Loans receivable include commercial loans of $3 million that are secured by business assets and have fixed interest rates with varying maturities not exceeding 5 years.\n56\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow\n. Cash flow provided from operating activities increased to $3,678 million in 2024 from $2,929 million in 2023, primarily due to an increase in premium receipts partially offset by increased loss and loss expense payments.\nThe Company's insurance subsidiaries' principal sources of cash are premiums, investment income, service fees and proceeds from sales and maturities of portfolio investments. The principal uses of cash are payments for claims, taxes, operating expenses and dividends. The Company expects its insurance subsidiaries to fund the payment of losses with cash received from premiums, investment income and fees. The Company generally targets an average duration for its investment portfolio that is within 1.5 years of the average number of years held for its liabilities so that portions of its investment portfolio mature throughout the claim cycle and are available for the payment of claims if necessary. In the event operating cash flow and proceeds from maturities and prepayments of fixed maturity securities are not sufficient to fund claim payments and other cash requirements, the remainder of the Company's cash and investments is available to pay claims and other obligations as they become due. The Company's investment portfolio is highly liquid, with approximately 82% invested in cash, cash equivalents and marketable fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2024. If the sale of fixed maturity securities were to become necessary, a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the cost and sales price of securities sold would be recognized. \nDebt\n. At December 31, 2024, the Company had senior notes, subordinated debentures and other debt outstanding with a carrying value of $2,841 million and a face amount of $2,864 million. The maturities of the outstanding debt are $9 million in 2025, $250 million in 2037, $350 million in 2044, $470 million in 2050, $400 million in 2052, $185 million in 2058, $300 million in 2059, $250 million in 2060, and $650 million in 2061.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for revolving, unsecured borrowings up to an aggregate of $300 million with a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Company may increase the amount available under the facility to a maximum of $500 million subject to obtaining lender commitments for the increase and other customary conditions. Borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. All borrowings under the facility must be repaid by April 1, 2027, except that letters of credit outstanding on that date may remain outstanding until April 1, 2028 (or such later date approved by all lenders). Our ability to utilize the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of representations, warranties and covenants that are customary for facilities of this type. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility.\nEquity\n. At December 31, 2024, total common stockholders’ equity was $8.4 billion, common shares outstanding were 380,066,070 and stockholders’ equity per outstanding share was $22.09. The Company repurchased 5,702,996 and 13,061,514 shares of its common stock in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate cost of the repurchases was $304 million in 2024 and $537 million in 2023. In 2024, the Board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in the first quarter and $0.08 per share in each of the remaining three quarters, as well as special dividends of $0.33 per share, $0.25 per share and $0.50 per share in the second, third, and fourth quarters, respectively, for a total of $532 million in aggregate dividends in 2024. \nTotal Capital\n.\n \nTotal capitalization (equity, debt and subordinated debentures) was $11.2 billion at December 31, 2024. The percentage of the Company’s capital attributable to senior notes, subordinated debentures and other debt was 25% and 28% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFederal and Foreign Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return in the U.S. and foreign tax returns in each of the countries in which it has overseas operations. At December 31, 2024, the Company had a gross deferred tax asset of $715 million (which primarily relates to, loss and loss expense reserves, unearned premium reserves, employee compensation plans and unrealized losses on investments). The Company also has a $36 million valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax asset and a gross deferred tax liability of $524 million (which primarily relates to deferred policy acquisition costs, and various investment funds) resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $155 million. The realization of this asset is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. Based on historical results and the prospects for future operations, management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset.\n57\nReinsurance \nThe Company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes. Reinsurance is purchased by the Company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. The Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages with only financially sound carriers. Reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business, location of the risk and nature of loss. The Company’s reinsurance purchases include the following:\n•\nProperty reinsurance treaties - The Company purchases property reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large individual property losses and catastrophe events. Following is a summary of significant property reinsurance treaties in effect as of January 1, 2025: \n◦\nThe Company’s property per risk reinsurance generally covers losses between $2.5 million and $85 million. \n◦\nThe Company’s property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program provides protection for business written by its Insurance segments and U.S. and non-U.S. business written by Lloyd's Syndicate, excluding offshore energy. For 2025, some of our property catastrophe reinsurance is placed via industry loss warranty (ILW) covers and the equivalent W. R. Berkley limit and retention (and resulting net position) are estimated based on our market share and modeled outcome when applying the ILW layering. Retentions by territory and peril range between $46.3 million and $74.0 million. Limits purchased are the difference between the corresponding retentions and $700 million.\n•\nCasualty reinsurance treaties - The Company purchases casualty reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large individual casualty losses and workers’ compensation catastrophe losses for the majority of business written by its U.S. companies. A casualty contingency treaty, in effect as of January 1, 2025, provides protection for bad faith and runaway loss adjustment expense losses in excess of $10 million and up to $75 million. For losses involving two or more claimants for primary workers’ compensation business, coverage is generally in place for losses between $10 million and $500 million. For excess workers’ compensation business, such coverage is generally in place for losses between $25 million and $500 million. Our workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance program is a shared cover for both excess and primary workers’ compensation business.\n•\nFacultative reinsurance - The Company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain individual policies or risks that are in excess of treaty reinsurance capacity. \n•\nOther reinsurance - Depending on the business, the Company purchases specific additional reinsurance to supplement the above programs.\n•\nLifson Re is expected to continue to be a participant on the majority of the Company’s reinsurance placements. Effective January 1, 2025, Lifson Re participates in a 32.5% share of the placed amounts, increased from 30.0% in the prior year. This pertains to all traditional treaty reinsurance/retrocessional placements for both property and casualty business where there is more than one open market reinsurer participating. Lifson Re is currently capitalized with $418 million of equity from a small group of sophisticated global investors with long-term investment horizons, including a minority participation by the Company. Lifson Re participates on a fully collateralized basis.\nThe Company places a number of its casualty treaties on a “risk attaching” basis. Under risk attaching treaties, all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract. If the Company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage, protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration. In such case, the Company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection. The casualty contingency treaty highlighted above is purchased on a “losses discovered” basis. Property catastrophe and workers’ compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a “losses occurring basis,” whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered. If the Company is unable to renew or replace these reinsurance coverages, unexpired policies would not be protected, though we generally have the option to purchase run-off coverage in our treaties. \nFollowing is a summary of earned premiums and loss and loss expenses ceded to reinsurers for each of the three years ended December 31, 2024:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEarned premiums\n$\n2,163,213 \n$\n1,958,581 \n$\n1,883,263 \nLosses and loss expenses\n1,368,279 \n1,376,144 \n1,269,338 \n58\nCeded earned premiums increased 10% in 2024 to $2,163 million.

Insurers can fulfill this residual market obligation by participating in pools where results are shared by the participating companies. The Company acts as a servicing carrier for workers' compensation pools in certain states. As a servicing carrier, the Company writes residual market business directly and then cedes 100% of this business to the respective pool. As a servicing carrier, the Company receives fee income for its services. The Company does not retain underwriting risk, and credit risk is limited as ceded balances are jointly shared by all the pool members. \n59\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the Company. The Company has no arrangements of these types that management believes may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\n60",
