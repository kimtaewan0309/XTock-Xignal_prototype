Offering the combination of primary proprietary packaging components, containment solutions, and drug delivery devices, as well as a broad range of integrated services, helps to position us as a leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines.\nThis reportable segment has manufacturing facilities in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, with affiliated companies in Mexico and Japan. Please refer to Item 2, \nProperties\n, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.\n4\nContract-Manufactured Products Segment\nOur Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. These products include a variety of custom contract-manufacturing and assembly solutions, which use technologies such as multi-component molding, in-mold labeling, ultrasonic welding, clean room molding, device assembly, and drug handling capabilities. We manufacture customer-owned components and devices used in surgical, diagnostic, ophthalmic, injectable, and other drug delivery systems, as well as consumer products.\nWe have vast expertise in product design and development, including in-house mold design, process design and validation and high-speed automated assemblies.\nThis reportable segment has manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe. Please refer to Item 2, \nProperties\n, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.\nInternational\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States (“U.S.”), which are managed through the same business segments as our U.S. operations – Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Sales outside of the U.S. accounted for 57.5% of our net sales in 2024.\nAlthough the general business processes are similar to the domestic business, international operations are exposed to additional risks. These risks include currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. Dollar (“USD”) and multiple tax jurisdictions.\nSee further discussion of our international operations, the risks associated with our international operations, and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in Part I, Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n;\n Part II, Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nunder the caption \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; \nPart II, Item 7A, \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n;\n Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nunder the captions \nFinancial Instruments\n and \nForeign Currency Translation; \nand Note 11, \nDerivative Financial Instruments\n.\nRaw Materials\nWe use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products: elastomers, aluminum and plastic. Elastomers include both synthetic and natural materials. We currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers. We are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements. In addition, some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders, which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption.\nWe employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments, which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply. Due to regulatory control over our production processes, sole source availability, and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers, we rely on single-source suppliers for many critical raw materials. We generally purchase certain raw materials in the open market and therefore the results of our operations may be affected by price fluctuations. This strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem. These risks are managed, when and where possible, by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites, rigorous quality control systems, surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution. Heightened inflation may result in unfavorable conditions, inclusive of an increase in raw material cost. To date, we have been able to manage these conditions without significant disruption to our business.\nWhile we work closely with our suppliers, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful, and there may be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. See further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n.\n5\nIntellectual Property\nOur intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and trade secrets, is important to our business. We own or license intellectual property rights, including know-how and issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries, which relate to various aspects of our business. In 2024, more than 170 utility and design patents were issued to West across the globe. Certain key value-added and proprietary products and processes are exclusively licensed from Daikyo. We believe, however, that neither our business nor any business segment is wholly dependent on a single intellectual property asset, license, or technology, by itself. \nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, anti-corruption, export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas. The design, development, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency and the National Medical Products Administration (China). Regulatory authorities, including regulatory review and oversight, can impact the time and cost associated with the development and continued availability of our products, and they have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against West. Compliance with existing and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and may require changes to our information technologies, systems and practices.\nChanges in tax policy or trade regulations, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations did not require material capital expenditures in 2024 and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position in 2025 as compared to prior periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see \"Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n.\n\" There were no required material capital expenditures for adherence to our government-led regulatory standards in our facilities in 2024 outside the normal course of business, and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2025.\nWest is also subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning fraud and abuse, global anti-corruption, and export control. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement actions with respect to healthcare manufacturers in recent years. We remain committed as a company to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our business. \nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various national, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2024 and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2025.\n6\nMarketing\nOur Proprietary Products customers primarily include many of the major biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world, which incorporate our components and other offerings into their injectable products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate end-user, the patient. Our Contract-Manufactured Products customers include many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies. Contract-Manufactured Products components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly. Our products and services are sold and distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network, with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors. \nOur ten largest customers accounted for 43.4% of our consolidated net sales in 2024, and one of these customers, individually accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales, at 12.3% or $356.4 million, contributing to net sales in both the Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing reporting segments. Please refer to Note 3, \nRevenue\n, and Note 19, \nSegment Information\n, for additional information on our consolidated net sales.\nCompetition\nWith our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with several companies across our Proprietary Products product lines. Competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance, quality, regulatory compliance, and scientific expertise, along with total cost.\nIn addition, there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components, including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices and components. We compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management, as well as our knowledge of, and experience in, compliance with regulatory requirements.\nWe have specialized knowledge of container closure components, which is integral to developing delivery systems. With our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices, including suppliers of prefillable syringes, auto-injectors, safety needles, and other proprietary systems.\nWe seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as a global supplier of integrated drug containment and delivery systems that can provide pre-approval primary packaging support and engineering development, analytical lab services and integrated solutions, regulatory expertise, and after-sale technical support. Customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites.\nOur Contract-Manufactured Products business operates in very competitive markets for its products. The competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global assembly manufacturers. Given the cost pressures they face, many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from low-cost locations. We seek to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and reputation and by employing new technologies such as high-speed automated assembly, insert-molding, multi-shot precision molding, and expertise with multiple-piece closure systems.\nResearch and Development Activities\nWe maintain our own research-scale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development. Our quality control, regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and drug delivery systems. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in primary packaging, drug delivery and administration technologies.\n7\nCommercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years. New products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices, and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period.\nWe continue to pursue strategic initiatives in drug containment components, integrated drug containment systems, novel drug delivery devices, novel therapeutic experiences and administration systems.\nWe also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition, licensing, partnering or development of products, services and technologies.\nHuman Ca\npital\n Management\nOur People\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 10,600 people, excluding contractors and temporary workers, in our operations throughout the world. During 2024\n, West hired approximately 1,800 new team members and experienced an attrition rate of approximately 17%. The following table presents the approximate\n percentage of our employees by region: \nNorth America\n44%\nEurope\n41%\nAsia Pacific\n12%\nSouth America\n3%\nTotal \n100%\nAs of December 31, 2024, the following table presents the approximate percentage of our employees by business unit: \nGlobal Operations\n84%\nCorporate\n6%\nSales and Marketing\n4%\nDigital & Technology (D&T)\n4%\nResearch & Development\n2%\nTotal\n100%\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had the following global gender demographics: \nMen\nWomen\nWest Global Employees\n63%\n37%\n8\nTraining, Compliance and Talent Development\nWe strongly encourage our team members to engage in continuous learning and provide development opportunities to strengthen individual skills and gain new experiences with the goal to build talent from within. We offer resources such as our tuition reimbursement program and our online learning catalog, with more than 46,000 courses available. We centrally manage and organize on-the-job training, instructor-led trainings and online trainings in many different languages and topics through our global Learning Management System.\nOur team members live our values (Passion for Customer, Leadership in Quality and One West Team) as they work together to support our mission to improve patients' lives. West’s Code of Conduct, available in multiple languages on westpharma.com, provides guidance to our team members on appropriate and ethical conduct. Every team member is required to undergo Code of Conduct and mutual respect in the workplace training annually. \nOur focus on talent acquisition, performance management, resource planning and leadership assessment are strongly aligned with our inclusion, collaboration, and innovation strategies, all of which lead to more opportunities, better access to talent and stronger business performance. \nCompensation and Benefits\nWest is committed to providing fair and competitive compensation and benefits programs to attract, retain and reward high-performing team members at all levels. We offer a comprehensive total rewards program to support the health, financial and home-life needs of our team members. Total Rewards at West are defined as the value of the Compensation and Benefits programs offered to employees, which aim to reflect the value of the job and the contribution of the individual, while linking employees’ performance to business and personal results. Based on country of employment, West may provide health care and retirement savings programs as well as paid time off, flexible work schedules, a Global Employee Assistance Program and an Employee Stock Purchase Program. \nHealth, Safety and Wellness \nThe health and safety of our team members has always been both a top priority and a cultural value. West's commitment to the safety of our teams starts at the top and is driven throughout our business by every level of management and by every team member across the globe. West has a Health, Safety, and Environment (\"HSE\") Governance Council consisting of West Leadership Team members and executive operations leaders to monitor and support our HSE process. West’s global HSE team is also a critical component in leading the safety efforts at our sites. Each manufacturing location has dedicated and trained HSE professionals, responsible for general safety oversight and regulatory compliance at the site. Through our SEE-DO-SAY program, we train, empower, and expect our team members to proactively identify and mitigate risk before an incident occurs. Our HSE and employee well-being can also be seen in our focus on quality implementation of proactive Leading Indicator programs and metrics, and team-member-led Hazard Identification programs that help to drive improved Lagging Indicator performance. \n9\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Commitment\nWest has been committed to ESG topics for many years. During 2024, we continued to increase internal and external awareness of our ESG commitment by expanding our education and communication regarding our ESG program and initiatives and more closely integrating ESG considerations into our business processes. Our ESG program includes a senior-level cross-functional ESG team which has been working with executive leadership, our board and other stakeholders to enhance our ESG framework and ensure alignment with our corporate mission, vision and values. Going forward, the ESG program will have an increased focus on compliance, given the increased regulatory requirements, as well as advancing our long-term strategic priorities. Our long-term strategic priorities include focus on talent attraction, retention and engagement; a climate and greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") reduction strategy that incorporates renewable energy and reduced absolute and intensity emissions; developing a more sustainable and responsible supply chain; research and development that focuses on issues of sustainability including secondary packaging, beneficial reuse and recyclability; and, reduction of waste and water in our operational processes. These areas of focus are in addition to our commitments to safety, quality, business continuity, as well as business compliance and integrity. Additionally, our philanthropic programs are an essential element of our corporate citizenship especially as we focus on the areas of children’s health; access to healthcare; and science, technology, engineering and math education. We are also expanding our philanthropic scope to include more sustainability related initiatives. We solicit input from a variety of stakeholders including employees, customers, and suppliers on ways to improve in these and other ESG areas and see continued progress in these areas as critical to maintaining an engaged and responsible workforce.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a website at \nwww.westpharma.com\n.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe following discussion is intended to further the reader’s understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nFor the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic net sales exclude the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures and translate the current-period reported sales of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than USD at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. We may also refer to adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted consolidated operating profit margin, which exclude the effects of unallocated items. The unallocated items are not representative of ongoing operations, and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments, and other specifically-identified income or expense items. The re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation, the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures, and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are incorporated in our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.\nOur Operations\nWe are a leading global manufacturer in the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. Our products include a variety of primary proprietary packaging, containment solutions, reconstitution and transfer systems, and drug delivery systems, as well as contract manufacturing, analytical lab services and integrated solutions. Our customers include leading biologic, generic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies around the world. Our top priority is delivering quality products that meet the exact product specifications and quality standards customers require and expect. This focus on quality includes a commitment to excellence in manufacturing, scientific and technical expertise and management, which enables us to partner with our customers in order to deliver safe, effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently. \nOur business operations are organized into two global segments, Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Our Proprietary Products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging, containment solutions and drug delivery systems, along with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions, primarily to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. We also maintain collaborations to share technologies and market products with affiliates in Japan and Mexico.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nWe have operations based in Israel that conduct research and development activities and manufacture certain components for our devices. Our Israel-based facilities continue to substantially operate as they had prior to the conflict in Israel and surrounding area. We continue to monitor the impact of the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas on our operations and those of our suppliers, the possible expansion of such conflict and potential geopolitical consequences, if any, on our business and operations.\n29\nComponents of and Key Factors Influencing Our Results of Operations\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. We believe the items discussed below provide insight into the factors that affect these key measures.\nNet Sales\nOur net sales result from the sale of goods or services and reflect the net consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nSeveral factors affect our reported net sales in any period, including product, payer and geographic sales mix, operational effectiveness, pricing realization, timing of orders and shipments, regulatory actions, competition, and business acquisitions that involve our customers or competitors.\nCost of goods and services sold and gross profit\nCost of goods and services sold includes personnel costs, manufacturing costs, raw materials and product costs, freight costs, depreciation, and facility costs associated with our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. Fluctuations in our cost of goods sold correspond with the fluctuations in sales units as well as inflationary and other market factors that influence our cost base.\nGross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of goods and services sold. Our gross profit is affected by product and geographic sales mix, realized pricing of our products, the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the costs of materials used to make our products. \nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses relate to our investments in improvements to our manufacturing processes, product enhancements, and additional investments in our elastomeric packaging components, formulation development, integrated drug containment systems, self-injection systems and drug administration consumables.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period primarily based on the ongoing improvements to our manufacturing processes and product enhancements. \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs, incentive compensation, insurance, professional fees, and depreciation. \n30\nFinancial Performance Summary\nThe following tables present a reconciliation from U.S. GAAP to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures: \n($ in millions)\nOperating profit\nIncome tax expense\nNet income\nDiluted EPS\nYear ended December 31, 2024 GAAP\n$\n569.9 \n$\n107.5 \n$\n492.7 \n$\n6.69 \nUnallocated items:\nRestructuring and other charges\n (1)\n2.1 \n0.4 \n1.7 \n0.02 \nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets \n(2)\n0.8 \n0.1 \n2.8 \n0.04 \nYear ended December 31, 2024 adjusted amounts (non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n572.8 \n$\n108.0 \n$\n497.2 \n$\n6.75 \nDuring 2024, we recorded a tax benefit of $19.5 million associated with stock-based compensation. \n($ in millions)\nOperating profit\nIncome tax expense\nNet income\nDiluted EPS\nYear ended December 31, 2023 GAAP\n$\n676.0 \n$\n122.3 \n$\n593.4 \n$\n7.88 \nUnallocated items:\nRestructuring and other charges\n (1)\n(2.0)\n(0.9)\n(1.1)\n(0.02)\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets \n(2)\n0.7 \n0.1 \n2.8 \n0.04 \nLoss on disposal of plant \n(3)\n11.6 \n(0.7)\n12.3 \n0.16 \nCost investment activity \n(4)\n4.3 \n— \n4.3 \n0.06 \nLegal settlement \n(5)\n— \n(0.9)\n(2.9)\n(0.04)\nYear ended December 31, 2023 adjusted amounts (non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n690.6 \n$\n119.9 \n$\n608.8 \n$\n8.08 \nDuring 2023, we recorded a tax benefit of $32.0 million associated with stock-based compensation. \n($ in millions)\nOperating profit\nIncome tax expense\nNet income\nDiluted EPS\nYear ended December 31, 2022 GAAP\n$\n734.0 \n$\n114.7 \n$\n585.9 \n$\n7.73 \nUnallocated items:\nRestructuring and other charges\n (1)\n23.8 \n2.0 \n21.8 \n0.29 \nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets \n(2)\n0.7 \n0.1 \n2.8 \n0.04 \nCost investment activity \n(4)\n3.5 \n— \n3.5 \n0.05 \nPension settlement \n(6)\n— \n20.6 \n31.6 \n0.42 \nRoyalty acceleration \n(7)\n— \n1.3 \n(1.3)\n(0.02)\nTax law changes \n(8)\n— \n(5.7)\n5.7 \n0.07 \nYear ended December 31, 2022 adjusted amounts (non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n762.0 \n$\n133.0 \n$\n650.0 \n$\n8.58 \nDuring 2022, we recorded a tax benefit of $16.5 million associated with stock-based compensation.\n31\n(1)\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded expense to restructuring and other charges of $2.1 million. The net expense represents the impact of two items, the first of which is $4.6 million of expense recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in connection with a plan to optimize the legal structure of the Company and its subsidiaries. The expense consists primarily of consulting fees, legal expenses, and other one-time costs directly attributable to this plan. This expense was partially offset by a $2.5 million benefit recorded within other expense (income) related to revised severance estimates in connection with the Company's 2022 restructuring plan. During 2023, the Company recorded a benefit to restructuring and other charges of $2.0 million, which represents the net impact of a $2.8 million\n b\nenefit within other expense (income) for revised severance estimates in connection with its 2022 restructuring plan and an inventory write down of $0.8 million within cost of goods and services sold. During 2022, the Company recorded expense to restructuring and other charges of $23.8 million, which primarily included a charge of $8.7 million in net severance and post-employment benefits primarily in connection with our plan to adjust our operating cost base and $15.3 million in asset-related charges associated with this plan.\n(2)\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $0.8 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of amortization expense within operating profit associated with an acquisition of an intangible asset during the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, during 2024, 2023 and 2022, the company recorded $2.1 million of amortization expense in association with an acquisition of increased ownership interest in Daikyo.\n(3)\nDuring \n2023\n, \nthe Company recorded expense of $11.6 million as a result of the sale of one of the Company’s manufacturing facilities within the Proprietary Products segment. The transaction closed during the second quarter of 2023.\n(4)\nDuring 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded cost investment impairment charges of $4.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\n(5)\nDuring \n2023\n, the Company recorded a benefit of $3.8 million \nwithin other nonoperating expense (income) \nas a result of a favorable legal settlement related to a matter not included in our normal operations.\n(6)\nDuring 2022, we recorded a gross pension settlement charge of $52.2 million within other nonoperating expense (income), which primarily relates to the full settlement of the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan (the \"U.S. pension plan\"). \nPlease refer to Note 15, \nBenefit Plans\n,\n for further discussion of these items.\n(7)\nDuring 2022, the Company increased its expected tax benefit related to the prepayment of future royalties from one of its subsidiaries by $1.3 million\n. \n(8)\nDuring 2022, the Company incurred additional tax expense of $5.7 million due to the impact of a tax law change in the state of Pennsylvania enacted during the period. \n32\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe evaluate the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments.

Such items are referred to as other unallocated items for which further information can be found above in the reconciliation from U.S. GAAP to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Discussion of the year-over-year changes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and the results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 is included in Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations \nof our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024, and is incorporated herein by reference. \nPercentages in the following tables and throughout this \nResults of Operations\n section may reflect rounding adjustments.\nNet Sales\nThe following table presents net sales, consolidated and by reportable segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Change\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\nProprietary Products\n$\n2,334.5 \n$\n2,397.3 \n$\n2,406.8 \n(2.6 \n%)\n(0.4 \n%)\nContract-Manufactured Products\n558.7 \n552.5 \n480.4 \n1.1 \n%\n15.0 \n%\nIntersegment sales elimination\n— \n— \n(0.3)\n— \n%\n(100.0 \n%)\nConsolidated net sales\n$\n2,893.2 \n$\n2,949.8 \n$\n2,886.9 \n(1.9 \n%)\n2.2 \n%\nConsolidated net sales decreased by $56.6 million, or 1.9%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $7.0 million. Excluding foreign currency translation effects and the impact related to the disposal of one of our plants of $4.3 million, consolidated net sales decreased by $45.3 million, or 1.5%.\nProprietary Products – \nProprietary Products net sales decreased by $62.8 million, or 2.6%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $6.9 million. Excluding foreign currency translation effects and the impact related to the disposal of one of our plants of $4.3 million, net sales decreased by $51.6 million, or 2.2%, due to a decline in sales of certain High-Value Product (\"HVP\") offerings due to customer inventory management, primarily FluroTec® products, Westar® components and Daikyo® components. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in sales of self-injection device platforms and increased sales prices, which includes approximately $47 million in customer incentives earned in connection with volumes achieved during 2024, as compared to 2023.\nContract-Manufactured Products –\n Contract-Manufactured Products net sales increased by $6.2 million, or 1.1%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $0.1 million. Excluding foreign currency translation effects, net sales increased by $6.3 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in sales of self-injection devices for obesity and diabetes and sales price increases, offset by a decrease in sales of healthcare diagnostic devices.\nThe intersegment sales elimination, which is required for the presentation of consolidated net sales, represents the elimination of components sold between our segments.\n33\nGross Profit\nThe following table presents gross profit and related gross margins, consolidated and by reportable segment and by unallocated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Change\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\nProprietary Products:\n \n \n \n \n \nGross profit\n$\n900.5 \n$\n1,034.0 \n$\n1,053.3 \n(12.9 \n%)\n(1.8 \n%)\nGross profit margin\n38.6 \n%\n43.1 \n%\n43.8 \n%\nContract-Manufactured Products:\n \n \nGross profit\n$\n98.0 \n$\n96.0 \n$\n82.9 \n2.1 \n%\n15.8 \n%\nGross profit margin\n17.5 \n%\n17.4 \n%\n17.3 \n%\nUnallocated items\n$\n— \n$\n(0.8)\n$\n— \nConsolidated gross profit\n$\n998.5 \n$\n1,129.2 \n$\n1,136.2 \n(11.6 \n%)\n(0.6 \n%)\nConsolidated gross profit margin\n34.5 \n%\n38.3 \n%\n39.4 \n%\nConsolidated gross profit decreased by $130.7 million, or 11.6%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $2.1 million. Consolidated gross profit margin decreased by 3.8 margin points in 2024.\nProprietary Products –\n Proprietary Products gross profit decreased by $133.5 million, or 12.9%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $2.1 million. Proprietary Products gross profit margin decreased by 4.5 margin points in 2024. The decrease is driven by lower plant absorption from reduced customer demand and an unfavorable shift in mix of products sold from HVP Components to HVP Delivery Devices. These headwinds were partially offset by increased sales prices and approximately $47 million in customer incentives earned in connection with volumes achieved during 2024, as compared to 2023.\nContract-Manufactured Products – \nContract-Manufactured Products gross profit increased by $2.0 million, or 2.1%, in 2024. Contract-Manufactured Products gross profit margin increased by 0.1 margin points in 2024, primarily due to increased sales prices.\nResearch and Development (“R&D”) Costs\nThe following table presents consolidated R&D costs:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Change\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\nConsolidated R&D costs\n$\n69.1 \n$\n68.4 \n$\n58.5 \n1.0 \n%\n16.9 \n%\nConsolidated R&D costs increased by $0.7 million, or 1.0%, in 2024, as compared to 2023, due to increased depreciation as a result of recent investments and increased salary and wages, offset by lower annual incentive compensation. Efforts remain focused on the continued investment in elastomeric packaging components, formulation development, drug containment systems, self-injection systems and drug administration consumable.\nAll of the R&D costs incurred during 2024, 2023 and 2022 related to Proprietary Products.\n34\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Costs\nThe following table presents SG&A costs, consolidated and by reportable segment and corporate and unallocated items:\nYear Ended December 31, \n% Change\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\nProprietary Products\n$\n231.5 \n$\n240.6 \n$\n212.6 \n(3.8 \n%)\n13.2 \n%\nContract-Manufactured Products\n26.2 \n24.4 \n20.9 \n7.4 \n%\n16.7 \n%\nCorporate and unallocated items\n80.8 \n88.4 \n83.4 \n(8.6 \n%)\n6.0 \n%\nConsolidated SG&A costs\n$\n338.5 \n$\n353.4 \n$\n316.9 \n(4.2 \n%)\n11.5 \n%\nSG&A as a % of net sales\n11.7 \n%\n12.0 \n%\n11.0 \n%\nConsolidated SG&A costs decreased by $14.9 million, or 4.2%, in 2024, including a favorable foreign currency translation impact of $0.5 million, primarily due to lower annual incentive compensation and a decrease in expense related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by increased salary and wages.\nProprietary Products – \nProprietary Products SG&A costs decreased by $9.1 million, or 3.8%, in 2024, \nincluding a favorable foreign currency translation impact of \n$0.5 million. Proprietary Products SG&A costs decreased \nprimarily \ndue to lower annual incentive compensation, partially offset by increased salary and wages.\nContract-Manufactured Products – \nContract-Manufactured Products SG&A costs increased by $1.8 million, or 7.4%, in 2024, primarily due to increased salary and wages.\nCorporate and unallocated items – \nCorporate SG&A costs decreased by $7.6 million, or 8.6%, in 2024, due primarily to a decrease in expense related to stock-based compensation, lower annual incentive compensation and decreased fees related to professional services, partially offset by increased salary and wages.\nOther Expense (Income)\nThe following table presents other expense and income items, consolidated and by reportable segment and corporate and unallocated items:\nYear Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nProprietary Products\n$\n22.1 \n$\n14.9 \n$\n(2.2)\nContract-Manufactured Products\n(0.5)\n(0.5)\n1.6 \nCorporate and unallocated items\n(0.6)\n17.0 \n27.4 \nConsolidated other expense (income)\n$\n21.0 \n$\n31.4 \n$\n26.8 \nOther expense and income items consist of a loss on disposal of plant, asset impairments, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, contingent consideration and miscellaneous income and charges.\nConsolidated other expense (income) changed by $10.4 million in 2024 as compared to \n2023, due to the factors described below.\nProprietary Products\n – Proprietary Products other expense (income) changed by $7.2 million in 2024 \nas compared to 2023\n, primarily due to increased losses on foreign exchange transactions and increased expense related to contingent consideration being recorded in 2024, as compared to 2023. \nContract-Manufactured Products\n – Contract-Manufactured Products other expense (income) remained consistent in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n35\nCorporate and unallocated items\n – Corporate and unallocated items changed by $17.6 million in 2024 as compared to 2023. This is primarily due to the Company recording expense of $11.6 million as a result of the sale of one of the Company’s manufacturing facilities within the Proprietary Products segment during 2023, which was not repeated in 2024. Additionally, the Company recorded additional asset impairments related to our cost method investments in 2023, as compared to 2024.\nOperating Profit\nThe following table presents operating profit and adjusted operating profit, consolidated and by reportable segment, corporate and unallocated items:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Change\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\nProprietary Products\n$\n577.8 \n$\n710.1 \n$\n784.4 \n(18.6 \n%)\n(9.5 \n%)\nContract-Manufactured Products\n72.3 \n72.1 \n60.4 \n0.3 \n%\n19.4 \n%\nCorporate and unallocated\n(80.2)\n(106.2)\n(110.8)\n(24.5 \n%)\n(4.2 \n%)\nConsolidated operating profit\n$\n569.9 \n$\n676.0 \n$\n734.0 \n(15.7 \n%)\n(7.9 \n%)\nConsolidated operating profit margin\n19.7 \n%\n22.9 \n%\n25.4 \n%\nUnallocated items\n2.9 \n14.6 \n28.0 \nAdjusted consolidated operating profit\n$\n572.8 \n$\n690.6 \n$\n762.0 \n(17.1 \n%)\n(9.4 \n%)\nAdjusted consolidated operating profit margin\n19.8 \n%\n23.4 \n%\n26.4 \n%\nConsolidated operating profit decreased by $106.1 million, or 15.7%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $1.6 million, due to the factors described above.\nProprietary Products –\n Proprietary Products operating profit decreased by $132.3 million, or 18.6%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $1.6 million, due to the factors described above, most notably lower gross profit driven by lower sales volume and an unfavorable mix of products sold.\nContract-Manufactured Products –\n Contract-Manufactured Products operating profit increased by $0.2 million, or 0.3%, in 2024, due to the factors described above, most notably the increased sales prices.\nCorporate and unallocated –\n Excluding the unallocated items, Corporate costs decreased by $14.3 million, or 15.6%, in 2024, due to the factors described above, most notably the decrease in expense related to stock-based compensation and lower annual incentive compensation.\nFor unallocated items, please refer to the Financial Performance Summary section above for details.\nInterest Expense, Net and Interest Income\nThe following table presents interest expense, net, by significant component:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Change\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\nInterest expense\n$\n16.2 \n$\n14.8 \n$\n11.6 \n9.5 \n%\n27.6 \n%\nCapitalized interest\n(13.2)\n(5.8)\n(3.7)\n127.6 \n%\n56.8 \n%\nInterest expense, net\n$\n3.0 \n$\n9.0 \n$\n7.9 \n(66.7)\n%\n13.9 \n%\nInterest income\n$\n(19.6)\n$\n(28.0)\n$\n(5.1)\n(30.0)\n%\n449.0 \n%\n36\nInterest expense, net, decreased by $6.0 million, or 66.7%, in 2024, primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest.\nInterest income decreased by $8.4 million in 2024, due primarily to the Company having a lower average cash balance during 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023.\nOther Nonoperating Expense (Income)\nOther nonoperating expense (income) was $1.0 million, $(3.0) million and $51.3 million for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Other nonoperating expense (income) changed by $4.0 million in 2024, primarily due to a benefit from a favorable legal settlement recorded in 2023 that was not repeated in 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $107.5 million, $122.3 million, and $114.7 million for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 18.4%, 17.5%, and 16.9%, respectively.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate in 2024 of 0.9% is primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation in 2024, as compared to 2023, partially offset by a decrease in our tax liability on unremitted earnings of our Germany subsidiaries due to a tax law change in 2024.\nPlease refer to Note 17, \nIncome Taxes\n, for further discussion of our income taxes.\nEquity in Net Income of Affiliated Companies\nEquity in net income of affiliated companies was $14.7 million, $17.7 million, and $20.7 million for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by $3.0 million, or 16.9%, in 2024, primarily due to less favorable operating results at Daikyo.\n37\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents cash flow data for the years ended December 31:\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n653.4 \n$\n776.5 \n$\n724.0 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(378.7)\n$\n(368.7)\n$\n(288.2)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(622.6)\n$\n(459.6)\n$\n(293.6)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities \nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $123.1 million in 2024, primarily due to a decline in operating results.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\n \nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $10.0 million in 2024, due to an increase in capital expenditures for additional manufacturing capacity to meet future customer demand.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities \nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $163.0 million in 2024, primarily due to increases in purchases under our share repurchase program, increased principal repayments on finance leases and decreased proceeds from stock-based compensation awards in 2024, as compared to 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of:\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n484.6 \n$\n853.9 \nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n552.5 \n$\n512.0 \nInventories\n$\n377.0 \n$\n434.7 \nAccounts payable\n$\n239.3 \n$\n242.4 \nDebt\n$\n202.6 \n$\n206.8 \nEquity\n$\n2,682.3 \n$\n2,881.0 \nWorking capital\n$\n987.7 \n$\n1,264.6 \nCash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.\nCash and cash equivalents –\n Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2024 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments. The cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2024 included $94.4 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the U.S. and $390.2 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the U.S. For further information on our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits refer to Note 17, \nIncome Taxes\n.\n38\nWorking capital -\n Working capital at December 31, 2024 decreased by $276.9 million, or 21.9%, as compared to December 31, 2023, which includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $41.8 million. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents, total current liabilities and inventories decreased by $349.0 million, $103.3 million and $42.0 million, respectively, \nwhile \naccounts receivable\n increased by \n$58.8 million. \nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to capital expenditures and share repurchases in \n2024\n, offset by cash collections driven by positive operating results during the period. \nThe decrease in total current liabilities was primarily due to the Company amending its Credit Facility Agreement during 2024. As part of this amendment, all current notes payable and other current debt amounts were repaid.\n The decrease in inventories and the increase in accounts receivable were both due to increased net sales leading up to the \nDecember 31, 2024\n balance sheet date as compared to the \nDecember 31, 2023\n balance sheet date.\nDebt and credit facilities -\n The $4.2 million decrease in total debt at December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, is due to the net activity of debt repayments and borrowings as mentioned in Note 10,\n \nDebt\n.\nOur sources of liquidity include our multi-currency revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2024, the borrowing capacity available under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, including outstanding letters of credit of $2.4 million, was $497.6 million. We do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. Please refer to Note 10,\n \nDebt\n, for further discussion of our multi-currency revolving credit facility.\nPursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2025. \nWe believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nContractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities are expected to result in cash payments in future periods, and include the following material items: \n•\nOur business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers, including for the purchase of raw materials \nand finished goods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, our outstanding unconditional contractual commitments, including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods, amounted to $200.7 million, of which $46.7 million is due to be paid in 2025. These purchase commitments are in the normal course of business. The Company previously entered into a material supply agreement for butyl polymers used as a principal raw material in a broad range of the Company’s polymer-based pharmaceutical packaging products.\n•\nOur long-term debt obligations, net of unamortized debt issuance costs including fixed and variable-rate debt, is further discussed in Note 10, \nDebt\n.\n•\nOur lease obligations primarily related to land, buildings, and machinery and equipment, with lease terms through 2269 further discussed in Note 6, \nLeases\n.\n•\nOur various tax-qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan obligations in the U.S. and other countries that cover employees and former employees who meet eligibility requirements is further discussed in Note 15, \nBenefit Plans\n.\n39\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position: \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets: \nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and finance lease right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances, such as a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions or a change in company strategy, increased competition, declining product demand, plans to dispose of an asset or asset group, or recent financial or legal factors that could impact the expected cash flows, indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. Impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, selection of appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The Company uses estimates that are consistent with its business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. Once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other expense (income) for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value. For assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. For assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\n Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. A goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test, such as future sales, future cash flows and long-term growth rates, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. Amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products, as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems. Changes in the estimate of fair value, including the estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. Accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, based upon our qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount, then it would not be necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test. Based upon our assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test in the current year.\nValuing identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. For example, for recent identifiable customer relationship intangible asset acquisitions, we applied an excess earnings model, which is a form of the income approach. This approach includes projecting revenues and expenses attributable to the existing customers over the remaining economic life of the customer relationships and then subtracting the required return on net tangible assets and any intangible assets used in the business to estimate any residual excess earnings attributable to the customer relationships. The after-tax excess earnings are then discounted to present value using the respective discount rates. \n40\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: 1) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; 2) significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business; 3) significant negative industry or economic trends; and 4) recognition of goodwill impairment charges. If we determine that the carrying value of identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying value of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from such assets. If such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, we measure an impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair values of the assets.\nIncome Taxes:\n We estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. In addition, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities. The enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income, generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level. Changes in tax legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined.\nWhen accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements, we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nPlease refer to Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our significant accounting policies. \n41",
