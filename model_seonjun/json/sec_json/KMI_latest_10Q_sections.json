See Note 2. “Acquisitions and Divestiture” to our consolidated financial statements for further information on this transaction.\nEvent\nDescription\nBusiness Segment\nOutrigger Energy acquisition\n$648 million\n(February 2025)\nNatural gas gathering and processing system in North Dakota from Outrigger Energy II LLC which includes a 0.27 Bcf/d processing facility and a 104-mile, large-diameter, high-pressure rich gas gathering header pipeline with 0.35 Bcf/d of capacity connecting supplies from the Williston Basin area to high-demand markets.\nNatural Gas Pipelines\n(Midstream)\n2025 Dividends and Discretionary Capital\nWe expect to declare dividends of $1.17 per share for 2025, a 2% increase from the 2024 declared dividends of $1.15 per share. W\ne expect to invest $3.0 billion in e\nxpansion projects, acquisitions, and contributions to joint ventures during 2025.\nThe expectations for 2025 discussed above involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance. Many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict, and because of these uncertainties, it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs described in further detail below, our management evaluates our performance primarily using Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. an\nd Segment earnings before DD&A expenses (EBDA) (as presente\nd in Note 7 “Reportable Segments”), along with the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock, \nin\n the aggregate and per share, Adjusted Segment EBDA, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, DD&A expenses and amortization of basis differences related to our joint ventures (previously known as amortization of excess cost of equity investments) (EBITDA), and Net Debt.\nEffective January 1, 2025, amortization of basis differences related to our joint ventures (previously known as amortization of excess cost of equity investments) is included within “Earnings from equity investments” in our accompanying consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and therefore is included within Segment EBDA. As a result, Segment EBDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation in the following MD&A tables. The adjustments were not material. \nGAAP Financial Measures\nOur Consolidated Earnings Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 present Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., as prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and Segment EBDA, which is disclosed in Note 7 “Reportable Segments” pursuant to FASB ASC 280. The composition of Segment EBDA is not addressed nor prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles. Segment EBDA is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before DD&A and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers, such as general and administrative expenses and corporate charges, interest expense, net, and income taxes. Our general and administrative expenses and corporate charges include such items as \n32\nunallocated employee benefits, insurance, rentals, unallocated litigation and environmental expenses, and shared corporate services including accounting, information technology, human resources, and legal services.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur non-GAAP financial measures described below should not be considered alternatives to GAAP Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. or other GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. You should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures by reviewing our comparable GAAP measures identified in the descriptions of consolidated non-GAAP measures below, understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision-making processes.\nCertain Items\nCertain Items, as adjustments used to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures, are items that are required by GAAP to be reflected in Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., but typically either (i) do not have a cash impact (for example, unsettled commodity hedges and asset impairments), or (ii) by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in most cases are likely to occur only sporadically (for example, certain legal settlements, enactment of new tax legislation, and casualty losses). (See the tables included in “\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.,\n” “\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock,\n” \nand \n“\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA\n”\n \nbelow). We also include adjustments related to joint ventures (see “\n—\nAmounts associated with Joint Ventures” below). The following table summarizes our Certain Items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, which are also described in more detail in the footnotes to tables included in “\n—Segment Earnings Results\n” below.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nCertain Items\nChange in fair value of derivative contracts(a)\n$\n24 \n$\n(20)\n$\n13 \n$\n32 \nGain on divestitures(b)\n— \n— \n— \n(70)\nIncome tax Certain Items(c)\n(4)\n(49)\n(41)\n(48)\nOther\n— \n1 \n1 \n3 \nTotal Certain Items(d)(e)\n$\n20 \n$\n(68)\n$\n(27)\n$\n(83)\n(a)\nGains or losses are reflected within non-GAAP financial measures when realized. \n(b)\n2024 amount for the nine-month period includes a gain of $41 million on the divestiture of CO\n2\n assets and a gain of $29 million on the divestiture of Oklahoma midstream assets.\n(c)\nRepresents the income tax provision on Certain Items plus discrete income tax items. Includes the impact of KMI’s income tax provision on Certain Items affecting earnings from equity investments and is separate from the related tax provision recognized at the \ninvestees by the joint ventures which are also taxable entities.\n(d)\n2025 amounts for the three and nine-month periods each include the $(1) million report\ned within “Earnings from equity investments” on the accompanying consolidated statement of income of “Change in fair value of derivative contracts.”\n(e)\nAmounts for the periods ending September 30, 2025 and 2024 inclu\nde $11 million and $4 million, respectively, for the three-month periods and $12 million and $5 million for the\n nine-month periods, respectively, reported within “Interest, net” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income of “Change in fair value of derivative contracts.”\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. is calculated by adjusting Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. for Certain Items. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. is used by us, investors, and other external users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure that provides decision-useful information regarding our period-over-period performance and ability to generate earnings that are core to our ongoing operations. We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. is Net income attributable to \n33\nKinder Morgan, Inc. See \n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.” \nbelow.\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock and Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock is calculated by adjusting Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., the most comparable GAAP measure, for Certain Items, and further for net income allocated to participating securities and adjusted net income in excess of distributions for participating securities\n. We believe Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock allows for calculation of adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) on the most comparable basis with earnings per share, the most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EPS. Adjusted EPS is calculat\ned as Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock divided by our weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS applies the same two-class method used in arriving at basic earnings per share. Adjusted EPS is used by us, investors, and other external users of our financial statements as a per-share supplemental measure that provides decision-useful information regarding our period-over-period performance and ability to generate earnings that are core to our ongoing operations. See \n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock” \nbelow.\nAdjusted Segment EBDA\nAdjusted Segment EBDA is calculated by adjusting segment earnings before DD&A, general and administrative expenses and corporate charges, interest expense, and income taxes (Segment EBDA) for Certain Items attributable to the segment. Adjusted Segment EBDA is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business. We believe Adjusted Segment EBDA is a useful performance metric because it provides management, investors, and other external users of our financial statements additional insight into performance trends across our business segments, our segments’ relative contributions to our consolidated performance, and the ability of our segments to generate earnings on an ongoing basis. Adjusted Segment EBDA is also used as a factor in determining compensation under our annual incentive compensation program for our business segment presidents and other business segment employees. We believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance. See “\n—Segment Earnings Results\n”\n \nbelow.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. for Certain Items and further for DD&A, amortization of basis differences related to our joint ventures, income tax expense, and interest. We also include amounts from joint ventures for income taxes and DD&A (see “\n—\nAmounts associated with Joint Ventures” below). Adjusted EBITDA is used by management, investors, and other external users, in conjunction with our Net Debt (as described further below), to evaluate our leverage. Management and external users also use Adjusted EBITDA as an important metric to compare the valuations of companies across our industry. Our ratio of Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental performance target for purposes of our annual incentive compensation program. We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. See “\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA\n”\n \nbelow\n.\nAmounts associated with Joint Ventures\nCertain Items and Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts from unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures utilizing the same recognition and measurement methods used to record “Earnings from equity investments” and “Noncontrolling interests,” respectively. The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA related to our unconsolidated and consolidated joint ventures include DD&A, amortization of basis differences, and income tax expense with respect to the joint ventures as those included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries; further, we remove the portion of these adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests. (See “\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA\n”\n \nbelow.) Although these amounts related to our unconsolidated joint ventures are included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues, expenses, or cash flows of such unconsolidated joint ventures.\nNet Debt\nNet Debt is calculated, based on amounts as of September 30, 2025, by subtracting the following amounts from our debt balance of $\n32,580 \nmillion: (i) cash and cash equivalents of $71 million; (ii) debt fair value adjustments of $196 million; and \n34\n(iii) the foreign exchange impact on Euro-denominated bonds of $44 million f\nor \nwhich we have entered into currency swaps to convert that debt to U.S. dollars. Net \nDebt, on its own and in conjunction with our Adjusted EBITDA as part of a ratio of Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management, investors, and other external users of our financial information to evaluate our leverage. Our ratio of Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental performance target for purposes of our annual incentive compensation program. We believe the most comparable measure to Net Debt is total debt.\nConsolidated Earnings Results\nThe following tables summarize the key components of our consolidated earnings results.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\nEarnings\nincrease/(decrease)\n(In millions, except percentages)\nRevenues\n$\n4,146 \n$\n3,699 \n$\n447 \n12 \n%\nOperating Costs, Expenses and Other\nCosts of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n(1,395)\n(1,024)\n(371)\n(36)\n%\nOperations and maintenance\n(786)\n(790)\n4 \n1 \n%\nDD&A\n(609)\n(587)\n(22)\n(4)\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n(183)\n(176)\n(7)\n(4)\n%\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n(111)\n(107)\n(4)\n(4)\n%\nOther income, net\n1 \n— \n1 \n— \n%\nTotal Operating Costs, Expenses and Other\n(3,083)\n(2,684)\n(399)\n(15)\n%\nOperating Income\n1,063 \n1,015 \n48 \n5 \n%\nOther Income (Expense)\nEarnings from equity investments\n221 \n199 \n22 \n11 \n%\nInterest, net\n(456)\n(466)\n10 \n2 \n%\nOther, net\n11 \n16 \n(5)\n(31)\n%\nTotal Other Expense\n(224)\n(251)\n27 \n11 \n%\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n839 \n764 \n75 \n10 \n%\nIncome Tax Expense\n(185)\n(113)\n(72)\n(64)\n%\nNet Income\n654 \n651 \n3 \n— \n%\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n(26)\n(26)\n— \n— \n%\nNet Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\n$\n628 \n$\n625 \n$\n3 \n— \n%\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\n$\n0.28 \n$\n0.28 \n$\n— \n— \n%\nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding \n2,224 \n2,221 \n3 \n— \n%\nDeclared dividends per share\n$\n0.2925 \n$\n0.2875 \n$\n0.005 \n2 \n%\n35\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\nEarnings\nincrease/(decrease)\n(In millions, except percentages)\nRevenues\n$\n12,429 \n$\n11,113 \n$\n1,316 \n12 \n%\nOperating Costs, Expenses and Other\nCosts of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n(4,082)\n(3,098)\n(984)\n(32)\n%\nOperations and maintenance\n(2,270)\n(2,211)\n(59)\n(3)\n%\nDD&A\n(1,835)\n(1,758)\n(77)\n(4)\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n(558)\n(530)\n(28)\n(5)\n%\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n(334)\n(327)\n(7)\n(2)\n%\nOther income, net\n10 \n87 \n(77)\n(89)\n%\nTotal Operating Costs, Expenses and Other\n(9,069)\n(7,837)\n(1,232)\n(16)\n%\nOperating Income\n3,360 \n3,276 \n84 \n3 \n%\nOther Income (Expense)\nEarnings from equity investments\n647 \n625 \n22 \n4 \n%\nInterest, net\n(1,359)\n(1,402)\n43 \n3 \n%\nOther, net\n39 \n17 \n22 \n129 \n%\nTotal Other Expense\n(673)\n(760)\n87 \n11 \n%\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n2,687 \n2,516 \n171 \n7 \n%\nIncome Tax Expense\n(548)\n(490)\n(58)\n(12)\n%\nNet Income\n2,139 \n2,026 \n113 \n6 \n%\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n(79)\n(80)\n1 \n1 \n%\nNet Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\n$\n2,060 \n$\n1,946 \n$\n114 \n6 \n%\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\n$\n0.92 \n$\n0.87 \n$\n0.05 \n6 \n%\nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding \n2,223 \n2,220 \n3 \n— \n%\nDeclared dividends per share\n$\n0.8775 \n$\n0.8625 \n$\n0.015 \n2 \n%\nOur consolidated revenues primarily consist of services and sales revenue. Our services revenues include fees for transportation and other midstream services that we perform. Fluctuations in our consolidated services revenue largely reflect changes in volumes and/or in the rates we charge. Our consolidated sales revenues include sales of natural gas (includes natural gas and RNG), products (includes NGL, crude oil, CO\n2\n, and transmix), and other (includes RINs). Our consolidated sales revenue will fluctuate with commodity prices and volumes, and the costs of sales associated with purchases will usually have a commensurate and offsetting impact, except for the CO\n2\n segment, which produces, instead of purchases, the crude oil, CO\n2\n, and RINs it sells. Additionally, fluctuations in revenues and costs of sales may be further impacted by gains or losses from derivative contracts that we use to manage our commodity price risk.\nBelow is a discussion of significant changes in our Consolidated Earnings Results for the comparable three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nRevenues\nRevenues increased \n$447 million\n and \n$1,316 million\n for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year periods.\nThe increases were primarily due to (i) increases in natural gas sales of \n$392 million \nand $1,173 million, respectively, due to higher natural gas commodity prices and volumes; (ii) increases in services revenues of \n$112 million\n and $341 million, respectively\n, resulting from higher volumes, primarily driven by increased demand for services and expansion projects placed into service, higher rates, and the Outrigger Energy assets acquired in February 2025; an\nd (iii) an increase in other sales for the nine-month period of $20 million driven by higher RIN sales. Revenues were further increased by $26 million in the nine-month period for the impacts of derivative contracts used to hedge commodity sales. These increases in revenues were partially \n36\noffset by lower product sales of \n$65 million\n and $254 million, respectively, driven primarily by lowe\nr prices partially offset by higher volumes and in the nine-month period, by asset divestitures in 2024 partially offset by assets acquired in 2024. The increase in sales revenues had corresponding increases in our costs of sales as described below under “\nOperati\nng Costs, Expenses and Other—Costs of sales\n.”\nOperating Costs, Expenses and Other\nCosts of sales\nCosts of sales increased \n$371 million\n and $984 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year periods. The increases, which are net of the impact of our divested assets for the nine-month period, were primarily due to higher costs of sales for natural gas of $403 million and $1,112 million, respectively, primarily due to higher commodity prices and volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower costs of sales for products of \n$48 million\n and \n$153 million\n, respectively, driven by lower commodity prices partially offset by higher volumes.\nOperations and Maintenance\nOperations and maintenance\n decreased \n$4 million\n and increased \n$59 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year periods\n.\n The nine-month period increase was primarily driven by greater activity levels, including from expansions, and inflation, including labor costs. \nOther Income, net\nOther income, net increased \n$1 million\n and decreased \n$77 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year periods. The nine-month period decrease was primarily the result of gains on the divestitures of CO\n2\n assets and of Oklahoma midstream assets in 2024.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest, net\nIn the table above, we report our interest expense as “net,” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount. Interest, ne\nt decreased $10 million and $43 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the respective prior year periods. The decreases were primarily due to lower interest rates associated with our fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements partially offset by higher interest rates on our long-term debt, and in the nine-month period, higher average total debt balances.\n37\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliations from Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\n$\n628 \n$\n625 \n$\n2,060 \n$\n1,946 \nCertain Items(a)\nChange in fair value of derivative contracts\n24 \n(20)\n13 \n32 \nGain on divestitures\n— \n— \n— \n(70)\nIncome tax Certain Items\n(4)\n(49)\n(41)\n(48)\nOther\n— \n1 \n1 \n3 \nTotal Certain Items\n20 \n(68)\n(27)\n(83)\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\n$\n648 \n$\n557 \n$\n2,033 \n$\n1,863 \nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock\nNet income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\n$\n628 \n$\n625 \n$\n2,060 \n$\n1,946 \nTotal Certain Items(b)\n20 \n(68)\n(27)\n(83)\nNet income allocated to participating securities and other(c)\n(4)\n(4)\n(11)\n(10)\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock\n$\n644 \n$\n553 \n$\n2,022 \n$\n1,853 \nAdjusted EPS\n$\n0.29 \n$\n0.25 \n$\n0.91 \n$\n0.83 \nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. \n$\n628 \n$\n625 \n$\n2,060 \n$\n1,946 \nTotal Certain Items(b)\n20 \n(68)\n(27)\n(83)\nDD&A\n609 \n587 \n1,835 \n1,758 \nIncome tax expense(d)\n189 \n162 \n589 \n538 \nInterest, net(e)\n445 \n462 \n1,347 \n1,397 \nAmounts associated with joint ventures\nUnconsolidated joint venture DD&A(f)\n96 \n111 \n296 \n308 \nRemove consolidated joint venture partners’ DD&A\n(16)\n(16)\n(47)\n(47)\nUnconsolidated joint venture income tax expense(g)\n20 \n17 \n67 \n58 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,991 \n$\n1,880 \n$\n6,120 \n$\n5,875 \n(a)\nSee table included in “\n—Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—\nCertain Items” above.\n(b)\nSee “\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.\n” for a detailed listing.\n(c)\nOther includes Adjusted net income in excess of distributions for participating securities of $1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n(d)\nTo avoid duplication, adjustments for income tax expense for the periods\n ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 exclude $(4) million and $(49) million for the three-month periods, respectively, and $(41) million and $(48) million for the nine-month periods, respect\nively, which amounts are already included within “Certain Items.” See table included in “\n—Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measu\nres—\nCertain Items” above.\n(e)\nTo avoid duplication, adjustments for interest, net for the periods ended September 30, 202\n5 and 2024 exclude $11 million and $4 million for the three-month periods, respectively, and $12 million and $5 million for the nine-month periods, respectively, which amounts are already included within “Certain Items.” See table included in “\n—Overview—Non-GAAP Fin\nancial Measures—\nCertain Items,” above.\n38\n(f)\nIncludes amortization of basis differences related to our joint ventures \nwhich was previously presented separately as amortization of excess cost of equity investments\n.\n(g)\nIncludes the tax provision on Certain Items recognized by the investees that are taxable entities associated with our Citrus, NGPL Holdings, and Products (SE) Pipe Line equity investments.

The increase in the nine-month period was further impacted by higher gathering rates on KinderHawk Field Services LLC. Overall, Midstream’s revenue changes are partially offset by corresponding changes in costs of sales.\nIn addition, Midstream was impacted by non-cash mark-to-market derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted commodity sales and purchases, primarily increasing costs of sales in the three-month period, and increasing revenues in the nine-month period, offset by a gain on sale of our Oklahoma assets in the nine-month 2024 period, all of which we treated as Certain Items.\n•\nThe \n$15\n million (4%) nine-month period increase in West was driven by a new service provided by Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company, L.L.C. to its customers in 2025.\n41\nProducts Pipelines (including reconciliation of Segment EBDA to Adjusted Segment EBDA)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions, except operating statistics)\nRevenues\n$\n677 \n$\n711 \n$\n2,031 \n$\n2,215 \nCosts of sales\n(281)\n(325)\n(866)\n(1,047)\nOther operating expenses(a)\n(121)\n(125)\n(360)\n(346)\nOther income\n— \n— \n1 \n— \nEarnings from equity investments\n13 \n16 \n44 \n43 \nSegment EBDA\n288\n \n277\n \n850\n \n865\n \nCertain Items:\nChange in fair value of derivative contracts\n— \n(1)\n1 \n— \nCertain Items(b)\n— \n(1)\n1 \n— \nAdjusted Segment EBDA\n$\n288 \n$\n276 \n$\n851 \n$\n865 \nChange from prior period\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSegment EBDA\n$\n11\n \n$\n(15)\nAdjusted Segment EBDA\n$\n12 \n$\n(14)\nVolumetric data(c)\nGasoline(d)\n978 \n1,010 \n976 \n980 \nDiesel fuel\n373 \n363 \n359 \n351 \nJet fuel\n301 \n302 \n309 \n298 \nTotal refined product volumes\n1,652 \n1,675 \n1,644 \n1,629 \nCrude and condensate\n459 \n472 \n479 \n474 \nTotal delivery volumes (MBbl/d)\n2,111 \n2,147 \n2,123 \n2,103 \n(a)\nOperating expenses include operations and maintenance expenses and taxes, other than income taxes.\n(b)\nSee table included in “\n—Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—\nCertain Items” above.

The increase in the nine-month period was further impacted by higher rates at our West Coast Terminals.\n•\nThe \n$5 million (8%) and $45\n million (21%) decreases, respectively, in Crude and Condensate were drive\nn by the expiration of legacy crude contracts in advance of the Double H pipeline conversion to NGL service partially offset, in the three-month period, by higher gathering volumes on our Bakken Crude assets. The decrease in the nine-month period was also driven by a planned ten-year turnaround in the first quarter 2025 at our KM Condensate Processing facility and lower margin from our Crude and Condensate business resulting primarily from decreased spreads.\n43\nTerminals (including reconciliation of Segment EBDA to Adjusted Segment EBDA)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions, except operating statistics)\nRevenues\n$\n518\n$\n498\n$\n1,569\n$\n1,503\nCosts of sales\n(9)\n(8)\n(38)\n(30)\nOther operating expenses(a)\n(225)\n(230)\n(678)\n(677)\nOther income\n—\n—\n—\n7\n(Loss) earnings from equity investments\n(10)\n2\n(6)\n6\nOther, net\n—\n6\n2\n9\nSegment EBDA\n$\n274\n$\n268\n$\n849\n$\n818\nCertain Items:\nChange in fair value of derivative contracts\n—\n(1)\n—\n(1)\nCertain Items(b)\n—\n(1)\n—\n(1)\nAdjusted Segment EBDA\n$\n274\n$\n267\n$\n849\n$\n817\nChange from prior period\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSegment EBDA\n$\n6\n$\n31\nAdjusted Segment EBDA\n7\n32\nVolumetric data(c)\nLiquids leasable capacity (MMBbl)\n78.7 \n78.6 \n78.7 \n78.6 \nLiquids utilization %(d)\n94.6 \n%\n94.9 \n%\n94.4 \n%\n94.3 \n%\nBulk transload tonnage (MMtons)\n12.3 \n13.4 \n37.6 \n41.1 \n(a)\nOperating expenses include operations and maintenance expenses and taxes, other than income taxes.\n(b)\nSee table included in “\n—Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—\nCertain Items” above.

The nine-month period decrease was further driven by lower realized CO\n2\n sales prices partially offset by higher volumes on our Wink pipeline.\n•\nT\nhe $3 million (3%) and $33 million (10%) decreases, respectively, in Oil and Gas Producing activities were driven by non-cash mark-to-market sales derivative hedge contracts in the three-month period, and in the nine-month period, a $41 million gain on sale of oil and gas producing fields in the 2024 period, all of which we treated as Certain Items.\nIn addition, Oil and Gas Producing activities were favorably impacted by lower power costs partially offset by lower crude oil volumes.  The nine-month period was further impacted by assets acquired in June 2024 and higher realized NGL prices and volumes partially offset by assets divested in June 2024. \n•\nThe $17 million (71%) and $7 \nmillion (18%) decreases, respectively, in Energy Transition Ventures were primarily due to higher operating costs and lower RIN sales prices. The nine-month period decrease was partially offset by higher RIN sales volumes.\nWe believe that our existing hedge contracts in place within our CO\n2\n business segment substantially mitigate commodity price sensitivities in the near-term and to a lesser extent over the following few years from price exposure.

Additionally, as of September 30, 2025, we had borrowing capacity of approximately $2.9 billion under our credit facility (discussed below in “—\nShort-term Liquidity\n”). As discussed further below, we believe our cash flows from operating activities, cash position, and remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility is more than adequate to allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations.\nWe have consistently generated substantial cash flows from operations, providing a source of funds of $4,225 million and $4,125 million in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. The period-to-period increase is discussed below in “\n—Cash Flows—Operating Activities\n.” We primarily rely on cash provided by operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service, sustaining capital expenditures, dividend payments, and our growth capital expenditures; however, we may access the debt capital markets from time to time to refinance our maturing long-term debt and finance incremental investments, if any. From time to time, short-term borrowings are used to fund working capital and finance incremental capital investments, if any. Incremental capital investments initially funded through short-term borrowings may periodically be replaced with long-term financing and/or paid down using retained cash from operations.\nWe use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities (senior notes) into variable-rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt, as detailed below:\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nVariable rate debt(a)\n$\n568 \n$\n371 \nNotional principal amount of fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements\n3,500 \n4,750 \nNotional principal amount of variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements(b)\n(1,500)\n(1,500)\nDebt balances subject to variable interest rates\n$\n2,568 \n$\n3,621 \n(a)\nIncludes $568 million and $331 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, of commercial paper notes. \n(b)\nConsist of interest rate swap agreements set to expire December 2025.\nOur board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2925 per share for the third quarter of 2025, a 2% increase over the dividend declared for the third quarter of 2024.\nIn February 2025 and June 2025, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, upgraded our rating outlook to positive. In August 2025, Fitch Ratings, Inc. upgraded our senior unsecured rating from BBB to BBB+.\nShort-term Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2025, our principal sources of short-term liquidity are (i) cash from operations; and (ii) our $3.5 billion credit facility with an available capacity of approximately $2.9 billion and an associated $3.5 billion commercial paper program. The loan commitments under our credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility. We provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and, as previously discussed, have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations.\nAs of September 30, 2025, our $1,081 million of short-term debt consisted primarily of commercial paper borrowings and senior notes that mature in the next twelve months. We intend to fund our debt as it becomes due, primarily through credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, cash flows from operations and/or issuing new long-term debt. Our short-term debt as of December 31, 2024 was $2,009 million.\nWe had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $1,420 million and $2,580 million as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The overall $1,160 million favorable change from year-end 2024 was primarily due to (i) a $1,125 million decrease in senior notes that mature in the next twelve months resulting from $1,500 million of senior notes that matured in June 2025; and (ii) a $181 million decrease in accrued interest, partially offset by a $237 million increase in commercial paper borrowings partly used to fund our Outrigger Energy acquisition. Generally, our working capital varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments, timing differences in the collection and \n48\npayment of receivables and payables, the change in fair value of our derivative contracts, and changes in our cash and cash equivalents as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe account for our capital expenditures in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, we distinguish between capital expenditures as follows:\nType of Expenditure\nPhysical Determination of Expenditure\nSustaining capital expenditures\n•\nInvestments to maintain the operational integrity and extend the useful life of our assets\nExpansion capital expenditures (discretionary capital expenditures)\n•\nInvestments to expand throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the making or acquisition of additions or improvements\nBudgeting of maintenance capital expenditures, which we refer to as sustaining capital expenditures, is done annually on a bottom-up basis. For each of our assets, we budget for and make those sustaining capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations, meet customer needs, and comply with our operating policies and applicable law. We may budget for and make additional sustaining capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency and/or lowering future expenses. Budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures generally occurs periodically throughout the year on a project-by-project basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures. Assets comprising expansion capital projects could result in additional sustaining capital expenditures over time. The need for sustaining capital expenditures in respect of newly constructed assets tends to be minimal but tends to increase over time as such assets age and experience wear and tear. Regardless of whether assets result from sustaining or expansion capital expenditures, once completed, the addition of such assets to our depreciable asset base will impact our calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization over the remaining useful lives of the impacted or resulting assets.\nGenerally, the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as sustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level. The classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as sustaining capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process, but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion.\nOur capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and the amount we expect to spend for the remainder of 2025 to sustain our assets and expand our business are as follows: \nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n2025 Remaining\nExpected 2025\n(In millions)\nCapital expenditures:\nSustaining capital expenditures\n$\n678 \n$\n260 \n$\n938 \nExpansion capital expenditures\n1,460 \n722 \n2,182 \nAccrued capital expenditures, contractor retainage, and other\n68 \n— \n— \nCapital expenditures\n$\n2,206 \n$\n982 \n$\n3,120 \nAdd:\nSustaining capital expenditures of unconsolidated joint ventures(a)\n$\n131 \n$\n53 \n$\n184 \nInvestments in unconsolidated joint ventures(b)\n150 \n16 \n166 \nLess: Consolidated joint venture partners’ sustaining capital expenditures\n(6)\n(4)\n(10)\nLess: Consolidated joint venture partners’ expansion capital expenditures\n(8)\n— \n(8)\nLess: Insurance reimbursement related to a sustaining capital expenditure\n(14)\n— \n(14)\nAcquisition\n648 \n— \n648 \nAccrued capital expenditures, contractor retainage, and other\n(68)\n— \n— \nTotal capital investments\n$\n3,039 \n$\n1,047 \n$\n4,086 \n(a)\nSustaining capital expenditures by our joint ventures generally do not require cash outlays by us.\n49\n(b)\nReflects cash contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures.

Also includes contributions to an unconsolidated joint venture that are netted within the amount the joint venture declares as a distribution to us.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere have been no material changes in our obligations with respect to other entities that are not consolidated in our financial statements that would affect the disclosures presented as of December 31, 2024 in our 2024 Form 10-K.\nCommitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were $1,173 million and $809 million, respectively. The increase of $364 million was primarily driven by an increase of capital commitments related to our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities between 2025 and 2024:\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\nChanges\n(In millions)\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in)\nOperating activities\n$\n4,225 \n$\n4,125 \n$\n100 \nInvesting activities\n(2,702)\n(1,858)\n(844)\nFinancing activities\n(1,604)\n(2,230)\n626 \nNet (Decrease) Increase in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Deposits\n$\n(81)\n$\n37 \n$\n(118)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was higher for the comparable nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 driven by greater contributions from our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.\n50\nInvesting Activities\n$844 million more cash used in investing activities in the comparable nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is explained by the following discussion:\n•\n$648 million in cash used for the Outrigger Energy acquisition in the 2025 period; and\n•\na $349 million increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by expansion projects in our Natural Gas Pipelines, CO\n2\n, and Products Pipelines business segments, partially offset by a decrease in our Terminals business segment; partially offset by\n•\na $152 million increase in distributions from equity investments primarily driven by our investment in SNG resulting from the receipt of our proportional share of debt refinancing.\nFinancing Activities\n$626 million less cash used in financing activities in the comparable nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 primarily due to debt raised for our Outrigger Energy acquisition in 2025.\nDividends\nWe expect to declare dividends of $1.17 per share on our stock for 2025. The table below reflects our 2025 dividends declared:\nThree months ended\nTotal quarterly dividend per share for the period\nDate of declaration\nDate of record\nDate of dividend\nMarch 31, 2025\n$\n0.2925 \nApril 16, 2025\nApril 30, 2025\nMay 15, 2025\nJune 30, 2025\n0.2925 \nJuly 16, 2025\nJuly 31, 2025\nAugust 15, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2025\n0.2925 \nOctober 22, 2025\nNovember 3, 2025\nNovember 17, 2025\nThe actual amount of dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, business prospects, capital requirements, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws, Delaware laws, and other factors. See Item 1A. “\nRisk Factors—Risks Related to Ownership of Our Capital Stock—The guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates. Circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.\n” of our 2024 Form 10-K. All of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors when declaring dividends.\nOur dividends are not cumulative. Consequently, if dividends on our stock are not paid at the intended levels, our stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future. Our dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each February, May, August, and November.\n51\nSummarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nKMI and certain subsidiaries (Subsidiary Issuers) are issuers of certain debt securities. KMI and substantially all of KMI’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors), are parties to a cross guarantee agreement whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of specified indebtedness of each other party to the agreement. Accordingly, with the exception of certain subsidiaries identified as subsidiary non-guarantors (Subsidiary Non-Guarantors), the parent issuer, Subsidiary Issuers, and Subsidiary Guarantors (the “Obligated Group”) are all guarantors of each series of our guaranteed debt (Guaranteed Notes). As a result of the cross guarantee agreement, a holder of any of the Guaranteed Notes issued by KMI or a Subsidiary Issuer is in the same position with respect to the net assets and income of KMI and the Subsidiary Issuers and Guarantors. The only amounts that are not available to the holders of each of the Guaranteed Notes to satisfy the repayment of such securities are the net assets and income of the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors.\nIn lieu of providing separate financial statements for the Obligated Group, we have presented the accompanying supplemental summarized combined income statement and balance sheet information for the Obligated Group based on Rule 13-01 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. Also, see Exhibit 10.1 to this report “\nCross Guarantee Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2014, among KMI and certain of its subsidiaries, with schedules updated as of September 30, 2025.\n”\nAll significant intercompany items among the Obligated Group have been eliminated in the supplemental summarized combined financial information. The Obligated Group’s investment balances in Subsidiary Non-Guarantors have been excluded from the supplemental summarized combined financial information. Significant intercompany balances and activity for the Obligated Group with other related parties, including Subsidiary Non-Guarantors (referred to as “affiliates”), are presented separately in the accompanying supplemental summarized combined financial information.\nExcluding fair value adjustments, as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Obligated Group had $31,707 million and $31,052 million, respectively, of Guaranteed Notes outstanding.\nSummarized combined balance sheet and income statement information for the Obligated Group follows:\nSummarized Combined Balance Sheet Information\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nCurrent assets\n$\n2,146 \n$\n2,216 \nCurrent assets - affiliates\n753 \n735 \nNoncurrent assets\n64,353 \n63,267 \nNoncurrent assets - affiliates\n781 \n813 \nTotal Assets\n$\n68,033 \n$\n67,031 \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n3,534 \n$\n4,737 \nCurrent liabilities - affiliates\n755 \n758 \nNoncurrent liabilities\n36,034 \n34,052 \nNoncurrent liabilities - affiliates\n1,760 \n1,561 \nTotal Liabilities\n42,083 \n41,108 \nKinder Morgan, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity\n25,950 \n25,923 \nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\n$\n68,033 \n$\n67,031 \nSummarized Combined Income Statement Information\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\n(In millions)\nRevenues\n$\n3,784 \n$\n11,377 \nOperating income\n923 \n2,955 \nNet income\n505 \n1,708 \n52"
