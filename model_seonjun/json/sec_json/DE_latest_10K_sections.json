A strategic alignment of products and solutions around our customers’ production systems. Production systems refer to the series of steps our customers take to execute different tasks, operations, and projects to grow an agricultural product or execute a project. \n2.\nTechnology Stack\n. Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to our customers through hardware and devices, embedded software, connectivity, data platforms, and applications. The technology stack leverages these core technologies across the enterprise, including digital capabilities, automation and machine learning, autonomy, and alternative power technologies. The stack has the potential to unlock economic and sustainable value for customers by optimizing jobs, strengthening decision-making, and better connecting the steps of a production system. \n3.\nLifecycle Solutions\n. The enterprise integration of our aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product, and with a specific lifecycle solution focus on the ownership experience. This integrated support seeks to enhance customer value through proactive and reactive support, easy access to parts, value-add services, and precision upgrades, regardless of when a customer purchases our equipment.\nOur Leap Ambitions are a framework designed to boost economic value and sustainability for our customers. The Leap Ambitions set goals to measure the results of our Smart Industrial Operating Model. The ambitions align across our customers’ production systems, seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources. \nThe Leap Ambitions framework has three components: (i) size the incremental market opportunity, quantifying the value that can be created; (ii) identify the key actions required to guide investment in digitalization, autonomy, automation, and alternative power technologies; and (iii) define the desired financial and sustainable outcomes we hope to achieve to help investors and stakeholders understand the opportunities that can be unlocked in the future through present investments. Current financial and sustainability goals for the Leap Ambitions relate to workforce safety, agriculture customer outcomes, product circularity, environmental footprint, Solutions as a Service, and equipment operations operating return on sales (OROS). \nWe aim to deliver ongoing value across our product lines by digitally connecting certain equipment we produce, enabling our customers to leverage technology for better economic and more sustainable outcomes in their businesses. We are measuring our customers’ utilization of our technology, in part, by the number of engaged acres, which is a measure of our PPA and SAT customers’ use of the John Deere Operations Center (our online farm management system). Engaged acres generally reflects the number of unique acres with at least one operation pass recorded in the Operations Center in the past 12 months. We are also introducing viable alternative power technologies for various product families. Furthermore, we plan to enhance how we deliver value by investing in a Solutions as a Service business model.\nWe also aim to enable our customers to be more sustainable in their production steps. For example, we provide our agricultural customers with technology solutions that help to improve their crops’ nitrogen use efficiency and increase their crops’ protection efficiency. Across all segments we believe we will deliver ongoing value by continuing to focus on reducing the CO\n2\ne emissions from our equipment, including offering hybrid-electric and electric options where feasible in our product families. We also continue to work toward production of a fully autonomous, battery-powered agricultural tractor and have launched several models of electric turf and compact construction products. We also expect to support sustainable outcomes and deliver value through increasing the use of grade management control for earthmoving customers, intelligent boom control for forestry customers, and precision solutions for roadbuilding customers. \nEquipment Operations\nOur equipment operations consist of three of our business segments: PPA, SAT, and CF. In fiscal year 2024, PPA generated $20,834 net sales, or 47 percent of equipment operations net sales; SAT generated $10,969 net sales, or 24 percent of equipment operations net sales; and CF generated $12,956 net sales, or 29 percent of equipment operations net sales. \nProduction and Precision Agriculture \nThe PPA segment is committed to meeting the fundamental needs of our customers through a combination of equipment and technology designed to enable our customers to overcome some of their biggest challenges: doing more with less, labor shortages, volatile input costs, and executing jobs in tighter timeframes. This segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions for production-scale growers of crops like large grains (such as corn and soy), small grains (such as wheat, oats, and barley), cotton, and sugarcane. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, sugarcane harvesters, and related harvesting front-end equipment. In addition, the segment includes tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers and nutrient management and soil preparation machinery.\n3\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to invest in the development and production of advanced technology through integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies across our portfolio of equipment. For example, we have advanced our planting and crop care offerings for corn and soy production systems to better meet customer demands throughout the cultivation cycle. \nWe have developed a differentiated, production system-level approach that helps us understand how customers operate, focusing on their costs, identifying the opportunities for them to reduce inputs, and improving productivity, crop yields, and sustainability. Advancements such as precise global navigation satellite systems technology, advanced connectivity and telematics, on-board sensors and computing power, automation software, digital tools, applications, and analytics provide seamless integration of information designed to improve customer decision-making and job execution. Our advanced telematics systems remotely connect equipment owners, business managers, and dealers to equipment in the field. This connection provides real-time alerts and information about equipment location, utilization, performance, and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as to monitor agronomic job execution. \nIn fiscal year 2024, we introduced the new S7 Series combines and updated 9RX tractors, designed to enhance customer value and address key agricultural challenges, such as time constraints caused by variable weather, labor shortages, and rising costs. The S7 Series combines feature advanced automation packages and the 9RX tractors come with new engine options, updated technology packages, and modernized cabins. \nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of PPA products and their associated brand names:\n​\nPRODUCT\nBRAND NAME\nSprayers\nHagie, Mazzotti\nPlanters and Cultivators\nMonosem\nSprayers and Planters\nPLA\nCarbon Fiber Sprayer Booms\nKing Agro\nSugarcane Harvester Aftermarket Parts\nSunbelt Outdoor Products, Unimil by John Deere\nAftermarket Parts for PPA Products\nVapormatic, A & I, Unimil, Alternatives by John Deere, Frontier\n​\nSmall Agriculture and Turf \nSAT is committed to meeting the needs of our customers through defining, developing, and delivering global equipment and technology solutions designed to unlock value and sustainability for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop and small acre crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment works to provide product leadership while extending integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies across its portfolio of equipment to unlock incremental value for customers. \nEquipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes certain mid-size, small and utility tractors, and related loaders and attachments; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and other residential, commercial, golf, and sports turf care applications; and hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers, and mowers. SAT equipment is sold primarily through independent retail dealer networks, although the segment also builds turf products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowe’s. Our turf equipment is sold primarily in North American, Western European, and Australian markets.\nIn the small agriculture market, we have introduced autonomous solutions, connectivity capabilities, and a path to electrifying our future by delivering a portfolio that helps current customers meet sustainability goals while finding innovative ways to serve new customers and unlock new markets for mechanization at scale. \n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of SAT products and their associated brand names:\n​\nPRODUCT\nBRAND NAME\nEquipment Attachments\nFrontier, Kemper, GreenSystem, Smart Apply\nAftermarket Parts for SAT\nVapormatic, A&I, Alternatives by John Deere, Frontier\n​\nAgriculture and Turf Operations\nSmart Industrial Operating Model\n. As part of our Smart Industrial Operating Model, the segments are aligned around production systems, enabling focus on delivering equipment, technology, and solutions across all the jobs customers execute during a season. Sales and marketing support for both the PPA and SAT segments is organized around four geographic regions: U.S., Canada, and Australia; Latin America and South America; Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); and Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.\nBusiness Environment\n. Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies, including global trade policies, and the amount and timing of government payments. Sales also are influenced by general economic conditions, farmland prices, farmers’ debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, labor availability and costs, energy costs and related policies, tax policies, policies related to climate change, and other input costs associated with farming. Other key factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value, age, and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment, and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions also can affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.\nWith challenging economic conditions including higher interest rates and decreasing crop prices, innovations in machinery and technology may have an even greater influence on agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations to increase profits. Large, cost-efficient, highly mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. These customers are increasingly adopting and integrating precision agricultural technologies like guidance, telematics, automation, and data management in their operations. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to us. A large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, are comprised of (1) tractors over 100 horsepower, (2) self-propelled combines, cotton pickers, forage harvesters, and sprayers, and (3) seeding equipment. In addition, small tractors are an important part of our global business. \nRetail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment are influenced by the housing market, weather conditions, consumer spending patterns, and general economic conditions like unemployment, interest rates, and inflation.\nSeasonality\n. Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment can result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year. Seasonal demand is estimated in advance, and equipment is manufactured in anticipation of such demand to achieve efficient utilization of personnel and facilities throughout the year. The PPA and SAT segments can incur substantial seasonal variations in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural and turf equipment. The segments also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand.\nFor certain equipment, we offer early order programs, which can include discounts to retail customers who place orders well in advance of the use season. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs; however, during periods of high demand, some factories may still produce after the use season. New combines, cotton harvesting equipment, and sprayers are sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during non-use seasons. \nIn Australia, Canada, and the U.S., there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions that take place in connection with most new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to our dealers in these countries for carrying and ultimately selling this used inventory to retail customers, we provide these dealers with pools of funds awarded as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales at the time of the new equipment settlement.\nRetail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters. We have pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories throughout the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail\n sales. \n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConstruction and Forestry\nOur CF segment is committed to meeting the need for smart and more sustainable solutions to help our customers meet industry challenges, including jobsite safety, a shortage of skilled labor, volatile input costs, reducing rework, maximizing uptime, and minimizing their environmental footprint. \nTo address these challenges and unlock value for customers, we deliver a robust portfolio of construction, roadbuilding, and forestry products with precision technology solutions. Our smart solutions such as SmartWeigh™, grade control offerings, machine and system automation, and Operations Center, are designed to allow customers to complete more functions with fewer inputs, reduce rework and guesswork, and transform data into insights to allow for better decisions. \nObstacle detection solutions such as SmartDetect™\n \nsupplement operator visibility on the jobsite through a combination of cameras, radar, and machine learning. Additionally, we plan to deliver hybrid-electric and battery electric equipment solutions to help customers reduce tailpipe emissions without sacrificing power and performance. \nOur primary construction products include excavators, wheel loaders, motor graders, dozers, backhoes, articulated dump trucks, skid steers, compact excavators, and compact track loaders, along with a variety of attachments. Our Wirtgen roadbuilding products include milling machines, pavers, compactors, rollers, crushers, screens, and asphalt plants. Similar to the construction product lineup, the Wirtgen brand also provides a technology stack aimed at allowing customers to make smarter and more sustainable decisions. Technology offerings include Wirtgen Performance Tracker, Mill Assist, Level Pro, Vögele Roadscan, Smart Compact, WITOS Paving, Spective Connect, AutoTrac™, and John Deere Connected Support™.\nIn forestry, our primary products include skidders, wheeled and tracked feller bunchers, forwarders, knuckleboom loaders, wheeled and tracked harvesters, swing machines, and precision forestry technology solutions such as Intelligent Boom Control, TimberMatic™ maps, and TimberManager™. These solutions allow customers to closely track jobsite progress and provide visibility into fleet location, utilization, performance, and maintenance information. \nWe have a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving, roadbuilding, and material handling equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for our dealers and expanded cooperation with major national equipment rental companies. \nWe own retail forestry sales operations in Australia, Brazil, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Wirtgen Group sells its products primarily through company-owned sales and service subsidiaries in many markets worldwide (most significantly in Europe, India, and Australia). In most other geographies, we sell through an independent dealer channel. \nThe prevailing levels of residential, commercial, and public construction, investment in infrastructure, and the condition of the forestry products industry influence retail sales of our construction, roadbuilding, and forestry equipment. General economic conditions, interest rates, the availability of credit, and certain commodity prices, such as those applicable to oil and gas, pulp, paper, and saw logs, also influence sales.\nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of CF products and their associated brand names:\n​\nPRODUCT\nBRAND NAME\nRoadbuilding Equipment\nWirtgen, Vögele, Hamm, Kleemann, Benninghoven, Ciber\nForestry Attachments\nWaratah\n​\nCompetition\nThe equipment operations sell products and services in a variety of competitive global and regional markets. The principal competitive factors in all markets include product performance, innovation, quality, distribution, sustainability, customer service, and value. John Deere’s brand recognition is a competitive factor in North America and many other parts of the world.\nThe agricultural equipment industry continues to change and is becoming even more competitive through the emergence and global expansion of many competitors.

These materials and components include a variety of steel products, metal castings, forgings, plastics, hydraulics, electronics, and ready-to-assemble components made to certain specifications. We also source various goods and services used for production, logistics, offices, and research and development. We develop and maintain sourcing strategies for our purchased materials and emphasize long-term supplier relationships at the core of these strategies. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to drive innovation, ensure availability and delivery of raw materials and components, manage costs on a globally competitive basis, protect our intellectual property, and minimize other supply-related risks. We are focused on proactively increasing the resiliency of our supply chain and actively monitoring supply chain risks to minimize the likelihood of business disruptions caused by the supply base, including supplier financial viability, capacity, business continuity, labor availability, quality, delivery, cybersecurity, weather-related events, and natural disasters. We have implemented mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of potential and actual supply chain disruptions on our customers. Examples include working with the supply base to prioritize allocations to improve material availability, multi-sourcing selected parts and materials, entering long-term contracts for some critical components, and using alternative freight carriers to expedite delivery. \nBacklog Orders\nThe dollar amount of backlog orders as of October 27, 2024 was approximately $5.2 billion for the PPA segment and $2.1 billion for the SAT segment, compared with $7.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, at October 29, 2023. The agriculture and turf backlog are generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries.\n The dollar amount of backlog orders for the CF segment was approximately $2.2 billion at October 27, 2024, compared with $6.4 billion at October 29, 2023. Backlog orders for equipment operations include all orders deemed to be firm as of the referenced date. \nBacklog orders decreased as demand has declined.\nFinancial Services\nU.S. and Canada.\n The financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from our dealers of new equipment manufactured by our agricultural and turf and construction and forestry operations, as well as used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. The Company and John Deere Construction & Forestry Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) are referred to as the “sales companies.” John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. In Canada, John Deere Financial Inc., a Canadian financial services subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Canada ULC, our Canadian sales company. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies. The financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agricultural and turf markets. Additionally, the financial services operations provide wholesale financing to dealers of our agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment (wholesale notes), primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. The various financing options offered by the financial services operations are designed to enhance sales of our products and generate financing income for the financial services operations. In the U.S. and Canada, certain subsidiaries included in the financial services segment offer extended equipment warranties.\nRetail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations. The equipment operations are the financial services operations’ major source of business, although many retail purchasers of our products finance their purchases outside our organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.\nThe financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local governments. \nLeases are usually written for periods ranging from less than one year to seven years, and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases also are offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada.\nThe financial services operations’ terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) generally provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest rates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations. \nWe have an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any four consecutive fiscal quarterly periods. We also have committed to continuing to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. Our obligations to make payments to \n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCapital Corporation under this agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Further, our obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Our obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. As of October 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our obligations, and no payments were required under this agreement in fiscal year 2024 or fiscal year 2023. As of October 27, 2024, we indirectly owned 100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation’s capital stock and Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth was $6,226.2 million.\nOutside the U.S. and Canada. \nThe financial services operations also offer financing, primarily for our products, in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, New Zealand, and in several other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In certain markets, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures with other financial institutions. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a Brazilian bank, Banco Bradesco S.A. (Bradesco), for Bradesco to invest and become 50 percent owner of our subsidiary in Brazil, Banco John Deere S.A.. The way the financial services operations offer financing is affected by a variety of country-specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, which are subject to change, and which may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations.\nThe financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing primarily for the purchase of our products.\nAdditional information on the financial services operations is provided in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which we conduct business. We strive to comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, in the event of noncompliance, we could be subject to fines and other penalties. Compliance with these laws and regulations adds to the cost of our production operations and compliance with emissions regulations adds to the cost of our products. In fiscal year 2024, compliance with environmental controls applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. At this time, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to environmental controls during fiscal year 2025. In addition to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint through our Leap Ambitions framework and seek opportunities to reduce environmental impacts on the communities where we operate.\nThe U.S., the European Union (EU), India, and other governments throughout the world have enacted, and continue to enact, laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. Compliance with these regulations requires significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and after-treatment systems. \nGovernments also are implementing laws regulating products across their life cycles, including raw material sourcing and the storage, distribution, sale, use, and disposal of products at their end of life. These laws and regulations include requirements to develop less hazardous chemical substances and products, right-to-know, restriction of hazardous substances, and product take-back laws. \nWe are evaluating, cleaning-up, or conducting corrective action at a limited number of sites. We do not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities we may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws, regulations, or the clean-up of any additional properties, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or competitive position.\nWe continue to monitor and review developing sustainability frameworks, standards, and global regulations.\nWith respect to properties and businesses that have been or will be acquired, we conduct due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities but cannot be certain that we have identified, or will identify, all adverse environmental conditions. \nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. These laws and regulations include a range of trade, product, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, foreign exchange, employment, tax, environmental, safety, data privacy, telecommunications, antitrust, and other laws and regulations. \nCompliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of our employees, as well as financial resources. In fiscal year 2024, compliance with the regulations applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. At this time, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with regulations during fiscal year 2025. Additional information about the impact of government \nregulations on our business is included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Strategy Risks” and “Compliance Risks.”\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital\nOur employees are guided by a simple principle: We run so life can leap forward. Employees are further guided by our Code of Business Conduct (Code), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since our founding. And while our world and business may change, we continue to be guided by our core values — Integrity, Quality, Humanity, Commitment, and Innovation. Humanity was added as our fifth core value in fiscal year 2024.\nEmployees\nAt October 27, 2024, we had approximately 75,800 employees, of which approximately 35,200 are full-time production employees. We had 29,600 total employees in the U.S. of which approximately 13,300 were production employees. We also retain consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers.\nUnions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 77 percent of our U.S. production and maintenance employees. Approximately 8,900 of our active U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with an expiration date of November 1, 2027. A small number of U.S. production employees are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Collective bargaining agreements covering our employees in the U.S. expire between 2025 and 2027. Unions also represent the majority of employees at our manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. \nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements or whether such agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us. For further discussion, see “Risk Factors—Disputes with labor unions may adversely affect our ability to operate in our facilities as well as impact our financial results.” \nCode of Business Conduct\nWe are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We require all employees to complete training on our Code and also require that employees regularly certify compliance with the Code. The Code provides specific guidance to all our employees outlining how they can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since our founding. In addition, we maintain a global compliance hotline to report concerns of potential violations of the Code, global policies, or the law. \nHealth and Safety\nWe strive to achieve safety excellence through increased focus on injury prevention, leading indicators, risk reduction, and health and safety management systems. We have made progress on implementing best practices and leading indicators for enabling employee safety over recent years with our Health and Safety Management System.\nWe utilize a safety balanced scorecard, which includes leading and lagging indicators, and is designed to enable continuous measurement of safety performance and drive continuous improvement. Leading indicators include incident corrective action closure rates, ergonomic scorecard, and risk reduction from safety and ergonomic risk assessment projects. Lagging indicators include total recordable incident rate, ergonomic recordable case rate, lost time frequency rate, and near-miss rate. Leading and lagging indicators are tracked by most of our manufacturing facilities and internally reported. In fiscal year 2024, we reported a total recordable incident rate of 1.69 and a lost time frequency rate of 0.63. To improve our total recordable incident rate, we will prioritize injury prevention and risk reduction strategies and improve ergonomic programs.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \nWe are an equal opportunity employer committed to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination. We believe that a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve is essential to our long-term success. For recruiting and development opportunities, we work with a variety of professional organizations to support a diverse pipeline of candidates representing the fields of accounting, agriculture, engineering, general business, science, and technology, and provide development opportunities for employees.\nCompensation & Benefits\nOur total rewards are intended to be competitive, meet the varied needs of our global workforce, and reinforce our values. We are committed to providing comprehensive and competitive pay and benefits to our employees. We continue to invest in employees through growth and development and well-being initiatives.\nOur work environment is designed to promote innovation, well-being, and reward performance. Our total rewards for employees include a variety of components that aim to support our employees in building a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning base pay, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to our goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEligible full-time employees in the U.S. have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; parental leave and paid time off; and mental health and wellness services. We also offer a variety of working arrangements to eligible employees, including flexible schedules, remote work, and job sharing to help employees manage home and work-life situations. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.\nTraining and Development \nAround the world, we offer internships, training, upskilling, apprenticeships, and leadership development at all stages of an employee’s career. Training programs are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions and include topics such as technical operation of equipment, equipment assembly, relationships with customers and dealers, our culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance with anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment policies, sexual harassment policies, and leadership development.\nAvailable Information\n \nOur internet address is \nhttp://www.deere.com\n.
