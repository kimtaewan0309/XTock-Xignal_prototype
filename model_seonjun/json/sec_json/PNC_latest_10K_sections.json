  "item1": "ITEM 1 – BUSINESS\nBusiness Overview\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial institutions in the U.S. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located coast-to-coast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S. At December 31, 2024, our consolidated total assets, total deposits and total shareholders’ equity were $560.0 billion, $426.7 billion and $54.4 billion, respectively.\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation. Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through organic growth, strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and equity investments, and the formation of various non-banking subsidiaries. We offer a broad range of deposit, credit and fee-based products and services to serve our customers. See Note 22 Segment Reporting for additional details regarding our products and services. \nSignature Bank Portfolio Acquisition\nOn October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately $16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition. \nSubsidiaries\nOur corporate legal structure at December 31, 2024 consisted of one domestic subsidiary bank, including its subsidiaries, and 53 active non-bank subsidiaries, in addition to various affordable housing investments and historic rehabilitation investments. Our bank subsidiary is PNC Bank, a national bank chartered in Wilmington, Delaware. For additional information on certain of our subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 to this Report.\nSupervision and Regulation\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a BHC registered under the BHC Act and a financial holding company under the GLB Act. PNC primarily conducts its business through its domestic bank subsidiary, PNC Bank, a national banking association chartered and located in Wilmington, Delaware.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding our regulatory matters. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments, impose conditions and requirements on the products and services we offer and the manner in which they are offered and sold, and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, investment management and other customers, among other things. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. The consequences of noncompliance with these, or other applicable laws or regulations, can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions. See the additional information included \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n1\n \nas Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report discussing the impact of the regulatory environment on us and the financial services industry.\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and examination by many regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory policies of the agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, the ability and performance of management and the Board of Directors, the effectiveness of internal controls and internal audit function, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.\nThe results of examination activity by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity and take enforcement action, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements, against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines, among other things, that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable law or regulations, are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice. This supervisory framework, including the examination reports and supervisory ratings (which are not publicly available) of the agencies, could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for compliance with most federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws relating to fair lending and prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products or services, and for enforcing such laws with respect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The results of the CFPB’s examinations (which are not publicly available) also can result in restrictions or limitations on the operations of a regulated entity as well as enforcement actions against a regulated entity, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements.\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of our status as a public company and by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature of some of our businesses. Our businesses with operations outside the U.S. also are subject to regulation by appropriate authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which they do business.\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the operation and growth of our businesses. The Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers, and certain of the regulators have the power to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our applications or notices to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses, assets or deposits, expand our operations geographically or reconfigure existing operations.\nAmong the areas that have been receiving a high level of regulatory focus are compliance with the BSA/AML laws, capital and liquidity management (including contingency, recovery, and resolution planning), the structure and effectiveness of enterprise risk management frameworks, the protection of confidential customer information, cybersecurity, the oversight of arrangements with third-party vendors and suppliers, providing fair access to financial services to customers and potential customers, and compliance with fair lending and other consumer protection laws and regulations, including those governing retail sales practices, fee disclosures, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, collection practices and protections for military service members.\nNew legislation, changes in rules promulgated by federal financial regulators, other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may directly affect the operations and profitability of our businesses. Given the new presidential administration, we anticipate new legislative and regulatory initiatives over the next several years, focused specifically on banking and other financial services in which we are engaged. These initiatives may include, for example, the rescission or re-proposal of regulations, policies, and guidance issued under the prior administration, and could also affect the agencies’ approach to ongoing federal court litigation involving regulations issued under the prior administration. Whether and how these developments may impact the rules and policies applicable to us remains unclear at this point. The more detailed description of the significant regulations to which we are subject included in this Report is based on current laws and regulations and is subject to potentially material change. For additional information on the impact of the regulatory environment on us and the financial services industry, see Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report.\nThe profitability of our businesses also is affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial sectors in general, including laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation, electronic commerce, data security and privacy.\nThere are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, the following discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws, regulations and policies that apply to us. To a substantial extent, the purpose of the regulation and supervision of financial services institutions and their holding companies is not to protect our shareholders and our non-customer creditors, but rather to protect our customers (including depositors), the financial markets and financial system in general.\n2\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nBanking Regulation and Supervision\nRegulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital Planning\n. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. The foundation of the agencies’ regulatory capital rules is the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee, the international body responsible for developing global regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions. The regulatory capital rules establish minimum requirements for the ratio of a banking organization’s regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets, referred to as risk-based capital requirements, as well as for the ratio of its regulatory capital to measures of assets and other exposures, referred to as leverage capital requirements. The agencies’ regulatory capital rules have undergone significant change since 2013, when the agencies adopted final rules to implement the Basel Committee’s international regulatory capital framework, known as “Basel III”, as well as certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. On July 27, 2023, and as described in more detail below, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC proposed for public comment an interagency rule to implement the final components of the Basel III framework that would significantly revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank.\nThe federal banking agencies currently tailor the application of their capital, liquidity and enhanced prudential requirements for banking organizations to the asset size and risk profile (as measured by certain regulatory metrics) of the banking organization. The agencies’ capital and liquidity rules classify all BHCs with $100 billion or more in total assets into one of four categories (Category I, Category II, Category III and Category IV), with the most stringent capital and liquidity requirements applying to Category I firms and the least restrictive requirements applying to Category IV firms. The classification of any bank subsidiary of a BHC generally follows that of its parent BHC. PNC and PNC Bank currently are Category III firms because PNC (i) has more than $250 billion, but less than $700 billion, in consolidated total assets, (ii) is not designated as a GSIB, and (iii) has less than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity. Under current rules, if any of these items were no longer the case, PNC and PNC Bank would become a Category I or II institution, and subject to more stringent capital and liquidity standards. As of December 31, 2024, PNC had cross-jurisdictional activities for these purposes of $24.0 billion. Some of the benefits of tailored application of capital, liquidity, and enhanced prudential requirements under current rules may be reversed if the agencies adopt, as proposed, certain rules issued in 2023 for comment as described further below. \nThe regulatory capital rules generally divide regulatory capital into three components: CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital (which, together with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is generally common stock, retained earnings, and qualifying minority interests less required deductions. As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available-for-sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests, less required deductions. Tier 2 capital generally comprises qualifying subordinated debt and, subject to certain quantitative limits, ACL, less any required deductions from Tier 2 capital. The regulatory capital rules limit the extent to which minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries may be included in regulatory capital. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\nUnder the current regulatory capital rules, PNC and PNC Bank must deduct investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets (in each case, net of associated deferred tax liabilities) from CET1 capital to the extent such categories individually exceed 25% of the institution’s adjusted CET1 capital. As of December 31, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank’s investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets did not exceed this threshold.\nThe agencies’ capital rules permit banking organizations that were subject to CECL during 2020 to delay CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital. PNC elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is defined as the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC entered a three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard was phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, CECL will be fully reflected in regulatory capital. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for more detail on CECL and the ACL.\nPNC and PNC Bank are required to use the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios. The standardized approach for risk-weighted assets takes into account credit and market risk. To calculate risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach for credit risk, the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are generally multiplied by risk weights set forth in the rules, with the risk weights increasing as the perceived credit risk of the relevant asset or exposure increases. For certain types of exposures, such as securitization exposures, the standardized approach establishes one or more methodologies that are to be used to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the exposure. High volatility commercial real estate, past due, and equity exposures, as well as MSRs and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital, are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures. Under the market risk capital rule, risk-weighted asset amounts for covered trading positions are determined based on the calculation of VaR (including stressed VaR), specific risk, incremental risk and comprehensive risk amounts, as specified in the capital rules.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n3\n \nWe refer to the capital ratios calculated using the definition of capital under the agencies’ Basel III capital rules and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted assets, as our Basel III regulatory capital ratios.\nThe risk-based capital rules establish certain minimum standards for the capital ratios of banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank. Banking organizations must maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a Total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets, to be considered “adequately capitalized.” BHCs subject to the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process, such as PNC, are subject to a CET1 SCB. The SCB is calculated based on the difference between a firm’s starting and minimum CET1 ratio (as projected by the Federal Reserve) in the supervisory severely adverse scenario during the CCAR process, plus four quarters of the organization’s planned common stock dividends (expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets), subject to a floor of 2.5%. Based on PNC’s performance under the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests as part of CCAR 2024, PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%. While PNC Bank is not subject to a SCB, PNC Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer in the form of CET1 equal to a fixed 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\nPNC and PNC Bank must maintain risk-based capital above the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements plus its SCB (in the case of PNC) or capital conservation buffer (in the case of PNC Bank) in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including paying dividends and executing repurchases or redemptions of any Tier 1 capital instrument, such as common and qualifying preferred stock, and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. As a result, to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments, PNC and PNC Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 10.5%. In addition, while a firm’s SCB is typically determined as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR process, the Federal Reserve has the right to conduct supervisory stress tests, require a firm to submit a revised capital plan and calculate a firm’s SCB more frequently. BHCs subject to a SCB, such as PNC, generally may increase their capital distributions without seeking prior Federal Reserve approval, provided the BHC otherwise complies with its SCB and any other applicable capital or capital distribution requirements. \nFor Category III banking organizations (such as PNC and PNC Bank), the Federal Reserve and OCC can supplement these higher SCB or capital conservation buffer levels above the regulatory minimums by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. This buffer, which must be held in the form of CET1 capital, is currently set at zero in the U.S. A Federal Reserve policy statement establishes the framework and factors the Federal Reserve would use in setting and adjusting the amount of the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer. Covered banking organizations would generally have 12 months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement, unless the Federal Reserve establishes an earlier effective date.\nThe regulatory capital rules also require that banking organizations maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital as compared to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio, and require Category III banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital as compared to total leverage exposure, referred to as the supplementary leverage ratio. Total leverage exposure takes into account on-balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. Banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%, and Category III banking organizations must maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. As of December 31, 2024, the leverage and supplementary leverage ratios of PNC and PNC Bank were above the required minimum level.\nPNC and PNC Bank are not currently subject to the additional CET1 capital surcharge, minimum long-term debt requirement, minimum total loss-absorbing capacity or enhanced supplementary leverage ratio requirements that apply to U.S. GSIBs. However, it is possible that the agencies may apply one or more of these requirements in the future to additional BHCs or insured depository institutions like PNC and PNC Bank. In August 2023, the federal banking agencies proposed rules that would require Category II, III, and IV bank holding companies and banks to issue and maintain minimum amounts of long-term debt that satisfy certain requirements. Additionally, Category II, III, and IV bank holding companies would be subject to “clean holding company” requirements, which would prohibit such companies from entering into certain financial arrangements and cap certain liabilities. PNC, as a Category III holding company, and PNC Bank would be subject to the proposed rules and would have a three-year phase-in period after any final rule to achieve compliance with the long-term debt requirements. If the long-term debt rules were finalized in their current form, we would expect to achieve compliance through normal course funding. \nFailure to meet applicable capital requirements could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal banking agencies, including limitations on capital distributions, the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital and, in severe cases, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. In some cases, the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The thresholds at which an insured depository institution is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” are based on (i) the institution’s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios; (ii) the institution’s leverage ratio; \n4\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nand (iii) for the definitions of “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized,” the institution’s supplementary leverage ratio (if applicable). Generally, the smaller an institution’s capital base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers. Business activities may also be affected by an institution’s capital classification. For example, PNC and PNC Bank must remain “well capitalized” for PNC to continue to take advantage of financial holding company status as described below.\nAt December 31, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” For additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, including the levels of capital required to be considered “well capitalized,” see the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report and Note 19 Regulatory Matters.\nThe federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule in July 2023 to implement the final components of the Basel III framework. The rule generally would align the regulatory capital elements and required deductions for Category III banking organizations, such as PNC and PNC Bank, with those currently applicable to Category I and II banking organizations and apply a new expanded risk-based approach for calculating risk-weighted assets (the “expanded risk-based approach”). Among other impacts, PNC and PNC Bank would be required to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital and deduct from CET1 capital, among other items, MSRs, deferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceed 10% of CET1 capital or in the aggregate with other threshold items that exceed 15% of CET1 capital. The new expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-weighted assets would apply more granular and standardized risk-weighting methodologies for credit, operational, market, equity and credit valuation adjustment risks. PNC and PNC Bank would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under the existing standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for their risk-based capital minimum and buffer requirements, including the SCB. The proposal included a proposed effective date for the final rule of July 1, 2025, with certain provisions having a three-year phase-in period, including the recognition of AOCI elements in regulatory capital and the increase in risk-weighted assets due to the expanded risk-based approach. Based on our December 31, 2024 balance sheet, PNC and PNC Bank expect to remain above the current minimum capital and buffer requirements if the proposal were finalized in its current form. In light of the change in the presidential administration, it is unclear whether the banking agencies will pursue the proposal or issue a revised proposal for comment. In any event, any rule is unlikely to be finalized and become effective by July 1, 2025.\nIn addition to regulatory capital requirements, we are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, capital stress testing requirements and CCAR process, as well as the DFAST requirements of the Federal Reserve and the OCC. \nAs part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital planning process of BHCs, including PNC, that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For us, this capital planning assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve that describes the Company’s planned capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, engage in common stock repurchase programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments during a nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, including a supervisory severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule provides that a BHC must resubmit a new capital plan prior to the next annual submission date if, among other things, there has been or will be a material change in the BHC’s risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. \nIn evaluating PNC’s capital plan, the Federal Reserve also considers a number of qualitative factors. In assessing a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes, the Federal Reserve considers whether the BHC has sound and effective governance to oversee these processes. The Federal Reserve’s evaluation focuses on whether a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes are supported by a strong risk management framework to identify, measure and assess material risks and that provides a strong foundation to capital planning. The Federal Reserve also considers the comprehensiveness of a BHC’s control framework and evaluates a BHC’s policy guidelines for capital planning and assessing capital adequacy. A BHC’s stress testing scenario design processes and approaches for estimating the impact of stress on its capital position, including stress testing models and non-model qualitative approaches, may be reviewed to ensure that projections reflect the impact of appropriately stressful conditions, as well as risks idiosyncratic to the BHC, on its capital position. Significant deficiencies in a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes may result in supervisory directives that require the firm to address the identified deficiencies and, potentially, a downgrade in the BHC’s supervisory capital positions and planning rating.\nIn connection with the 2025 CCAR exercise, we must file our capital plan and stress testing results using financial data as of December 31, 2024, with the Federal Reserve by April 7, 2025. In June 2025, we expect to receive PNC’s preliminary SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2025. The Federal Reserve must provide firms their final SCB for this period by August 31, 2025, which would reflect any changes made to the firm’s planned common stock dividends to remain in compliance with the firm’s SCB.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n5\n \nAs a Category III institution, PNC must conduct a company-run DFAST stress test in even numbered years and release PNC’s projections of certain revenue, loss and capital results from the exercise under the agencies’ hypothetical supervisory severely adverse macroeconomic scenario and applying the agencies’ DFAST capital action assumptions.\nAs part of the DFAST and annual CCAR processes, the Federal Reserve releases certain revenue, loss and capital results for each participating firm from its supervisory stress testing exercises. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that it will soon seek public comment on significant changes to improve the transparency of its bank stress tests and reduce the volatility of resulting capital buffer requirements, and several trade associations filed suit in federal district court to obtain changes to various CCAR and stress testing processes. It is unclear what, if any, changes to the CCAR and stress testing process may result from this expected rulemaking and ongoing litigation. \nRegulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity Risk Management Requirements\n. The Basel Committee’s Basel III framework also includes short-term liquidity standards and long-term funding standards, the LCR and NSFR, respectively.\nThe U.S. banking agencies’ LCR rules are designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and high-quality liquid assets to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions prescribed in the rules (net cash outflow). A company’s LCR is the amount of its high-quality liquid assets divided by its net cash outflows, expressed as a percentage, and as calculated under the rules. The regulatory minimum LCR that covered banking organizations are required to maintain is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis. If either institution’s LCR is below the minimum requirement for three consecutive business days, the institution must promptly provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum LCR requirement.\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. A covered BHC’s NSFR is the ratio of its available stable funding to its required stable funding amount (as calculated under the rules) over a one-year horizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all covered banking organizations (expressed as a percentage) is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily. If either institution’s NSFR falls, or is likely to fall below, the minimum requirement, the institution must provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum NSFR requirement.\nAs Category III institutions with less than $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to reduced LCR and NSFR requirements, with each company’s LCR net cash outflows and NSFR required stable funding (as calculated under the rules) reduced by 15%, thereby reducing the amount of high-quality liquid assets or available stable funding each institution must hold to meet the LCR and NSFR minimum requirements, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, PNC had weighted short-term wholesale funding for these purposes of $43.7 billion.  \nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including PNC, to publicly disclose certain quantitative and qualitative measures of their LCR- and NSFR-related liquidity profile. These disclosures include major components used to calculate the LCR and NSFR (\ne.g.\n, high-quality liquid assets, cash outflows and inflows for the LCR, and available stable funding and required stable funding for the NSFR, at the consolidated parent company), and a qualitative discussion of the BHC’s LCR and NSFR results, including, among other things, key drivers of the results, composition of high-quality liquid assets and available stable funding, and concentration of funding sources. \nAdditionally, as a Category III institution, PNC also must, among other things, conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net cash outflows under the BHC’s 30-day liquidity stress test and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets certain requirements.\nFor additional discussion of regulatory liquidity requirements, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nSource of Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends\n.\n The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends and other capital distributions from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject to various restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent, which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC Bank also is subject to federal laws limiting extensions of credit to its parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 19 Regulatory Matters. Further information on bank level liquidity and parent company liquidity is also available in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nFederal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is expected to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks if necessary. Dodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve jointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the FDIC to implement this source of strength requirement. These joint rules have not yet been proposed. Consistent with this source of strength policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a BHC generally should \n6\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nnot maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating in the CCAR exercise, such as PNC as discussed above, the Federal Reserve has expected capital plans to reflect conservative dividend payout ratios. \nEnhanced Prudential Requirements\n.\n Under Federal Reserve rules, PNC and other BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more are subject to various enhanced prudential standards related to liquidity risk management and overall risk management. For PNC, these rules, among other things, establish liquidity stress testing requirements (discussed above), limitations on PNC’s aggregate net credit exposures to any single, unaffiliated company (referred to as SCCL), and certain oversight and governance responsibilities for PNC’s Chief Risk Officer, the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the Federal Reserve’s SCCL rules, PNC’s aggregate net credit exposure (including exposure resulting from, among other transactions, extensions of credit, repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, investments in securities and derivative transactions) to any unaffiliated counterparty may not exceed 25% of PNC’s Tier 1 capital. \nThe Federal Reserve may continue to develop the set of enhanced prudential standards that apply to large BHCs in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the U.S. financial system. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nAdditional Powers Under the GLB Act\n. The GLB Act permits a qualifying BHC, such as PNC, to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in, or affiliate with companies engaging in, a broader range of financial activities than would otherwise be permitted for a BHC. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies, insurance agents and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company in 2000. A BHC qualifies to become a financial holding company if the BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and its subsidiary depository institutions have a rating under the CRA of “Satisfactory” or better. Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct merchant banking activities and securities underwriting and dealing activities. As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries are generally allowed to conduct new financial activities, and we generally are permitted to acquire non-bank financial companies that have less than $10 billion in assets, with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying national banks to engage in expanded activities through a “financial subsidiary.” PNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve (other than insurance underwriting activities, insurance company investment activities and merchant banking). In order to establish a financial subsidiary, a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” and the national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must have a CRA rating of “Satisfactory” or better.\nIf a financial holding company or a national bank with a financial subsidiary fails to continue to meet the applicable “well capitalized” or “well managed” criteria, the financial holding company or national bank must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among other things, identifies how the capital or management deficiencies will be corrected. Until such deficiencies are corrected, the relevant agency may impose limits or conditions on the activities of the company or bank, and the company or bank may not engage in, or acquire a company engaged in, the types of expanded activities only permissible for a financial holding company or financial subsidiary without prior approval of the relevant agency.\nIn addition, a financial holding company generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new activity, if any of its insured depository institutions receives a CRA rating of less than “Satisfactory.” A national bank’s financial subsidiary generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new financial activity, if the national bank or any of its insured depository institution affiliates received a CRA rating of less than “Satisfactory.” The CRA and its implementing regulations require the agencies to assess a bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of the communities in which they do business, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. At December 31, 2024, PNC Bank had a rating of “Outstanding” with respect to the CRA. On October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to amend the regulations implementing the CRA. The rule significantly expands the number of areas in which a bank is evaluated, materially changes the tests used to evaluate the bank in those areas and expands the data a bank must collect and report. In March 2024, before the final rule became effective, a federal court enjoined the federal banking agencies from enforcing the rule in its entirety, extending the effective date (originally set as April 1, 2024) and implementation dates by a day for each day that the injunction remains in place. If the final rule becomes effective, we expect the rule will increase PNC Bank’s obligations and compliance costs necessary to achieve a “Satisfactory” or “Outstanding” rating under the CRA.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n7\n \nVolcker Rule\n.\n The Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations prohibit banking entities from engaging in short-term trading as principal and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds, private equity funds, and certain other private funds (together, “covered funds”), unless an exemption or exception applies. For example, the exemptions under the Volcker Rule allow banking entities to trade as principal for securities underwriting, market making and risk-mitigating hedging purposes, subject to a variety of conditions. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to simplified and tailored compliance program requirements because each entity has trading assets and liabilities of less than $20 billion.\nOther Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision\n. The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate based on the actions, operations or risk management programs of a BHC, an insured depository institution or their subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have the ability to take enforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank, respectively, to prevent and remedy acts and practices that the agencies determine to be unfair or deceptive. A finding that we have engaged in a deceptive act or practice may have collateral consequences on our ability to rely on certain exemptions in, or take advantage of certain provisions of, the securities laws absent a government waiver of such restrictions.\nMoreover, less than satisfactory examination ratings, lower capital or liquidity ratios than peer group institutions, or regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors can all potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, make capital distributions or continue to conduct existing activities. Furthermore, the OCC has established certain heightened risk management and governance standards for large national banks, including PNC Bank. The guidelines, among other things, establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework, describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, internal audit, and the board of directors, and provide that a covered bank should have a comprehensive written statement that articulates its risk appetite and serves as a basis for the framework. If the OCC determines that a covered national bank is not in compliance with these or other enforceable guidelines (including guidelines relating to information security standards), the OCC may require the bank to submit a corrective action plan and may initiate enforcement action against the bank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or the bank fails to comply with an approved plan.\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulation, Regulation W, place quantitative and qualitative restrictions on covered transactions between a bank and its affiliates (for example between PNC Bank, on the one hand, and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its non-bank subsidiaries, on the other hand). In general, Section 23A and Regulation W limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and any single affiliate to 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and all its affiliates to 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing low-quality assets from an affiliate and require certain covered transactions to be secured with prescribed amounts of collateral. Covered transactions include, among other things, extensions of credit, guarantees and purchases of assets. Section 23B generally requires that transactions between a bank and its affiliates be on terms that are at least as favorable to the bank as the terms that would apply in comparable transactions between the bank and a third party. Dodd-Frank amended Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include as a covered transaction the credit exposure of a bank to an affiliate arising from a derivative transaction with the affiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to propose rules to implement these revisions.\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve regulations also place quantitative limitations and conditions on extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders and their related interests (including any company controlled by such persons). Generally, extensions of credit by a bank to such individuals, companies and related interests must comply with certain individual and aggregate lending limits, as well as procedural and qualitative requirements. As a result of the amount of PNC common stock held by its advised mutual funds and other accounts, the Vanguard Group is considered a principal shareholder of PNC Bank for purposes of these regulations. The federal banking agencies have issued an interagency statement addressing the application of these insider lending restrictions to the other portfolio companies owned or controlled by the advised funds and accounts of a fund complex that could be considered a principal shareholder of a bank. The statement, which is currently in force until December 31, 2025, explains that the federal banking agencies will continue to exercise discretion to not take enforcement action against either a fund complex that is a principal shareholder of a bank, or a bank for which a fund complex is a principal shareholder, with respect to extensions of credit by the bank to the related interests of such fund complex that otherwise would violate the insider lending restrictions, subject to certain conditions.\nThe Federal Reserve is required to establish standards under a statutory provision known as the “Durbin Amendment” for assessing whether the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer such as PNC Bank is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer, subject to certain adjustments. The Federal Reserve implemented these standards through Regulation II, which limits the interchange fee an issuer may charge based on three components. On October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the three components of the interchange fee cap. We expect the proposed rule, if finalized in its current form, would reduce PNC Bank’s interchange fee revenue.\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided guidance regarding incentive and other elements of compensation provided to executives and other employees at banking organizations they regulate, both as general industry-wide guidance and guidance specific \n8\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nto select larger companies, including PNC. This guidance is intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of covered banking organizations do not encourage excessive risk-taking. Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC and two other regulatory agencies to adopt regulations governing incentive compensation provided by regulated financial services companies to their executives and other employees. These agencies jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement these requirements. Final regulations have not been adopted. \nThe trust, investment advisory and other fiduciary activities conducted by PNC Bank also are subject to the OCC’s regulations governing the fiduciary activities of national banks, as well as applicable state fiduciary laws. The OCC’s regulations, among other things, set standards for the administration of fiduciary accounts, prohibit or govern potential conflicts of interests and establish recordkeeping requirements for fiduciary accounts. \nThe Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or consolidate with any other BHC. In reviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or BHC, the factors the Federal Reserve must consider include (i) the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; (ii) the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; (iii) the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the U.S.; (iv) the organizations’ compliance with AML laws and regulations; (v) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and (vi) the records of performance under the CRA of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. \nThe Federal Reserve’s prior approval also is required, and similar factors are considered, for a BHC to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a savings association or savings and loan holding company, or to merge or consolidate with a savings and loan holding company. In cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. A BHC is generally prohibited from merging or consolidating with, or acquiring, another company or bank if upon consummation the resulting company would control 10% or more of deposits in the U.S. or a state, or if the resulting company’s liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate liabilities of the U.S. financial sector (including the U.S. liabilities of foreign financial companies). In extraordinary cases, the FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, could order the break-up of financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial stability of the U.S.\nOCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to acquire another insured bank or savings association by merger or to acquire deposits or substantially all of the assets of such institutions. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to those that must be considered by the Federal Reserve in connection with the acquisition of a bank or BHC. Approval of the OCC and the FDIC is required to merge a non-bank entity into PNC Bank. \nThe Federal Reserve also has issued rules governing when a BHC is presumed to “control” another company for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby causing the company to be considered a subsidiary for purposes of the BHC Act. The rules establish a set of presumptions identifying when a BHC would be deemed to control another company, with the nature and scope of relationships a BHC may have with a non-controlled company (\ne.g.\n, director or officer representatives, scope of business relationships, etc.) declining as the BHC’s voting ownership percentage in the company increases. \nFDIC Insurance and Related Matters\n. Deposits held by PNC Bank are insured by the FDIC, subject to certain limits, and subject to deposit premium assessments. PNC Bank, as an insured depository institution with over $50 billion in assets and controlled by a BHC with over $500 billion in assets on a consolidated basis, is a “highly complex institution” under the FDIC’s methodology for determining premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based.” Therefore, higher deposit premiums would be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the primary federal banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings of assets or liabilities classified as higher risk by the FDIC, including brokered deposits. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category.\nFollowing the bank failures in March 2023, the FDIC invoked the systemic risk exception to certain resolution-related and Deposit Insurance Fund restrictions in order to fully protect all depositors of the affected institutions, including uninsured deposits. By law, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception must be recovered by one or more special assessments on insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, or both. On November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to implement the special assessment. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect from PNC, along with other BHCs and insured depository institutions, special assessments at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points of an institution’s uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion), over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning after the first quarter of 2024. Because the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund from the systemic risk exception are \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n9\n \nestimated, the FDIC periodically adjusts the estimate, which could result in extending the special assessment for additional quarters, imposing a final special assessment on a one-time basis if actual losses exceed the amounts collected, or cease collection early if the FDIC has collected enough to recover actual losses. PNC incurred noninterest expenses related to the special assessment of $515 million on a pre-tax basis during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses. The fourth quarter of 2024 included an $18 million pre-tax reduction of the FDIC special assessment.\nFederal banking laws and regulations also apply a variety of requirements or restrictions on insured depository institutions with respect to brokered deposits. For instance, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, brokered deposits are generally subject to higher outflow assumptions than other types of deposits for purposes of the LCR. The FDIC has issued rules and guidance for determining whether deposits are considered “brokered.” \nResolution and Recovery Planning\n.\n BHCs that have $100 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, are required under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan (including a public summary) that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable resolution framework), and additionally could require the company to divest assets or take other actions if the company did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. PNC generally must file a resolution plan with the Federal Reserve and FDIC at least once each three-year period, with submissions alternating between a full plan and a plan targeted on certain areas or subjects identified by the agencies. The agencies, however, have reserved the ability to alter the scheduled filing date for a covered company, request an interim update before a covered company’s next scheduled filing date and require a covered company to submit a full resolution plan in lieu of a scheduled targeted plan. PNC filed a targeted resolution plan in December 2021 and received feedback from the agencies in December 2022 that did not identify any shortcomings or deficiencies in PNC’s plan. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized new guidance for holding company resolution plans submitted by domestic triennial full filers, such as PNC, under the Dodd-Frank Act. The guidance bifurcates each area of requirements into separate sections for single point of entry and multiple point of entry resolution strategies, generally applying—to the extent relevant to each resolution strategy—the expectations from the 2019 resolution plan guidance applicable to U.S. GSIBs. Firms like PNC with a multiple point of entry resolution strategy will be required to incorporate more severe plan assumptions and include new required plan content, operational capabilities, and legal entity rationalization, among other requirements. PNC’s next 165(d) resolution plan is due October 1, 2025, per an extension provided by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in finalizing the new guidance.  \nThe FDIC also requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, to periodically submit a resolution plan (including a public summary) to the FDIC that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the institution could be resolved under the FDI Act in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. PNC Bank filed its last resolution plan in December 2022. Under a final rule issued by the FDIC in June 2024, most banks with $100 billion or more in assets, including PNC Bank, are required to submit full resolution plans on a three-year cycle, with interim informational supplements due in off-years. The FDIC may also engage in capabilities testing between full resolution plan submissions. The final rule significantly expands the required content elements and adds virtual data room and valuation capabilities as significant components of the resolution planning process. PNC Bank’s initial interim supplement is due on or before July 1, 2025, and PNC Bank’s next full resolution plan will be due on or before July 1, 2026.\nPNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning. These guidelines require a covered bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that is evaluated and updated annually that, among other things, identifies a range of options that could be undertaken by the covered bank to restore its financial strength and viability should identified triggering events occur. The recovery plan guidelines are enforceable in the same manner as the other guidelines the OCC has established. In October 2024, the OCC finalized revisions to its recovery planning guidelines. The final guidelines incorporate an annual testing requirement into recovery plans and will require covered banks to consider both financial risks and non-financial risks—including operational and strategic risks—in their recovery plans. The guidance is effective as of January 1, 2025, except that covered banks, like PNC Bank, should be in compliance with the amended provisions addressing non-financial risk by January 1, 2026, and with the testing provisions by June 30, 2026. \nCFPB Regulation and Supervision\n. The CFPB is authorized to examine PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to deposit products, credit card, mortgage, automobile, student and other consumer loans, and other consumer financial products and services that we offer. The consumer financial protection laws that are subject to the CFPB’s supervision and enforcement powers include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. \n10\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nThe CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, and to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service.\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact products and services offered by PNC or PNC Bank. The CFPB has engaged in rulemakings that affect, among other things, credit card late fees, overdraft fees, data collection and reporting requirements for small business lenders such as PNC Bank, and personal financial data rights. In early February 2025, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed CFPB staff to, among other things, cease supervision and examination activities, pause pending investigation and enforcement actions, and not approve or issue any proposed or final rules. At this time, it is unclear how long these instructions will stay in force, either fully or partially.\nSecurities and Derivatives Regulation\nPNC, as a public company, is subject to the Exchange Act’s reporting requirements and related regulations and must file certain reports with the SEC on an ongoing basis. Our registered broker-dealers and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to the Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, respectively, and related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These rules, for example, require that broker-dealers and investment advisers act in a customer’s best interest when making investment recommendations to retail customers, which includes managing conflicts of interest, providing required disclosures and exercising a duty of care in making investment recommendations. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory organization for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations also can affect our ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\nThe CFTC regulates swap dealers, other than security-based swap dealers, which are regulated by the SEC. PNC Bank is registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC. Because of the limited volume of our security-based swap dealing activities, PNC Bank has not registered (and currently does not intend, and is not required, to register) with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\nPNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses are subject to the regulations and requirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap dealers, and the CFTC (and for certain delegated responsibilities, the National Futures Association) has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. The CFTC’s regulations are intended to (i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives and foreign exchange markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures and protections to customers and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, these regulations (i) require that, absent certain specified exemptions, most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and be traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (ii) subject PNC Bank to comprehensive recordkeeping, regulatory reporting and real-time public reporting requirements; (iii) subject PNC Bank to various business conduct requirements, including the provision of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks, material incentives and any conflicts of interest associated with their swap; and (iv) impose special duties on PNC Bank when transacting a swap with a “special entity” (\ne.g.\n, governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment). Because PNC Bank is a prudentially regulated swap dealer, PNC Bank is subject to the OCC’s capital requirements and margin requirements on certain swaps that are not centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house.\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to PNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC swap dealer, impose compliance burdens on PNC Bank and introduce additional legal risks (including as a result of applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). In addition, failure to comply with the “pay-to-play” regulations that govern our swap and municipal securities businesses could result in limitations on PNC Bank’s ability to conduct swap and municipal securities business with state or local governments and their authorities.\nRegulations of Other Agencies\nIn addition to regulations issued by the federal banking, securities and derivatives regulators, we also are subject to regulations issued by other federal agencies with respect to certain financial products and services we offer. For example, certain of our fiduciary, brokerage and investment management activities are subject to regulations issued by the Department of Labor under ERISA and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n11\n \nCompetition\nWe are subject to intense competition from other regulated banking organizations, as well as various other types of financial institutions and non-bank entities that can offer a number of similar products and services without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.\nOur businesses compete to attract and retain deposits and/or to originate loans with:\n•\nOther commercial banks,\n•\nSavings banks,\n•\nCredit unions,\n•\nConsumer finance companies,\n•\nLeasing companies,\n•\nInvestment management firms,\n•\nOther non-bank lenders,\n•\nFinancial technology companies,\n•\nTreasury management service companies,\n•\nInsurance companies, and\n•\nIssuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual funds.\nIn providing asset management services, our businesses compete with:\n•\nInvestment management firms,\n•\nLarge banks and other financial institutions,\n•\nBrokerage firms,\n•\nFinancial technology companies,\n•\nMutual fund complexes, and\n•\nInsurance companies.\nOur various non-bank businesses engaged in investment banking and alternative investment activities compete with:\n•\nCommercial banks,\n•\nInvestment banking firms,\n•\nCollateralized loan obligation managers,\n•\nHedge funds,\n•\nMutual fund complexes,\n•\nMerchant banks,\n•\nInsurance companies,\n•\nPrivate equity firms, and\n•\nOther investment vehicles.\nCompetition is based on a number of factors including pricing, product structure, the range of products and services offered and the quality of customer service. Loan pricing, structure and credit standards are extremely important as we seek to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Deposit-taking activities are also subject to pricing pressures and to customer migration as a result of intense competition for deposits and investments. Competitors may seek to compete with us through traditional channels such as physical locations or through digital channels such as the internet or mobile applications. We include here by reference the additional information regarding competition and factors affecting our competitive position included in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nHuman Capital\nWe place great importance on having the right people in the right roles, with the right skills, and doing their best work. By focusing on the growth and development of our talented team members, we believe we are best positioned to deliver results for our customers. We believe when our employees deliver for our customers, they deliver for our communities and shareholders as well.\nPNC devotes substantial resources to managing and developing human capital. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of our human capital management strategies, programs and policies developed by our Chief Human Resources Officer and senior management team and is assisted by our Board’s Nominating and Governance and Human Resources Committees. Our Management Executive Committee assists and makes recommendations to our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors on human capital matters.\nThe Board of Directors also includes a Corporate Responsibility Committee, which assists the Board in its oversight of management’s corporate responsibility efforts which are led by the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer. The Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer is a member of the Executive Committee, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors provides \n12\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nformal oversight of PNC’s corporate responsibility strategy and regularly reviews policies, programs and strategies foundational to the work of the corporate responsibility department. \nAdditionally, our Corporate Diversity Council is co-chaired by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Diversity Officer and includes senior leaders from across the organization. The council is responsible for overseeing strategic corporate initiatives that impact the creation and sustainment of an inclusive corporate culture and a talented workforce that is best positioned to serve our diverse customer base.\nEmployees totaled 55,184 at December 31, 2024. This total included 53,686 full-time and 1,498 part-time employees, of which 27,513 full-time and 1,451 part-time employees were employed in our Retail Banking business. \nPart of PNC’s ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and retain and develop our existing employees. In support of our employees, our human capital strategies include:\n•\nAdvancing PNC’s talent-focused culture by developing strong leaders who exemplify our Leadership Standards, a set of standards designed to hold managers accountable for living our corporate values, enabling change, achieving results, fostering inclusion and developing the best talent and providing them with the tools and insights to effectively manage our people.\n•\nFocusing on the development and retention of high performing talent with the relevant experiences, skills and perspectives to best support the diverse group of individuals, families and businesses that we serve across the country.\n•\nSupporting all employees with opportunities for professional growth, career mobility and health and financial wellness.\n•\nFostering an accessible and inclusive workplace where all employees and customers can feel welcome, valued and respected.\n•\nSupporting a strong ethical culture anchored in our corporate values and doing the right thing for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders.\nIn managing our employees, we focus on these key factors:\n•\nRecruiting, developing and retaining talent\n. We believe recruiting, developing and retaining talent starts with our leaders, and we measure our managers against our Leadership Standards. Our talent priority is to invest in the development of our internal talent and to provide career advancement opportunities to our employees. We measure how many open requisitions we fill with internal candidates, participation in early career development programs and turnover. At our first-level and above career bands we fill approximately 60% of our open requisitions with internal candidates, which has a direct impact on our ability to retain and develop our people. In addition, we hire approximately 500 interns and 400 full-time development program associates each year from our 11 early career development programs that support each of our lines of business and support areas.\n•\nDiversity and inclusion\n. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining a workforce that reflects and is equipped to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. In compliance with government requirements and, in some cases, based on employee self-disclosure, we gather information related to the composition of our workforce. The racial, ethnic and gender composition of our workforce, including within our executive, senior leader and other managerial roles, is reflected in our EEO-1 reports, which are posted on our website.\n•\nTotal rewards\n. We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits programs as part of our overall strategy to retain and recruit talent. We design our compensation and benefits programs to focus on three key aspects of employee well-being: health, money and quality of life. These programs include competitive base salaries and, depending on eligibility, cash incentive and/or stock-based award opportunities, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan with employer match, a pension plan, healthcare, life insurance and disability benefits, health savings and dependent care flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid maternity and parental leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, a robust wellness program with incentives, family building benefits, employee assistance programs and educational assistance, among others. Additionally, we conduct pay equity analyses to determine if employees are being compensated fairly and consistently across roles.\n•\nEmployee engagement\n. PNC regularly conducts employee surveys to measure employee engagement because we believe that engaged employees have lower attrition rates and improved customer outcomes.\nClimate Change Strategy\nWe recognize that environmental issues, such as climate change, could pose financial, legal and reputational risk to PNC. We strive to manage our physical footprint in a sustainable manner, incorporating climate-related risk considerations into our ERM framework, maintaining portfolio management capabilities to implement purpose-driven strategies at clients’ requests, and helping clients finance their own sustainability goals. These tenets have been incorporated into our Climate Action Strategy that was formalized at the start of 2022 to enable us to support our clients by financing their transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n13\n \nOur governance of climate issues seeks to ensure an appropriate balancing of environmental considerations with other organizational priorities as we pursue our purpose of helping all of our stakeholders move forward financially. The Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of PNC’s strategy, including the risks and opportunities flowing from the environmental, social and governance issues material to PNC’s business. The full Board oversees such matters directly, informed by each committees’ oversight of the corporate responsibility matters within its purview, as set forth in its charter. Given the highly integrated nature of environmental concerns, including significant climate change issues, the full Board oversees these matters as informed by insights from its committees. In addition, we have an established risk management framework that helps identify, assess, monitor and report on environmental risks, including those related to climate change. PNC’s Climate Risk Committee specifically oversees the integration of climate-related risks into the ERM Framework. \nWe assess climate change risks under two distinct categories: physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks arise from risks associated with natural perils, such as hurricanes, fires, floods and drought. Physical risks may increase due to a changing climate, and we believe such increased risks are realized to a greater degree in the medium- to long-term. Transition risks are experienced as, and to the extent, the world moves toward a low-carbon economy. They can be reputational in nature or driven by changes in the market, technology and/or policy. Because transition risks are typically experienced to a greater degree in the short- to medium-term, they are dependent upon near-term policy decisions. Transition and physical risks each require a different risk management approach, and we explore a range of possible outcomes to gain insight on how to best manage these risks.\nFor more information on PNC’s climate change-related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors and the Credit Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nFinancial Information\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, we file annual,\nquarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

  "item7": "ITEM 7 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nE\nXECUTIVE \nS\nUMMARY\nKey Strategic Goals\nAt PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our commitments to our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities where we do business. \nWe strive to serve our customers and expand and deepen relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, credit and fee-based products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services to our customers with the goal of addressing their financial objectives and needs. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers’ financial goals and offering our diverse products and services to help them achieve financial well-being. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures.\nWe are focused on our strategic priorities, which are designed to enhance value over the long term, and consist of:\n•\nExpanding our leading banking franchise to new markets and digital platforms,\n•\nDeepening customer relationships by delivering a superior banking experience and financial solutions, and\n•\nLeveraging technology to create efficiencies that help us better serve customers.\nOur capital and liquidity priorities are to support customers, fund business investments and return excess capital to shareholders, while maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity in light of economic conditions, the Basel III framework and other regulatory expectations. For more detail, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business, the Capital Highlights portion of this Executive Summary and the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 7.\nKey Factors Affecting Financial Performance\nWe face a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current business and economic conditions, political and regulatory environment and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this Report.\nOur success will depend upon, among other things, the following factors that we manage or control:\n•\nEffectively managing capital and liquidity including:\n•\nContinuing to maintain and, over time, grow our deposit base as a low-cost stable funding source,\n•\nPrudent liquidity and capital management to meet evolving regulatory capital, capital planning, stress testing and liquidity standards, and\n•\nActions we take within the capital and other financial markets,\n•\nExecution of our strategic priorities,\n•\nManagement of credit risk in our portfolio,\n•\nOur ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment,\n•\nThe impact of legal and regulatory-related contingencies,\n•\nThe appropriateness of critical accounting estimates and related contingencies, and \n•\nOur ability to manage operational risks related to new products and services, changes in processes and procedures or the implementation of new technology.\nOur financial performance is also substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following:\n•\nGlobal and domestic economic conditions, \n•\nThe actions by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates and inflation,\n•\nThe level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve,\n•\nThe functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, U.S. and global financial markets,\n•\nThe impact of tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n•\nChanges in the competitive landscape,\n•\nImpacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,\n•\nThe impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations,\n•\nThe ability of customers, counterparties and issuers to perform in accordance with contractual terms,\n•\nThe effect of climate change on our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers,\n36\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n•\nLoan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and\n•\nThe impact on customers and changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or regulatory or legislative initiatives.\nFor additional information on the risks we face, see Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Item 7.\nSignature Bank Portfolio Acquisition\nOn October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately $16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition. \nWorkforce Reduction\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, PNC implemented a workforce reduction that was expected to reduce 2024 personnel expense by approximately $325 million annually, on a pre-tax basis. PNC incurred expenses of $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with this workforce reduction.\nFDIC Special Assessment\nIn November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. As a result, PNC incurred a pre-tax expense of $515 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses. The fourth quarter of 2024 included an $18 million pre-tax reduction of the FDIC special assessment. \nSecond Quarter 2024 Significant Items\nIn the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1 common\nshares into approximately equal amounts of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. This conversion event\nresulted in a gain of $754 million related to the Visa Class C common shares received. PNC retained the Visa Class B-2 common\nshares. The second quarter of 2024 also included Visa Class B-2 derivative fair value adjustments of negative $116 million and a $120\nmillion expense related to a PNC Foundation contribution. During the second quarter, PNC also repositioned the investment securities\nportfolio, selling low-yielding investment securities for net proceeds of $3.8 billion, resulting in a loss of $497 million. PNC\nredeployed the full proceeds from the sale into higher-yielding investment securities. The combined impact of all of these significant items on pre-tax noninterest income and pre-tax noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2024 was $141 million and $120 million, respectively.\nHurricanes Helene and Milton\nDuring September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida’s panhandle, impacting a large region of the\nsoutheastern United States, including the southern Appalachians. In October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall\non the central west coast of Florida, causing widespread damage across the state. The storms resulted in property damage to our\ncustomers, the closing or disruption of many businesses, including some of PNC’s branches and facilities and damage to the\ncommunity infrastructure. We evaluated the impact to our businesses, and, based on our assessments to date, these storms did not have a material impact on our operating results, including credit losses.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n37\n \nSelected Financial Data\nThe following tables include selected financial data which should be reviewed in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Report as well as the other disclosures in this Report concerning our historical financial performance, our future prospects and the risks associated with our business and financial performance.\nTable 1: Summary of Operations, Per Common Share Data and Performance Ratios\n \nYear ended December 31\nDollars in millions, except per share data\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSummary of Operations\nNet interest income\n$\n13,499 \n$\n13,916 \n$\n13,014 \nNoninterest income\n8,056 \n7,574 \n8,106 \nTotal revenue\n21,555 \n21,490 \n21,120 \nProvision for credit losses\n789 \n742 \n477 \nNoninterest expense\n13,524 \n14,012 \n13,170 \nIncome before income taxes and noncontrolling interests\n7,242 \n6,736 \n7,473 \nIncome taxes\n1,289 \n1,089 \n1,360 \nNet income\n$\n5,953 \n$\n5,647 \n$\n6,113 \nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n5,529 \n$\n5,153 \n$\n5,735 \nPer Common Share\nDiluted earnings\n$\n13.74 \n$\n12.79 \n$\n13.85 \nBook value per common share\n$\n122.94 \n$\n112.72 \n$\n99.93 \nTangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) (a) \n$\n95.33 \n$\n85.08 \n$\n72.12 \nPerformance Ratios\nNet interest margin (non-GAAP) (b)\n2.66 \n%\n2.76 \n%\n2.65 \n%\nNoninterest income to total revenue\n37 \n%\n35 \n%\n38 \n%\nEfficiency\n63 \n%\n65 \n%\n62 \n%\nReturn on:\n   Average common shareholders’ equity\n11.92 \n%\n12.35 \n%\n13.52 \n%\n   Average assets\n1.05 \n%\n1.01 \n%\n1.11 \n%\n(a)\nSee explanation and reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure in the Non-GAAP Financial Information section of this Item 7.\n(b)\nSee explanation and reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure in the Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis and Non-GAAP Financial Information sections of this Item 7.\nTable 2: Balance Sheet Highlights and Other Selected Ratios\n \nDecember 31\nDollars in millions, except as noted\n2024\n2023\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAssets\n$\n560,038 \n$\n561,580 \nLoans \n$\n316,467 \n$\n321,508 \nAllowance for loan and lease losses \n$\n4,486 \n$\n4,791 \nInterest-earning deposits with banks\n$\n39,347 \n$\n43,804 \nInvestment securities\n$\n139,732 \n$\n132,569 \nTotal deposits\n$\n426,738 \n$\n421,418 \nBorrowed funds\n$\n61,673 \n$\n72,737 \nTotal shareholders’ equity\n$\n54,425 \n$\n51,105 \nCommon shareholders’ equity\n$\n48,676 \n$\n44,864 \nOther Selected Ratios\nCommon equity Tier 1\n10.5 \n%\n9.9 \n%\nDividend payout\n45.9 \n%\n47.8 \n%\nLoans to deposits\n74 \n%\n76 \n%\nCommon shareholders’ equity to total assets\n8.7 \n%\n8.0 \n%\nAverage common shareholders’ equity to average assets\n8.2 \n%\n7.5 \n%\n38\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nIncome Statement Highlights\nNet income for 2024 was $6.0 billion or $13.74 per diluted common share, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 5%, compared to net income of $5.6 billion, or $12.79 per diluted common share, for 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower noninterest expense and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income. \n•\nTotal revenue was stable at $21.6 billion.\n•\nNet interest income decreased $0.4 billion, or 3%, to $13.5 billion as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields and balances was more than offset by increased funding costs. \n•\nNet interest margin decreased to 2.66% for 2024 compared to 2.76% for 2023.\n•\nNoninterest income increased $0.5 billion, or 6%, to $8.1 billion primarily driven by higher capital markets and advisory fees. \n•\nProvision for credit losses was $789 million in 2024 reflecting the impact of net charge-offs, primarily in our commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and credit card loan classes, and a net decline in the ACL due to improved macroeconomic factors and portfolio activity. Provision for credit losses was $742 million in 2023.\n•\nNoninterest expense decreased $488 million, or 3%, to $13.5 billion compared to 2023 reflecting lower costs related to the FDIC’s special assessment and lower personnel expense, partially offset by a PNC Foundation contribution expense of $120 million in the second quarter of 2024 and impairments of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily related to technology investments. Costs related to the FDIC special assessment were $112 million in 2024 compared to $515 million in 2023. Noninterest expense in 2023 also included $150 million of workforce reduction charges.\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nOur balance sheet was well positioned at December 31, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:\n•\nTotal assets were stable and included higher securities balances, partially offset by lower loans outstanding and lower balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank.\n•\nTotal loans decreased $5.0 billion, or 2%, to $316.5 billion.\n•\nTotal commercial loans decreased $3.4 billion, or 2%, to $216.2 billion, due to lower utilization of loan commitments and commercial real estate paydowns.\n•\nTotal consumer loans decreased $1.6 billion, or 2%, to $100.3 billion, as growth in automobile loans was more than offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced originations.\n•\nInvestment securities increased $7.2 billion, or 5%, to $139.7 billion, due to increased purchase activity, primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.\n•\nInterest earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased $4.5 billion, or 10%, to $39.3 billion, primarily due to lower borrowed funds and higher securities balances, partially offset by higher deposits and lower loan balances.\n•\nTotal deposits increased $5.3 billion, or 1%, to $426.7 billion, reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits increased due to higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances.\n•\nBorrowed funds of $61.7 billion decreased $11.1 billion, or 15%, due to lower FHLB advances, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances.\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7.\nCredit Quality Highlights \n2024 reflected strong credit quality performance.\n•\nAt December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023:\n•\nOverall loan delinquencies of $1.4 billion were stable.\n•\nThe ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments, totaled $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The reserve change was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. ACL to total loans was 1.64% and 1.70% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n•\nNonperforming assets of $2.4 billion increased $141 million, or 6%, primarily due to higher commercial real estate nonperforming loans.\n•\nNet charge-offs of $1.0 billion or 0.33% of average loans in 2024 increased $331 million compared to net charge-offs of $710 million or 0.22% of average loans for 2023, reflecting higher commercial and consumer net loan charge-offs.\nFor additional detail, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n39\n \nCapital and Liquidity Highlights\nWe maintained strong capital and liquidity positions during 2024.\n•\nCommon shareholders’ equity increased $3.8 billion to $48.7 billion at December 31, 2024, due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by common dividends paid and common share repurchases.\n•\nIn 2024, we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $2.5 billion and repurchases of 3.5 million common shares for $0.6 billion.\n•\nPNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%. See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 and the  Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 for more details on the SCB and our common shares still available for repurchase.\n•\nOn January 3, 2025, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.60 per share to be paid on February 5, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business January 15, 2025.\n•\nThe Basel III CET1 capital ratio increased to 10.5% at December 31, 2024 from 9.9% at December 31, 2023.\n•\nPNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC entered a three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard was phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, CECL will be fully reflected in regulatory capital. The estimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was 10.5% at December 31, 2024 compared to 9.8% at December 31, 2023.\nPNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. See additional discussion of the CCAR process in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 for more detail on our 2024 capital and liquidity actions as well as our capital ratios.\n \nBusiness Outlook \nStatements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject, among other things, to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views that: \n•\nThe labor market remains strong, and job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth in the near term. PNC’s baseline forecast is for continued expansion, but slower economic growth in 2025 than in 2024. High interest rates remain a drag on the economy, consumer spending growth will slow to a pace more consistent with household income growth, and government’s contribution to economic growth will be smaller.\n•\nReal GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 will be approximately 2%, and the unemployment rate will remain somewhat above 4% throughout 2025 and into 2026. There will be little progress on inflation in 2025; wage pressures will abate, but higher tariffs will offset this, and inflation will remain above the Federal Reserve’s 2% objective throughout 2025.\n•\nLittle progress on inflation this year will limit monetary easing. PNC expects two additional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2025, one in May and one in July. The federal funds rate will be in a range between 3.75% and 4.00% in the second half of 2025, and remain in that range into 2026.\nSee Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Item 7 for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nFor the full year 2025, compared to full year 2024, we expect:\n•\nAverage loans to be stable,\n•\nSpot loans to be up 2% to 3%,\n•\nNet interest income to be up 6% to 7%,\n•\nNoninterest income to be up approximately 5%,\n•\nRevenue to be up approximately 6%, \n•\nNoninterest expense to be up approximately 1%, and\n•\nThe effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nFor the first quarter of 2025, compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect:\n•\nAverage loans to be down approximately 1%,\n•\nNet interest income to be down 2% to 3%, \n•\nFee income to be stable,\n40\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n•\nOther noninterest income to be between $150 million and $200 million,\n•\nRevenue to be down 1% to 2%,\n•\nNoninterest expense to be down 2% to 3%, and\n•\nNet loan charge-offs to be approximately $300 million.\nNoninterest income, other noninterest income and revenue guidance does not forecast net securities gains or losses or Visa activity.\nWe are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, without unreasonable effort, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amounts necessary for the reconciliation when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information.\nC\nONSOLIDATED\n I\nNCOME\n S\nTATEMENT\n R\nEVIEW\nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report. For the comparison of 2023 over 2022, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section in our 2023 Form 10-K. \nNet income for 2024 was $6.0 billion, or $13.74 per diluted common share, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 5%, compared to net income of $5.6 billion, or $12.79 per diluted common share, for 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower noninterest expense and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income. \nNet Interest Income\nTable 3: Summarized Average Balances and Net Interest Income (a)\n \n2024\n2023\nYear ended December 31\nDollars in millions\nAverage\nBalances\nAverage\nYields/\nRates\nInterest\nIncome/\nExpense\nAverage\nBalances\nAverage\nYields/\nRates\nInterest\nIncome/\nExpense\nAssets\nInterest-earning assets\nInvestment securities\n$\n140,742 \n2.94 \n%\n$\n4,144 \n$\n140,351 \n2.54 \n%\n$\n3,568 \nLoans\n319,794 \n6.08 \n%\n19,456 \n323,520 \n5.69 \n%\n18,423 \nInterest-earning deposits with banks\n43,145 \n5.34 \n%\n2,303 \n36,645 \n5.19 \n%\n1,902 \nOther\n9,135 \n6.70 \n%\n612 \n8,884 \n6.33 \n%\n562 \nTotal interest-earning assets/interest income\n$\n512,816 \n5.17 \n%\n26,515 \n$\n509,400 \n4.80 \n%\n24,455 \nLiabilities\nInterest-bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing deposits\n$\n324,435 \n2.59 \n%\n8,401 \n$\n315,393 \n2.10 \n%\n6,609 \nBorrowed funds\n74,061 \n6.05 \n%\n4,484 \n67,282 \n5.62 \n%\n3,783 \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities/interest expense\n$\n398,496 \n3.23 \n%\n12,885 \n$\n382,675 \n2.72 \n%\n10,392 \nNet interest margin/income (non-GAAP)\n2.66 \n%\n13,630 \n2.76 \n%\n14,063 \nTaxable-equivalent adjustments\n(131)\n(147)\nNet interest income (GAAP)\n \n \n$\n13,499 \n \n \n$\n13,916 \n(a)\nInterest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see the Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) of  this Item 7.\nChanges in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis section of this Item 7 for additional information.\nNet interest income decreased $0.4 billion, or 3%, and net interest margin decreased 10 basis points in 2024 compared with 2023 as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields and balances were more than offset by increased funding costs. \nAverage investment securities were stable as net purchase activity of available-for-sale securities was offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities of held-to-maturity securities. Average investment securities represented 27% of average interest-earning assets in 2024 compared to 28% in 2023.\nAverage loans decreased $3.7 billion, or 1%, primarily due to lower average utilization of commercial loan commitments.

In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 81% of average interest-bearing liabilities in 2024 compared to 82% in 2023.\nAverage borrowed funds increased $6.8 billion, or 10%, primarily due to parent company senior debt issuances, partially offset by lower FHLB advances. \nFurther details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 4: Noninterest Income\nYear ended December 31\n  \n  \nChange\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nNoninterest income\nAsset management and brokerage\n$\n1,485 \n$\n1,412 \n$\n73 \n5 \n%\nCapital markets and advisory\n1,250 \n952 \n298 \n31 \n%\nCard and cash management\n2,770 \n2,733 \n37 \n1 \n%\nLending and deposit services\n1,259 \n1,233 \n26 \n2 \n%\nResidential and commercial mortgage\n581 \n625 \n(44)\n(7)\n%\nOther income\nGain on Visa shares exchange program\n754 \n \n754 \n*\nSecurities gains (losses)\n(500)\n(2)\n(498)\n*\nOther\n457 \n621 \n(164)\n(26)\n%\nTotal other income\n711 \n619 \n92 \n15 \n%\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n8,056 \n$\n7,574 \n$\n482 \n6 \n%\n \n*- Not Meaningful \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 37% for 2024 and 35% for 2023.\nAsset management and brokerage fees\n increased reflecting the impact of higher average equity markets as well as higher annuity sales.  PNC’s discretionary client assets under management increased to $211 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $189 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher spot equity markets. Capital markets and advisory fees increased primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity and increased underwriting fees. Card and cash management revenue growth was driven by higher treasury management product revenue. Lending and deposit services grew as a result of increased customer activity. Residential and commercial mortgage decreased due to lower residential mortgage banking activities. Other noninterest income increased compared to 2023 driven by the benefit of significant items in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower private equity revenue. \nFurther details regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7.

Costs related to the FDIC special assessment were $112 million in 2024 compared to $515 million in 2023. Noninterest expense in 2023 also included $150 million of workforce reduction charges.\nWe exceeded our 2024 continuous improvement program savings goal of $450 million. In 2025, our continuous improvement program goal will be $350 million.\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nThe effective income tax rate was 17.8% for 2024 compared with 16.2% for 2023.\nThe effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive from our investments in low- income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings on other tax exempt investments.

The sale of these securities resulted in a loss of $497 million. We deployed the sale proceeds into available-for-sale securities with a weighted average yield of approximately 5.5%.\nThe level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.\nTable 9: Investment Securities (a) \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDollars in millions\nAmortized\nCost (b)\nFair\nValue\nAmortized\nCost (b)\nFair\nValue\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\n$\n53,382 \n$\n52,075 \n$\n44,125 \n$\n42,348 \nAgency residential mortgage-backed\n73,760 \n67,117 \n73,329 \n67,925 \nNon-agency residential mortgage-backed\n744 \n822 \n844 \n938 \nAgency commercial mortgage-backed\n3,032 \n2,875 \n2,619 \n2,471 \nNon-agency commercial mortgage-backed (c)\n1,542 \n1,523 \n2,286 \n2,217 \nAsset-backed (d)\n5,733 \n5,793 \n6,982 \n6,984 \nOther debt (e)\n4,998 \n4,892 \n5,952 \n5,850 \nTotal investment securities (f)\n$\n143,191 \n$\n135,097 \n$\n136,137 \n$\n128,733 \n(a)\nOf our total securities portfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(b)\nAmortized cost is presented net of the allowance for investment securities, which totaled $91 million at December 31, 2024 and primarily related to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities.

The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at December 31, 2024 primarily reflected the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of fixed-rate securities. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional details regarding the allowance for investment securities.\nThe duration of investment securities was 3.5 years and 4.2 years at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We estimate that at December 31, 2024 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.4 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 3.5 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.1 years and 4.2 years, respectively.\nBased on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.3 years at December 31, 2024 compared to 5.5 years at December 31, 2023.\nTable 10: Weighted-Average Expected Maturities of Mortgage and Asset-Backed Debt Securities\nDecember 31, 2024\nYears\nAgency residential mortgage-backed\n6.9 \nNon-agency residential mortgage-backed\n10.3 \nAgency commercial mortgage-backed\n4.1 \nNon-agency commercial mortgage-backed\n0.6 \nAsset-backed\n2.2 \nAdditional information regarding our investment securities portfolio is included in Note 2 Investment Securities and Note 14 Fair Value.\nFunding Sources\nTable 11: Details of Funding Sources  \nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nChange\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nDeposits\n \n \n \n \nNoninterest-bearing\n$\n92,641 \n$\n101,285 \n$\n(8,644)\n(9)\n%\nInterest-bearing\nMoney market\n73,801 \n65,594 \n8,207 \n13 \n%\nDemand\n128,810 \n124,848 \n3,962 \n3 \n%\nSavings\n97,147 \n98,122 \n(975)\n(1)\n%\nTime deposits\n34,339 \n31,569 \n2,770 \n9 \n%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n334,097 \n320,133 \n13,964 \n4 \n%\nTotal deposits\n426,738 \n421,418 \n5,320 \n1 \n%\nBorrowed funds\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances\n22,000 \n38,000 \n(16,000)\n(42)\n%\nSenior debt\n32,497 \n26,836 \n5,661 \n21 \n%\nSubordinated debt\n4,104 \n4,875 \n(771)\n(16)\n%\nOther\n3,072 \n3,026 \n46 \n2 \n%\nTotal borrowed funds\n61,673 \n72,737 \n(11,064)\n(15)\n%\nTotal funding sources\n$\n488,411 \n$\n494,155 \n$\n(5,744)\n(1)\n%\nDeposits are considered an attractive source of funding due to their stability and relatively low cost to fund. Compared to December 31, 2023, our funding source composition included lower borrowed funds and higher deposit balances.\nTotal deposits increased reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits increased due to higher commercial balances partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances. This shift in deposit composition contributed to an increase in funding costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Our total brokered deposit balances of $7.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and $11.0 billion at December 31, 2023, were significantly below both our internal and regulatory guidelines and limits.\nBorrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB advances, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances.\n46\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nThe level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, capital considerations, and funding needs, which are primarily driven by changes in loan, deposit and investment securities balances.

Average loans for this business declined driven by paydowns outpacing new production and lower average utilization of loan commitments.\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits were stable in 2024 compared to 2023, as growth in interest-bearing deposits was mostly offset a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics. \nProduct Revenue\nIn addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses where the customer relationships exist. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.\nThe Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and disbursement management services, funds transfer services, international payment services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management customer deposit balances. Compared with 2023, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher product revenue.\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison primarily due to higher commercial mortgage loan servicing income.\nCapital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The increase in capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was mostly driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, higher underwriting fees and an increase in loan syndication fees, partially offset by lower customer-related interest rate derivative trading revenue.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n53\n \nAsset Management Group\nThe Asset Management Group strives to be a leading relationship-based provider of investment, planning, credit and cash management solutions and fiduciary services to affluent individuals and institutions by endeavoring to proactively deliver value-added ideas, solutions and exceptional service.

Accordingly, we design our risk governance framework, referred to as the ERM Framework, and risk management processes to help manage this risk. We manage risk in light of our risk appetite to optimize long-term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers and communities.\nOur ERM Framework is structurally aligned with regulatory enhanced prudential standards and heightened standards promulgated by the Federal Reserve and OCC, respectively, which establish minimum requirements for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework. This Risk Management section describes our ERM Framework, which consists of seven core components that provide executive management and the Board of Directors with an aggregate view of significant risks impacting the organization. The seven core components are risk culture, enterprise strategy (including risk appetite, strategic planning, capital and liquidity planning and stress testing), risk governance and oversight, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting (see the figure below). The overall Risk Management section of this Item 7 also provides an analysis of the firm’s Capital Management and our key areas of risk, which include, but are not limited to Credit, Market, Liquidity and Operational (including Compliance and Information Security). Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within this Risk Management section.\nWe operate within a rapidly evolving regulatory and financial services environment. Accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely incorporation of applicable regulatory pronouncements and emerging risks into our ERM Framework.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n55\n \nRisk Culture\nA strong risk culture helps us make well informed decisions, helps ensure individuals conform to the established culture, reduces an individual’s ability to do something for personal gain, and rewards employees for working toward a common goal rather than individual interests. Our risk culture reinforces the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior. These protocols are especially critical in terms of our risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and risk management practices.\nManaging risk is every employee’s responsibility. All of our employees, individually and collectively, are responsible for ensuring the organization is performing with the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management practices and is striving to achieve our stated objectives. All employees are also responsible for understanding our Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM Framework and how risk management applies to their respective roles and responsibilities. Employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. We reinforce risk management responsibilities through a performance management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to reinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.\nProactive and open communication, between groups and up to the Board of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of risk issues. Our multi-level risk committee structure provides formal channels to identify and report risk.\nEnterprise Strategy\nWe seek to ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within acceptable risk parameters through our risk appetite, strategic planning, capital and liquidity planning and stress testing processes. These components are reviewed and approved at least annually by the Board of Directors or one of its committees.\nRisk Appetite\n: Our risk appetite represents the organization’s desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital-based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. The Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement qualitatively describes the aggregate level of risk we are willing to accept in order to execute our business strategies. Qualitative guiding principles further define each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. Risk appetite metrics and limits, including forward-looking metrics, quantitatively measure whether we are operating within our stated risk appetite. Our risk appetite metrics reflect material risks, align with our established Risk Appetite Framework, balance risk and reward, leverage analytics, and are adjusted periodically based on changes in the external and internal risk environments.\nStrategic Planning\n: Our enterprise and line of business strategic plans outline major objectives, strategies and goals which are expected to be achieved over the next five years while seeking to ensure we remain compliant with all capital, risk appetite and liquidity targets and guidelines. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer lead the development of the corporate strategic plan.\nCapital and Liquidity Planning and Stress Testing\n: Capital and liquidity planning helps to ensure we are maintaining safe and sound operations and viability. The planning processes and the resulting plans evolve as our overall risks, activities and risk management practices change. Additionally, both plans must align with our strategic planning process. Stress testing is an essential element of the capital planning and liquidity risk management processes. Effective stress testing enables us to consider the estimated effect on the firm’s capital and liquidity positions across various hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios.\n56\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nRisk Governance and Oversight\nWe employ a comprehensive risk management governance framework to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced decisions are made that consider risk and return, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. Risk committees established within this risk governance and oversight framework provide oversight for risk management activities at the Board of Directors, executive, corporate and business levels. Committee composition is designed to provide effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense in accordance with the OCC’s heightened standards and the Federal Reserve Board’s enhanced prudential standards. See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report for more information.\nTo help ensure appropriate risks are being taken and effectively managed and controlled, risk is managed across three lines of defense. A summary of the Board of Directors’ and each line of defense’s responsibilities is provided below:\nBoard of Directors –\n The Board of Directors oversees our risk-taking activities, holds management accountable for adhering to the ERM Framework and is responsible for exercising sound, independent judgment when assessing risk.\nFirst line of defense\n – The front line units are accountable for identifying, owning and managing risks to within acceptable levels while adhering to the ERM Framework. Our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes within their areas. Integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately manage the business’ risk profile and risk appetite through identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting risks that may significantly impact each business.\nSecond line of defense –\n The second line of defense is independent from the first line of defense and is responsible for establishing the risk governance framework and the standards within each independent risk area for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting aggregate risks. As the second line of defense, the independent risk areas monitor the risks generated by the first line of defense, review and challenge the implementation of effective risk management practices, perform independent assessment of risk, and report on issues or exceptions. The risk areas help to ensure processes and controls owned by the businesses are designed and operating as intended\n.\nThird line of defense\n – As the third line of defense, Internal Audit is independent from the first and second lines of defense. Internal Audit provides the Board of Directors and executive management comprehensive assurance on the effectiveness of the ERM Framework and the risk management practices across the organization.\nWithin the three lines of defense, the independent risk organization has sufficient authority to influence material decisions. Our business oversight and decision-making is supported through a governance structure at the Board of Directors and management level. Specific responsibilities include:\nBoard of Directors –\n Our Board of Directors oversees our business and affairs as managed by our officers and employees. The Board of Directors may receive assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate authority through standing or special committees. The following provides a summary of some of the key responsibilities of the Board’s standing committees:\n•\nAudit Committee\n: monitors the integrity of our consolidated financial statements; monitors internal control over financial reporting; monitors compliance with our code of ethics; evaluates and monitors the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and evaluates and monitors the performance of our Internal Audit function and our independent auditors.\n•\nNominating and Governance Committee\n: oversees the implementation of sound corporate governance principles and practices while promoting our best interests and those of our shareholders.\n•\nHuman Resources Committee\n: oversees the compensation of our executive officers and other specified responsibilities related to talent and human capital matters affecting us, including succession planning. The committee is also responsible for evaluating the relationship between risk-taking activities and incentive compensation plans.\n•\nRisk Committee\n: oversees our enterprise-wide risk structure and the processes established to identify, measure, monitor and manage the organization’s risks and evaluates and approves our risk governance framework. \n•\nCorporate Responsibility Committee\n: oversees management’s corporate responsibility efforts, internally and externally, to the extent such corporate responsibility efforts are not specifically within the purview of another Board committee (e.g., climate-related risks overseen by the Risk Committee and climate-related financial disclosures overseen by the Audit Committee), and implementation of PNC’s publicly-announced Community Benefits Plan to provide loans, investments and other financial support to bolster economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income individuals and communities and other underserved individuals and communities, and to help remove historic barriers in the banking system.\n•\nTechnology Committee\n: oversees technology strategy and significant technology initiatives and programs, including those that can position the use of technology to drive strategic advantages, and fulfills the oversight responsibilities delegated from the Risk Committee with respect to technology risk, technology risk management, data risk, cybersecurity, information security, business continuity and significant technology initiatives and programs.\nManagement Executive Committee \n–\n \nThe Management Executive Committee is responsible for guiding the creation and execution of our business strategy across PNC. With this responsibility, the Management Executive Committee executes various strategic approval and review activities, with a focus on capital deployment, business performance and risk management.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n57\n \nCorporate Committees\n – The Corporate Committees generally operate based on the delegated approval authority from a Board-level Committee, the Management Executive Committee or other Corporate Committees. These Committees operate at the senior management level and are designed to facilitate the review, evaluation, oversight and approval of key business and risk activities. \nWorking Committees\n – Working Committees generally operate on delegated approval authority from a Corporate Committee or other Working Committees. Working Committees are intended to provide oversight of regulatory/legal matters, assist in the implementation of key enterprise-level activities within a business or function and support the oversight of key risk activities. \nTransactional Committees\n – Transactional Committees generally operate based on delegated approval authority from a Corporate or Working Committee to approve individual transactions, transactional related activities or movements on the organization’s balance sheet. \nPolicies and Procedures\n – We have established risk management Policies and Procedures to support our ERM Framework, articulate our risk culture, define the parameters and processes within which employees are to manage risk and conduct our business activities and to provide direction, guidance and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the Board of Directors. These Policies and Procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant Committees, including where appropriate Committees of the Board of Directors, or management. \nRisk Identification\nRisk identification takes place across a variety of risk types throughout the organization. These risk types include, but are not limited to, credit, liquidity, market and operational (which includes, among other types of risk, compliance and information security). Risks are identified based on a balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our governance structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment of key risk issues, emerging risks and idiosyncratic risks and implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. These risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and assessed against our risk appetite. Multiple tools and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including Risk Appetite Metrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key Performance Indicators, Risk and Control Self-Assessments, scenario analysis, stress testing and special assessments. \nRisks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions and businesses. The aggregated risk information is reviewed and reported at an enterprise level to the Board of Directors or appropriate committees. This enterprise aggregation and reporting approach promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to our risk appetite.\nRisk Assessments\nOnce risks are identified, they are evaluated based on quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether they are material. Risk assessments support the overall management of an effective ERM Framework and help us to control and monitor our actual risk level and risk management effectiveness. Comprehensive, accurate and timely assessments of risk are essential to an effective ERM Framework. Risk assessments also support the implementation of mitigation strategies, or under certain circumstances, the decision to accept the risk (if there are no feasible alternatives to the business need, or the exposure may be significantly reduced or eliminated within a reasonable time frame through the course of business-as-usual activities). As part of the risk assessment processes, effective risk measurement practices are designed to uncover recurring risks that have been experienced in the past; facilitate the monitoring, understanding, analysis and reporting of known risks, including emerging risks; and reveal unanticipated risks that may not be easy to understand or predict.\nRisk Controls and Monitoring\nOur ERM Framework consists of policies, procedures, processes, personnel and control systems. Risk controls and limits provide the linkage from our Risk Appetite Statement and associated guiding principles to the risk-taking activities of our businesses. In addition to risk appetite limits, a system of more detailed internal controls exists which oversees and monitors our various processes and functions. These control systems measure performance, help employees make correct decisions, help ensure information is accurate and reliable and facilitate compliance with laws and regulations.\nWe design our monitoring and evaluation of risks and controls to provide assurance that policies, procedures and controls are effective and also to identify potential control improvements. Risk monitoring is a daily, ongoing process used by both the first and second line of defense to help ensure compliance with our ERM Framework. Risk monitoring is accomplished in many ways, including performing risk assessments at the business and risk assessment unit level, monitoring an area’s key controls, the timely reporting of issues and establishing a quality control and/or quality assurance function, as applicable.\nRisk Aggregation and Reporting\nRisk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i) identify and communicate aggregate risks, including identified concentrations and themes; (ii) escalate instances where we are outside of our risk appetite; (iii) monitor our risk profile in relation to our risk appetite; and (iv) communicate risks and views on the effectiveness of our risk management activities through the governance structure up to the Board of Directors and executive management.\n58\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nRisk reports are produced at the line of business, functional risk and enterprise levels. Each individual risk report includes an assessment of inherent risk, quality of risk management, residual risk, risk appetite and risk outlook. The enterprise level risk report aggregates material risks identified in the risk area reports and in the business reports to define the enterprise risk profile. The enterprise risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of enterprise risk and represents our overall risk position in relation to the desired enterprise risk appetite. The determination of the enterprise risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of risk limits and other measures along with qualitative assessments. Quarterly aggregation of risk reports from the risk areas and lines of business is designed to provide a clear view of our risk level relative to our risk appetite. The enterprise level report is provided through the governance structure to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with the contractual terms of their loan, extension of credit or other financial obligation with PNC. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are designed to be embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board of Directors through our governance structure. Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.\nLoan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis\nTable 15: Details of Loans \nIn billions\nWe use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.\nCommercial\nC\nommercial and Industrial\nCommercial and industrial loans comprised 56% and 55% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment should a borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business assets. \nWe actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n59\n \nmonitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following table (based on the North American Industry Classification System).\nTable 16: Commercial and Industrial Loans by Industry \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDollars in millions\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nCommercial and industrial\nRetail/wholesale trade\n$\n30,010 \n17 \n%\n$\n28,198 \n16 \n%\nFinancial services\n27,737 \n16 \n28,422 \n16 \nManufacturing\n27,700 \n16 \n28,989 \n16 \nService providers\n21,881 \n12 \n21,354 \n12 \nReal estate related (a)\n14,910 \n8 \n16,235 \n9 \nTechnology, media and telecommunications\n9,767 \n6 \n10,249 \n6 \nHealth care\n9,694 \n6 \n9,808 \n6 \nTransportation and warehousing\n7,320 \n4 \n7,733 \n4 \nOther industries\n26,771 \n15 \n26,592 \n15 \nTotal commercial and industrial loans\n$\n175,790 \n100 \n%\n$\n177,580 \n100 \n%\n(a)\nRepresents loans to customers in the real estate and construction industries.\nOwner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $9.2 billion and $9.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These loans are included in commercial and industrial loans as the credit decisioning for servicing these loans is based on the financial conditions of the owner, not the ability of the collateral to generate income. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are well-diversified across industries.\nCommercial Real Estate\nCommercial real estate loans of $33.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 comprised $19.3 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, $8.6 billion of intermediate-term financing loans and $5.7 billion of real estate construction project loans. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $35.4 billion, $21.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. Commercial real estate primarily consists of an investment in land and/or buildings held to generate income which serves as the primary source for the repayment of the loan. However, for all commercial real estate assets, the disposition of the assigned collateral serves as a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties.  \nWe monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S. \n60\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nThe following table presents our commercial real estate loans by geography and property type: \nTable 17: Commercial Real Estate Loans by Geography and Property Type \n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDollars in millions\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nGeography (a)\nCalifornia\n$\n5,675 \n17 \n%\n$\n6,133 \n17 \n%\nFlorida\n3,807 \n11 \n3,738 \n11 \nTexas\n3,763 \n11 \n3,733 \n11 \nVirginia\n1,476 \n4 \n1,590 \n4 \nArizona\n1,438 \n4 \n1,216 \n3 \nPennsylvania\n1,213 \n4 \n1,515 \n4 \nMaryland\n1,169 \n3 \n1,344 \n4 \nNorth Carolina\n1,150 \n3 \n1,142 \n3 \nOhio\n1,107 \n3 \n1,157 \n3 \nIllinois\n1,090 \n3 \n1,201 \n3 \nOther\n11,731 \n37 \n12,667 \n37 \nTotal commercial real estate loans\n$\n33,619 \n100 \n%\n$\n35,436 \n100 \n%\nProperty Type (a)\nMultifamily\n$\n16,089 \n48 \n%\n$\n15,590 \n44 \n%\nOffice\n6,707 \n20 \n8,019 \n23 \nIndustrial/warehouse\n3,911 \n12 \n4,089 \n12 \nRetail\n2,090 \n6 \n2,490 \n7 \nSeniors housing\n1,731 \n5 \n1,772 \n5 \nHotel/motel\n1,567 \n5 \n1,760 \n5 \nMixed use\n336 \n1 \n388 \n1 \nOther\n1,188 \n3 \n1,328 \n3 \nTotal commercial real estate loans\n$\n33,619 \n100 \n%\n$\n35,436 \n100 \n%\n(a)\nPresented in descending order based on loan balances at December 31, 2024.\nCommercial Real Estate: Office Portfolio\nGiven the fundamental change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work, real estate performance related to the office sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. At December 31, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $6.7 billion, or 2.1% of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.2 billion. The portfolio is well diversified geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. Within the office portfolio at December 31, 2024, criticized loans totaled 30.5% and nonperforming loans totaled 12.6%, while delinquencies were 0.6%. As measured at origination, the weighted average LTV for the office portfolio was 58.8%; however, for those loans that received appraisals in 2024, the weighted average LTV for those loans has increased to 81.8% as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, PNC received updated appraisals for 44.8% of the outstanding balance in the office portfolio. While LTV is one consideration, our risk assessment considers a number of factors in assessing the changing conditions affecting the portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, we have established reserves of 13.3% against office loans.\nThe greatest stress in our office portfolio is observed in multi-tenant office loans, which represents 54.0% of the portfolio at December 31, 2024. Within the multi-tenant classification, criticized levels were 53.0% while nonperforming loans totaled 22.7%, accounting for almost all of the nonperforming office population. For multi-tenant office loans that received appraisals in 2024, the weighted average LTV for those loans was 86.3% at December 31, 2024. During 2024, PNC received updated appraisals for 66.4% of the outstanding balance in the multi-tenant office portfolio. Additionally, commercial real estate charge-offs since the beginning of 2024 have primarily been multi-tenant office loans. Given the higher level of expected stress, this segment has a proportionally higher reserve rate of 19.9% as of December 31, 2024. The remaining 46.0% of the office portfolio is primarily comprised of single-tenant, medical and government tenant properties. These three tenant classifications are performing considerably better, with approximately 3.8% of the book in the criticized loan category and 0.6% in the nonperforming loan category. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average LTV inclusive of both updated property values and origination-derived values of this book is 59.9%. \nThe office portfolio remains an elevated area of focus for portfolio management, with internal risk ratings completed quarterly for each asset with the exception of medical office loans, accelerated reappraisal requirements and elevated approval levels for any credit action. Additionally, active management efforts include ongoing performance assessments as well as the review of property, lending and capital markets. Portfolio updates are distributed to senior management weekly. Collateral in the office portfolio is appraised by qualified, independent third-party state certified real estate appraisers. New loans or loans being evaluated for extension or material modification are required to be appraised. The frequency of reappraisals outside of a credit action is based on regulatory and internal requirements. Generally, for loans with heightened risk, a cadence has been established to obtain updated appraisals at least annually \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n61\n \nto aid in determining the timing and amount of a charge-off, if deemed necessary. Loans that do not demonstrate a heightened risk are monitored through our ongoing management of the portfolio, including any need for a new appraisal. All appraisals are reviewed by independent qualified real estate valuation personnel. For existing office building loans, PNC employs the as-is market value from third-party appraisals to calculate LTV.\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty in this area, we expect additional stress in the office sector, and a portion of this stress will bear itself out as we work through maturities that will approximate 40% through December 31, 2025. Upon maturity, and where the balance is not paid in full, an extension may be granted because contractual extension terms are met; alternatively, an extension may be granted based on negotiated terms, and a portion of these extensions may involve the curtailment or charge-off of principal. We continue to actively manage the portfolio, and we believe reserve levels reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio.\nCommercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the multifamily portfolio totaled $16.1 billion, or 5.1% of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $2.3 billion. Although inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and elevated supply in certain markets have impacted internal risk assessments and regulatory classification in this portfolio, we have not seen a notable change in loan performance at this time with regards to nonperformance, delinquency or charge-offs. Additionally, the portfolio is well diversified geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. We continue to closely monitor our exposure in this sector.\nConsumer\nResidential Real Estate\n \nResidential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g.\n, nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. \nThe following table presents certain key statistics related to our residential real estate portfolio: \nTable 18: Residential Real Estate Loan Statistics\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDollars in millions\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nGeography (a)\nCalifornia\n$\n19,869 \n43 \n%\n$\n19,911 \n42 \n%\nTexas\n3,748 \n8 \n4,009 \n8 \nWashington\n3,481 \n7 \n3,467 \n7 \nFlorida\n3,171 \n7 \n3,356 \n7 \nNew Jersey\n1,847 \n4 \n1,909 \n4 \nNew York\n1,493 \n3 \n1,551 \n3 \nArizona\n1,340 \n3 \n1,431 \n3 \nPennsylvania\n1,197 \n3 \n1,229 \n3 \nColorado\n1,139 \n2 \n1,187 \n2 \nNorth Carolina\n963 \n2 \n989 \n2 \nOther\n8,167 \n18 \n8,505 \n19 \nTotal residential real estate loans\n$\n46,415 \n100 \n%\n$\n47,544 \n100 \n%\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-average loan origination statistics (b)\nLoan origination FICO score\n773\n772\nLTV of loan originations\n73 \n%\n73 \n%\n(a)\nPresented in descending order based on loan balances at December 31, 2024.\n(b)\nWeighted-averages calculated for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $41.7 billion at \n62\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nDecember 31, 2024 with 46% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $42.4 billion and 45%, respectively. \nHome Equity\nHome equity loans of $26.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 were comprised of $21.3 billion of home equity lines of credit and $4.7 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $26.2 billion, $20.6 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. Home equity lines of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to certain borrowers. \nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least quarterly. Borrower performance of this portfolio is tracked on a monthly basis. We also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of whether we hold such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.\nThe credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.\nThe following table presents certain key statistics related to our home equity portfolio:\n \nTable 19: Home Equity Loan Statistics\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDollars in millions\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nGeography (a)\nPennsylvania\n$\n4,504 \n17 \n%\n$\n4,745 \n18 \n%\nNew Jersey\n3,153 \n12 \n3,184 \n12 \nFlorida\n2,239 \n9 \n2,230 \n9 \nOhio\n2,145 \n8 \n2,242 \n9 \nCalifornia\n1,743 \n7 \n1,580 \n6 \nTexas\n1,299 \n5 \n1,230 \n5 \nMaryland\n1,209 \n5 \n1,237 \n5 \nMichigan\n1,166 \n4 \n1,214 \n5 \nIllinois\n1,032 \n4 \n1,069 \n4 \nNorth Carolina\n1,001 \n4 \n1,001 \n4 \nOther\n6,500 \n25 \n6,418 \n23 \nTotal home equity loans\n$\n25,991 \n100 \n%\n$\n26,150 \n100 \n%\nLien type\n1st lien\n49 \n%\n52 \n%\n2nd lien\n51 \n48 \nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-average loan origination statistics (b)\nLoan origination FICO score\n773\n772\nLTV of loan originations\n62 \n%\n64 \n%\n(a)\nPresented in descending order based on loan balances at December 31, 2024.\n(b)\nWeighted-averages calculated for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n \n \nAutomobile\nAuto loans of $15.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 comprised $14.4 billion in the indirect auto portfolio and $1.0 billion in the direct auto portfolio. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $14.9 billion, $13.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio consists of loans originated primarily through independent franchised dealers, including dealers located in our newer markets. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n63\n \nThe following table presents certain key statistics related to our indirect and direct auto portfolios:\nTable 20: Auto Loan Statistics\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-average loan origination FICO score (a) (b)\nIndirect auto\n793\n788\nDirect auto\n786\n787\nWeighted-average term of loan originations - in months (a)\nIndirect auto\n72\n73\nDirect auto\n64\n65\n(a)\nWeighted-averages calculated for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n(b)\nCalculated using the auto enhanced FICO scale.\nWe continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores noted in Table 20. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At December 31, 2024, the portfolio balance was composed of 43% new vehicle loans and 57% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were 45% and 55%, respectively.\nThe auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including both updated collateral values and FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.\nNonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for details on our nonaccrual policies.\nThe following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets by major category:\nTable 21: Nonperforming Assets by Type \n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\nDollars in millions\n$\n%\nNonperforming loans\n \n \n \n \nCommercial \n$\n1,462 \n$\n1,307 \n$\n155 \n12%\nConsumer (a)\n864 \n873 \n(9)\n(1)%\nTotal nonperforming loans\n2,326 \n2,180 \n146 \n7%\nOREO and foreclosed assets\n31 \n36 \n(5)\n(14)%\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n2,357 \n$\n2,216 \n$\n141 \n6%\nNonperforming loans to total loans\n0.73 \n%\n0.68 \n%\nNonperforming assets to total loans, OREO and foreclosed assets\n0.74 \n%\n0.69 \n%\nNonperforming assets to total assets\n0.42 \n%\n0.39 \n%\nAllowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans \n193 \n%\n220 \n%\n \n \nAllowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans (b)\n224 \n%\n250 \n%\n(a)\nExcludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged-off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.\n(b)\nCalculated excluding allowances for investment securities and other financial assets.\nIncreases in nonperforming assets from December 31, 2023 were primarily driven by higher commercial real estate nonperforming loans.\n64\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nThe following table provides details on the change in nonperforming assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nTable 22: Change in Nonperforming Assets    \nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nJanuary 1\n$\n2,216 \n$\n2,019 \nNew nonperforming assets\n2,245 \n1,999 \nCharge-offs and valuation adjustments\n(685)\n(452)\nPrincipal activity, including paydowns and payoffs\n(1,112)\n(831)\nAsset sales and transfers to loans held for sale\n(53)\n(71)\nReturned to performing status\n(254)\n(448)\nDecember 31\n$\n2,357 \n$\n2,216 \nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 96% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral. \nLoan Delinquencies\nWe regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to address operating environment changes such as inflation levels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and secular changes such as those arising from the pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and collection programs to assist our customers.\nThe following table presents a summary of accruing loans past due by delinquency status:\nTable 23: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)\n \nAmount\n  \n  \n% of Total Loans Outstanding\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDollars in millions\n$\n%\nEarly stage loan delinquencies\nAccruing loans past due 30 to 59 days\n$\n697 \n$\n685 \n$\n12 \n2 \n%\n0.22 \n%\n0.21 \n%\nAccruing loans past due 60 to 89 days\n288 \n270 \n18 \n7 \n%\n0.09 \n%\n0.08 \n%\nTotal early stage loan delinquencies\n985 \n955 \n30 \n3 \n%\n0.31 \n%\n0.30 \n%\nLate stage loan delinquencies\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more\n397 \n429 \n(32)\n(7)\n%\n0.13 \n%\n0.13 \n%\nTotal accruing loans past due\n$\n1,382 \n$\n1,384 \n$\n(2)\n \n0.44 \n%\n0.43 \n%\n(a)\nPast due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.\nLoan Modifications\nWe may provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship relief programs.

We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments. \nExpected losses are estimated primarily using a combination of (i) the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) a period of reversion to long run average expected losses, where applicable and (iii) long run average expected losses for the remaining estimated contractual term. \nWe use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period. For this purpose, we have established a framework which includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios and associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Forward-looking information, such as forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, is incorporated into the expected credit loss estimates using quantitative macroeconomic models, as well as through analysis from PNC’s economists and management’s judgment. \nThe reversion period is used to bridge our three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long-run average expected credit losses. We consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such as contractual maturity of the asset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the long run average period. The reversion period is typically 1-3 years, if not immediate. \nThe long-run average expected credit losses are derived from available historical credit information. We use long-run average expected losses for the portfolio over the estimated remaining contractual term beyond our reasonable and supportable forecast period and the reversion period.\nThe following discussion provides additional information on our reserves for loans and leases as well as unfunded lending related commitments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for further discussion on our ACL, including details of our methodologies and discussion of the allowances for investment securities and other financial assets. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Report for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of December 31, 2024.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is based upon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD and the remaining estimated contractual term for a loan, loan segment or lease. We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on the estimated contractual term in our expected loss estimates. We use historical data, current borrower characteristics and forecasted economic \n66\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nvariables in quantitative methods to estimate these risk parameters by loan, loan segment or lease. PD represents a quantification of risk of the likelihood that a borrower may not be able to pay their contractual obligation over a defined period of time. LGD describes the estimated magnitude of potential loss if a borrower were to default, and EAD (or utilization rates for certain revolving loans) is the estimated balance outstanding at the expected time of default. These parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the long-run average period, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario in proportion to the scenario weights. \nFor loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans, we establish individually assessed reserves using methods prescribed by GAAP. Reserves for individual commercial nonperforming loans exceeding a defined dollar threshold are based on an analysis of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans. Commercial nonperforming loans that are below the defined threshold are collectively reserved for, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics. For consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts previously charged-off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.\nWhile our reserve models and methodologies strive to reflect all relevant expected credit risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between expected and actual outcomes. We may hold additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. A portion of the allowance is related to qualitative measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to:\n•\nIndustry concentrations and conditions,  \n•\nChanges in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements,\n•\nChanges in the nature and volume of our portfolio,\n•\nRecent credit quality trends,\n•\nRecent loss experience in particular portfolios, including specific and unique events,\n•\nRecent macroeconomic factors that may not be reflected in the forecast information,\n•\nLimitations of available input data, including historical loss information and recent data such as collateral values,\n•\nModel imprecision and limitations,\n•\nChanges in lending policies and procedures, including changes in loss recognition and mitigation policies and procedures, and\n•\nTiming of available information.\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related Commitments\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable, (\ne.g., \nunfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and certain financial guarantees) at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for pooled loans and leases. The allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to this reserve are included in the provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n67\n \nThe following table summarizes our ACL related to loans:\nTable 25: Allowance for Credit Losses by Loan Class (a)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDollars in millions\nAllowance Amount\nTotal Loans\n% of Total Loans\nAllowance Amount\nTotal Loans\n% of Total Loans\nAllowance for loans and lease losses\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n1,605 \n$\n175,790 \n0.91 \n%\n$\n1,806 \n$\n177,580 \n1.02 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n1,483 \n33,619 \n4.41 \n%\n1,371 \n35,436 \n3.87 \n%\nEquipment lease financing\n60 \n6,755 \n0.89 \n%\n82 \n6,542 \n1.25 \n%\nTotal commercial\n3,148 \n216,164 \n1.46 \n%\n3,259 \n219,558 \n1.48 \n%\nConsumer\nResidential real estate\n37 \n46,415 \n0.08 \n%\n61 \n47,544 \n0.13 \n%\nHome equity\n266 \n25,991 \n1.02 \n%\n276 \n26,150 \n1.06 \n%\nAutomobile\n160 \n15,355 \n1.04 \n%\n173 \n14,860 \n1.16 \n%\nCredit card\n664 \n6,879 \n9.65 \n%\n766 \n7,180 \n10.67 \n%\nEducation\n48 \n1,636 \n2.93 \n%\n56 \n1,945 \n2.88 \n%\nOther consumer\n163 \n4,027 \n4.05 \n%\n200 \n4,271 \n4.68 \n%\nTotal consumer\n1,338 \n100,303 \n1.33 \n%\n1,532 \n101,950 \n1.50 \n%\nTotal \n$\n4,486 \n$\n316,467 \n1.42 \n%\n$\n4,791 \n$\n321,508 \n1.49 \n%\nAllowance for unfunded lending related commitments\n719 \n663 \nAllowance for credit losses\n$\n5,205 \n$\n5,454 \nAllowance for credit losses to total loans\n1.64 \n%\n1.70 \n%\nCommercial\n1.72 \n%\n1.73 \n%\nConsumer\n1.47 \n%\n1.62 \n%\n(a)        Excludes allowances for investment securities and other financial assets, which together totaled $114 million and $120 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n68\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nThe following table summarizes our loan charge-offs and recoveries:\nTable 26: Loan Charge-Offs and Recoveries \nYear ended December 31\nDollars in millions\nGross \nCharge-offs\nRecoveries\nNet Charge-offs / (Recoveries)\n% of Average Loans\n2024\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n328 \n$\n119 \n$\n209 \n0.12 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n358 \n13 \n345 \n0.98 \n%\nEquipment lease financing\n34 \n17 \n17 \n0.26 \n%\nTotal commercial\n720 \n149 \n571 \n0.26 \n%\nConsumer\nResidential real estate\n3 \n10 \n(7)\n(0.01)\n%\nHome equity\n36 \n42 \n(6)\n(0.02)\n%\nAutomobile\n131 \n97 \n34 \n0.23 \n%\nCredit card\n355 \n55 \n300 \n4.38 \n%\nEducation\n19 \n6 \n13 \n0.73 \n%\nOther consumer\n171 \n35 \n136 \n3.29 \n%\nTotal consumer\n715 \n245 \n470 \n0.47 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,435 \n$\n394 \n$\n1,041 \n0.33 \n%\n2023\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n244 \n$\n122 \n$\n122 \n0.07 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n180 \n6 \n174 \n0.48 \n%\nEquipment lease financing\n18 \n9 \n9 \n0.14 \n%\nTotal commercial\n442 \n137 \n305 \n0.14 \n%\nConsumer\nResidential real estate\n8 \n13 \n(5)\n(0.01)\n%\nHome equity\n21 \n46 \n(25)\n(0.10)\n%\nAutomobile\n121 \n100 \n21 \n0.14 \n%\nCredit card\n319 \n43 \n276 \n3.93 \n%\nEducation\n17 \n7 \n10 \n0.48 \n%\nOther consumer\n164 \n36 \n128 \n2.77 \n%\nTotal consumer\n650 \n245 \n405 \n0.40 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,092 \n$\n382 \n$\n710 \n0.22 \n%\nTotal net charge-offs increased $331 million, or 47%, in 2024 compared to 2023.

These risk events may impact a borrower’s income, cash flow or collateral due to the frequency or severity of weather events, changing market conditions, consumer preferences and demand for products, or changes to the legislative and regulatory landscape. As disruptive events occur, PNC follows a process to determine if enhanced portfolio monitoring, reporting and executive communication is warranted to ensure appropriate oversight and action. Credit Risk Management also participates as members of the Climate Risk Committee which provides a forum for the discussion, assessment, and monitoring of enterprise-wide activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on climate-related risks and issues which may include updates to PNC’s Credit Portfolio Strategy Committee. Credit Risk Management also takes into account potential environmental, human rights and other reputational risks as part of its holistic review of industries and sectors and to the extent those risks may impact credit risk would participate in portfolio decisions regarding those impacts. Outcomes from those climate and other risk reviews may be incorporated into credit policies and risk procedures that govern our risk appetite, credit decisioning, portfolio management and reserve processes. Additionally, PNC has procedures designed to ensure that flood insurance is present for properties as required by applicable regulations, while also monitoring other water-related risks (such as the increased shoreline and coastal erosion) and weather-related events (such as hurricanes and wildfires). \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n69\n \nLiquidity and Capital Management\n \nThe two fundamental components of liquidity risk are a potential loss assuming we are unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost, and the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available. We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company and all subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances. We also maintain a liquidity position and use liquidity risk management practices that we believe are appropriate considering PNC and PNC Bank’s capital adequacy, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size, as well as applicable regulatory liquidity requirements and associated regulatory practices.\nWe perform ongoing monitoring of liquidity through a series of early warning indicators tailored to PNC’s risk profile, complexity, activities, and size that may identify a potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity stress event. In addition, management performs a set of internal liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress event. Liquidity-related risk limits and operating guidelines are established within our Enterprise Liquidity Management Policy covering regulatory metrics and various concentration limits. Management committees, including the ALCO, and the Board of Directors and its Risk Committee regularly review compliance with key established limits. PNC was in compliance with all relevant internal and regulatory liquidity limits and guidelines throughout the year for 2024 and 2023.\nOne of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the year for 2024 and 2023. Fluctuations in our LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net cash outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity.\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The NSFR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the year for 2024 and 2023.\nWe provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $426.7 billion at December 31, 2024 from $421.4 billion at December 31, 2023 reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits increased due to higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances.\nThe aggregate amount of uninsured deposits, based on the regulatory instructions in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income - FFIEC 031, were estimated to be $194.9 billion and $190.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The portion of U.S. time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit or similar state deposit regime was $5.1 billion at December 31, 2024. The majority of our uninsured deposits are related to commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit customers who utilize two or more PNC products. See the Funding Sources in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and the Business Segments Review of this Item 7 for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.\nWe may also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, such as senior notes, subordinated debt, FHLB advances, securities\nsold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. See the Funding Sources in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review of this Item 7 and Note 9 Borrowed Funds included in this Report for additional information related to our borrowings.\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:\nTable 27: Senior and Subordinated Debt \nIn billions\n2024\nJanuary 1\n$\n31.7 \nIssuances\n10.0 \nCalls and maturities\n(4.8)\nOther\n(0.3)\nDecember 31\n$\n36.6 \nAdditionally, PNC maintains access to contingent funding sources that include unused borrowing capacity and certain liquid assets.\n70\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nPNC has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of liquidity stress. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization’s liquidity under various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan’s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides the strategies for addressing liquidity needs and responsive actions we would consider during liquidity stress events, which could include the issuance of incremental debt, preferred stock, or additional deposit actions, including the issuance of brokered CDs. The plan also addresses the governance, frequency of reporting and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of liquidity stress.\nPNC defines our primary contingent liquidity sources as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities and unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. The following table summarizes our primary contingent liquidity sources at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nTable 28\n: \nPrimary Contingent Liquidity Sources \nIn billions\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash balance with Federal Reserve Bank\n$\n39.0 \n$\n43.3 \nInvestment securities (a)\n64.5 \n98.5\nUnused borrowing capacity from FHLB (b)\n51.0 \n35.4\nUnused borrowing capacity from Federal Reserve Bank (c)\n77.9 \n47.2\n    Total available contingent liquidity\n$\n232.4 \n$\n224.4 \n(a)\nRepresents the fair value of investment securities that can be used for pledging or to secure other sources of funding.\n(b)\nAt December 31, 2024, total FHLB borrowing capacity was $73.3 billion and total FHLB advances and letters of credit were $22.3 billion. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $73.4 billion and $38.0 billion, respectively.\n(c)\nTotal borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank was $77.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $47.2 billion at December 31, 2023. PNC had no outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nAs part of PNC’s contingency planning, during 2024 we increased the amount of investment securities prepositioned at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window, supporting our resilience and operational readiness.\nBank Liquidity\nIn addition to our primary contingent liquidity sources, under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At December 31, 2024, PNC Bank’s remaining capacity to issue under the program was $32.3 billion. \nUnder PNC Bank’s 2013 commercial paper program, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or issuing intercompany unsecured notes. \nThe following table details PNC Bank note issuances during 2024: \nTable 29: PNC Bank Notes Issued\nIssuance Date\nAmount\nDescription of Issuance\nDecember 2, 2024\n$500 million\n$500 million in aggregate principal amount of its senior floating rate notes due January 15, 2027.

Beginning on January 15, 2026, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest period using the SOFR Index as described in the pricing supplement), plus 0.504%, on April 15, 2026, July 15, 2026, October 15, 2026 and at the maturity date.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n71\n \nThe following table details PNC Bank note redemptions during 2024: \nTable 30: PNC Bank Notes Redeemed\nRedemption Date\nAmount\nDescription of Redemption\nNovember 4, 2024\n$200 million\nAll outstanding senior floating rate bank notes with an original scheduled maturity date of December 2, 2024.  The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date of November 4, 2024.\nParent Company Liquidity\nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, available parent company liquidity totaled $24.8 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash and investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.\nThe principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:\n•\nBank-level capital needs,\n•\nLaws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities, \n•\nCorporate policies,\n•\nContractual restrictions, and\n•\nOther factors.\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was $7.4 billion at December 31, 2024. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters for further discussion of these limitations.\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Under the parent company’s 2014 commercial paper program, the parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At December 31, 2024, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.\n72\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nThe following table details Parent Company note issuances during 2024: \nTable 31: Parent Company Notes Issued\nIssuance Date\nAmount\nDescription of Issuance\nJanuary 22, 2024\n$1.0 billion\n$1.0 billion of senior fixed-to-floating rate notes with a maturity date of January 21, 2028.

The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date of October 28, 2024.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments \nWe enter into various contractual arrangements in the normal course of business, certain of which require future payments that could\nimpact our liquidity and capital resources. These obligations include commitments to extend credit, outstanding letters of credit,\ncustomer deposits, borrowed funds, operating lease payments and future pension and post-retirement benefits. For further discussion\nrelated to these contractual obligations and other commitments, see Note 6 Leases, Note 8 Time Deposits, Note 9 Borrowed Funds,\nNote 10 Commitments and Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n73\n \nCredit Ratings\nPNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.\nIn general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on the potential impacts from a downgrade to our credit ratings, see Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report.\nThe following table presents credit ratings and outlook for PNC as of December 31, 2024:\nTable 33: Credit Ratings and Outlook \nDecember 31, 2024\n  \nMoody’s\nStandard & Poor’s (a)\nFitch\nPNC\nSenior debt\nA3\nA-\nA\nSubordinated debt\nA3\nBBB+\nA-\nPreferred stock\nBaa2\nBBB-\nBBB\nPNC Bank\nSenior debt\nA2\nA\nA+\nSubordinated debt\nA3\nA-\nA\nLong-term deposits\nAa3\nno rating\nAA-\nShort-term deposits\nP-1\nno rating\nF1+\nShort-term notes\nP-1\nA-1\nF1\nPNC\nAgency rating outlook\nNegative \nStable\n Stable\n(a)  S&P does not provide depositor ratings.

Each depositary share represents 1/100th interest in a share of the Series R preferred stock.\nIn 2024, we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $2.5 billion and repurchases of 3.5 million common shares for $0.6 billion. Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 42% were still available for repurchase at December 31, 2024. First quarter 2025 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly average share repurchase levels. PNC may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.\nOn January 3, 2025, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.60 per share paid on February 5, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business January 15, 2025.\nSee the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business in this Report for further information concerning the CCAR and\nDFAST process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans.\n74\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nThe following table summarizes our Basel III capital balances and ratios:\nTable 34: Basel III Capital\nDecember 31, 2024\nDollars in millions\nBasel III (a)\n(Fully Implemented) (estimated) (b)\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital\nCommon stock plus related surplus, net of treasury stock\n$\n(4,041)\n$\n(4,041)\nRetained earnings\n59,524 \n59,282 \nGoodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities\n(10,699)\n(10,699)\nOther disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities\n(231)\n(231)\nOther adjustments/(deductions)\n(86)\n(86)\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital (c)\n$\n44,467 \n$\n44,225 \nAdditional Tier 1 capital\nPreferred stock plus related surplus\n5,749 \n5,749 \nTier 1 capital\n$\n50,216 \n$\n49,974 \nAdditional Tier 2 capital\nQualifying subordinated debt\n2,211 \n2,211 \nEligible credit reserves includable in Tier 2 capital\n4,903 \n5,142 \nTotal Basel III capital\n$\n57,330 \n$\n57,327 \nRisk-weighted assets\nBasel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (d)\n$\n422,399 \n$\n422,494 \nAverage quarterly adjusted total assets\n$\n556,962 \n$\n556,720 \nSupplementary leverage exposure (e)\n$\n672,278 \n$\n672,277 \nBasel III risk-based capital and leverage ratios (f)\nCommon equity Tier 1\n10.5 \n%\n10.5 \n%\nTier 1 \n11.9 \n%\n11.8 \n%\nTotal\n13.6 \n%\n13.6 \n%\nLeverage (g)\n9.0 \n%\n9.0 \n%\nSupplementary leverage ratio (e)\n7.5 \n%\n7.4 \n%\n(a)\nThe ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC entered a three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard was phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, CECL will be fully reflected in regulatory capital.\n(b)\nThe ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition.\n(c)\nAs permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available-for-sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\n(d)\nBasel III standardized approach risk-weighted-assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.\n(e)\nThe Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. \n(f)\nAll ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.\n(g)\nLeverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.\nPNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC entered a three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard was phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, CECL will be fully reflected in regulatory capital. See additional discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors.\nAt December 31, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\nFederal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n75\n \nto withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our December 31, 2024 capital levels were aligned with them.\nWe provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts, including the proposed rules to adjust the Basel III framework, in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 19 Regulatory Matters.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:\n•\nTraditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,\n•\nFixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, and securities underwriting as a result of customer activities and our investment portfolio, and\n•\nOther investments, including equity, and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors.\nWe have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in the business to management committees and, where appropriate, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nMarket Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets, the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.\nOur Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk management policies, which are approved by management’s ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nPNC utilizes sensitivities of NII and EVE to a set of interest rate scenarios to identify and measure its short-term and long-term structural interest rate risks.\nNII sensitivity results for the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow:\nTable 35: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Analysis \nFourth Quarter 2024\nFourth Quarter 2023\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation (a)\nEffect on NII in the first year from shocked interest rate:\n200 basis point instantaneous increase\n(0.6)\n%\n(0.2)\n%\n200 basis point instantaneous decrease\n(0.5)%\n(0.3)\n%\n(a)\nThe effect on NII in the first year from a 100 basis point instantaneous increase or decrease is not materially different from the 200 basis point scenarios as disclosed above.\nWhen forecasting NII, we make certain key assumptions that can materially impact the resulting sensitivities, including the following:\nFuture Balance Sheet Composition:\n Our balance sheet composition is dynamic and based on our forecasted expectations. As of the fourth quarter 2024, the projected balance sheet composition by the end of year one is generally consistent with the spot composition at December 31, 2024. \nBalance Sheet Forecast:\n Our balance sheet forecast is based on various assumptions that include key interest rate risk aspects such as loan and deposit growth, as well as mix, and is consistent with our guidance.\nDeposit Betas: \nDeposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the Federal Funds rate. PNC’s deposit beta was 47% for\nDecember 2024. We define deposit beta as the change in deposit rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits divided by the change in\nthe upper level of the average stated Federal Funds rate range since August 2024, the start of the current easing rate cycle. For rate\nsensitivity purposes, PNC assumes the cumulative deposit beta will decrease from the current level. Prior to the beginning of the easing cycle, PNC’s beta calculation represented the change in deposit rate paid on interest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the stated Federal Funds rate since the first quarter of 2022, the start of the rising rate cycle. For interest rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels as \n76\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nwell as other factors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect historical experience as well as future expectations, and are periodically updated to reflect the current view of future expectations. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from modeled projections due to variables such as competition for deposits and customer behavior.\nAsset Prepayments:\n PNC includes prepayment assumptions for both loan and investment portfolios. Mortgage and Home Equity portfolios utilize an industry standard model to drive estimated prepayments that increase in lower rate environments. Commercial and other consumer loan portfolios assume static constant prepayment rates that are consistent across rate scenarios, as those portfolios historically do not exhibit significantly different prepayment behaviors based upon the level of market rates.\nImpact of Derivatives\n: As part of our risk management strategy, PNC uses interest rate derivatives, some of which are forward starting, to hedge floating rate commercial loans. PNC had $50.5 billion in active and forward starting receive fix / pay float swaps as of December 31, 2024, with a weighted average duration of 2.4 years and an average fixed rate of 3.45%. As of December 31, 2024 PNC also had collars in place, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of floors, that are used to hedge these commercial loans. Additionally, PNC utilizes receive fix / pay float swaps as a means of hedging fixed rate debt, as well as pay fix / receive float swaps as a means of hedging the investment securities portfolio. See Note 15 Financial Derivatives for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge these financial instruments. \nEVE sensitivity results for the fourth quarter of \n2024\n and \n2023\n follow:\nTable 36: Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Analysis \nFourth Quarter 2024\nFourth Quarter 2023\nEconomic Value of Equity Sensitivity Simulation\n200 basis point instantaneous increase\n(6.5)\n%\n(4.3)\n%\n200 basis point instantaneous decrease\n0.1%\n(3.9)%\nEVE measures the present value of all projected future cash flows associated with a point-in-time balance sheet and does not include projected new volume. EVE sensitivity to interest rate changes is a complementary metric to NII sensitivity analysis and represents an estimation of long-term interest rate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates. Similar to the NII sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions. Directionally, higher deposit beta assumptions result in increasing liability sensitivity whereas lower deposit betas increase asset sensitivity. Conceptually similar, higher loan prepayment assumptions cause an increase in asset sensitivity and lower prepayments result in an increase in liability sensitivity. These behavioral modeling assumptions are largely consistent between the EVE and NII sensitivity analyses, and also share the same starting balance sheet position as of December 31, 2024. Deposit attrition is also a significant contributor to EVE sensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected based on a dynamic model developed using long-term historical deposit behavior in addition to management assumptions including accelerated attrition for pandemic related excess deposits. PNC performs various sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of faster and slower deposit attrition, loan prepayments, and deposit betas on our risk metrics, with the results reported to ALCO.\nPNC’s EVE exposure was balanced between rising and falling rates at the end of 2023, with modest decreases in EVE resulting under either scenario. By the end of 2024, PNC had moderately higher exposure to rate increases and largely neutral impacts to falling rates, primarily as a result of rate increases in the middle and long portions of the yield curve during 2024.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2023, there have been no material changes to our NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions, including data sources that drive assumptions setting.\nMarket Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk\nWe engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit and funding valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2024 and 2023 were within our acceptable limits.\nTo help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. Our VaR measure assumes that exposures remain constant and that recent market variability is a good predictor of future variability. Actual observations include customer-related revenue and intraday hedging, which helps to reduce losses and can reduce the number of instances actual losses exceed the prior day VaR measure. There were no instances during \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n77\n \n2024 and 2023 under our diversified VaR measure where actual losses exceeded the prior-day VaR measure. Our portfolio and enterprise-wide VaR models utilize a historical approach with a 500-day look-back period.\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $122 million in 2024 compared to $137 million in 2023 and is recorded in Capital markets and advisory noninterest income and Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement. The decrease was primarily due to lower derivative client sales revenue, partially offset by higher securities client sales revenue. \nMarket Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk\nEquity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.\nVarious PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.\nA summary of our equity investments follows:\nTable 37: Equity Investments Summary \nDollars in millions\nDecember 31 2024\nDecember 31 2023\nChange\n$\n%\nTax credit investments\n$\n5,066 \n$\n4,331 \n$\n735 \n17 \n%\nPrivate equity and other\n4,534 \n3,983 \n551 \n14 \n%\nTotal\n$\n9,600 \n$\n8,314 \n$\n1,286 \n15 \n%\nTax Credit Investments\nIncluded in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities has further information on tax credit investments.\nPrivate Equity and Other\nThe largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, $2.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies, and $0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds.\n See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report for discussion of the Volcker Rule limitations on our interests in and relationships with private funds.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1\ncommon shares into approximately equal amounts of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. This\nconversion event resulted in a gain of $754 million related to the Visa Class C common shares received. PNC retained the Visa Class\nB-2 common shares. The Visa Class B-2 common shares, which are included in our other equity investments at cost, remain subject to\nthe same restrictions that were imposed on the Visa Class B-1 common shares. Participation in the exchange required PNC to agree to\na make-whole agreement that subjects PNC to the same indemnity obligations to Visa as prior to participation in the exchange\nprogram.\nThe Visa Class B-2 common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until either the resolution of the pending interchange litigation or Visa launches another exchange program allowing PNC to convert a portion of its Visa Class B-2 common shares into freely transferable Visa Class C common shares. At December 31, 2024, the estimated value of our total investment in the Visa Class B-2 common shares was approximately $0.9 billion while our cost basis was insignificant. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa Class B-2 common shares given the shares’ limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace. See Note 14 Fair Value and Note 20 Legal Proceedings for additional information regarding our Visa agreements.\nWe also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $33 million in 2024 and $18 million in 2023.\n78\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nImpact of Inflation\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in\nprices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. However, during periods of inflation,\nthere may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power,\nand fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. When significant levels of inflation occur, our business could\npotentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit\nlosses resulting from possible increased default rates. While interest rates remained high in 2024, inflation has started to slow, leading to an easing of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. See Item 1A Risk Factors, our Executive Summary and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in this Item 7 for further discussion of inflation and its overall impact to the economy, our borrowers’ ability to repay their obligations and certain costs and expenses to PNC.\nFinancial Derivatives\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. \nFurther information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15 Financial Derivatives.\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.\nOperational Risk Management\nOperational risk is the risk to PNC’s current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization.\nOperational risk management is embedded in our culture and decision-making processes through a systematic approach whereby operational risks and exposures are: (i) identified and assessed; (ii) managed through the design and implementation of controls; (iii) measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance limits; and (iv) reported to management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Strong operational risk management and well-informed risk-based decisions benefit us by improving the customer experience, enhancing compliance, reducing reputational risk, minimizing losses, and supporting robust stress testing and capital planning. \nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is designed to provide effective and consistent management of operational risk. The primary purpose of the framework is to enable us to understand our operational risks and manage them to the desired risk profile, in line with our Risk Appetite. Additionally, the guidance established within the framework assists management in making well-informed risk-based business decisions.\nThe framework provides a disciplined and structured process for us to manage operational risk across eight operational risk domains. These domains provide a comprehensive view of operational risk and allow us to discuss operational risk in a standard way, facilitating reporting and ongoing risk mitigation.\nThe operational risk domains are:\n•\nOperations: Risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, misconduct or errors of people or fraud.\n•\nCompliance: Risk arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations including nonconformance with prescribed practices and industry standards driven by self-regulatory organizations.\n•\nData Management: Risk associated with data accuracy, integrity or quality.\n•\nModel: Risk associated with the design, implementation and ongoing use and management of models.\n•\nTechnology and Systems: Risk associated with the use, operation and adoption of technology.\n•\nInformation Security: Risk resulting from the failure to protect information and ensure appropriate access to, and use and handling of, information assets.\n•\nBusiness Continuity: Risk of potential disruptive events to business activities.\n•\nThird Party: Risk arising from failure of third-party providers to conduct activity in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws and regulations.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n79\n \nWe utilize operational risk management programs within the framework, including Risk and Control Self-Assessments, scenario analysis, and internal and external loss event reviews and analysis, to assess existing risks, determine potential/emerging risks and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. Program tools and methodology assist our business managers in identifying potential risks and control gaps.\nLines of business are responsible for identifying, owning, managing and monitoring the operational risks and controls associated with their business activities and product or service offerings to within acceptable levels. Centralized functions, such as Business Continuity, Enterprise Third Party Management and Information Security, are responsible for the development, implementation and management of their individual programs and for the development and maintenance of the policies, procedures, methodologies, tools and technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, monitor and report program risks. Additionally, independent risk management reviews and challenges line of business adherence to the framework to help ensure proper controls are in place and appropriate risk mitigation plans are established as necessary.\nCompliance Risk\nEnterprise Compliance is responsible for oversight of compliance risk for the organization. Compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring and testing activities. Compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of our operational risk profile. A management committee, chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for oversight of compliance and fiduciary risk management programs across PNC. Enterprise Compliance, through the Regulatory Change Program, helps PNC understand and proactively address emerging regulatory topics and risks as well as respond to changes in applicable laws and regulations. To understand emerging issues impacting the industry, Enterprise Compliance communicates regularly with various regulators having supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to us, our subsidiaries, or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory and compliance matters in the financial services industry.\nInformation Security Risk\nThe Information Security component of our Operational Risk Management Framework is responsible for protecting information assets to achieve business objectives, which includes cybersecurity. PNC’s cybersecurity program is designed to identify risks to sensitive information, protect that information, detect threats and events and maintain an appropriate response and recovery capability to help ensure resilience against information security incidents. The program includes, among other things, annual security and privacy training for all PNC employees and quarterly phishing exercises to raise employee awareness. Our security program is also regularly examined by federal regulators for compliance with financial regulations and standards. The program also establishes expectations for information asset management, system development security, identity and access management, incident management, threat and vulnerability management, security operations management and third- and fourth-party security. For additional information, see Item 1C Cybersecurity of this Report.\nConduct, Reputational and Strategic Risk\nPNC’s risk culture seeks to reinforce the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior through sound processes and controls. In order to promote a robust risk culture, the Board and executive management establish code of conduct and professional standards to which all employees must adhere. A strong risk culture discourages misconduct and supports conduct risk management at PNC. Conduct risk is defined as the risk that employees fail to comply with the ethical standards expected of them. Strong conduct risk management is important in supporting PNC’s reputation, and PNC maintains a corporate culture that emphasizes complying with laws, regulations, and managing reputational risks. Reputational risk is the risk to the franchise and/or shareholder value based on a negative perception of PNC by its stakeholders and/or the changing expectations of its stakeholders. As part of assessing those risks, transactions and potential customers may be subjected to an industry-agnostic reputation risk assessment designed to help us better identify and mitigate environmental, human rights and other reputational risks early in the on-boarding process. Transactions and potential customers identified as having these risks are evaluated to determine whether additional due diligence is warranted. Strategic risk is another component of the ERM Framework that is also critical to optimizing shareholder returns. Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity that may arise from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions and/or inadequate response to changes in the business environment. Strategic risk is considered and assessed by our businesses in the annual strategic planning processes and monitored on an on-going basis as those plans are carried out.\n80\n    The PNC Financial

Note 1 Accounting Policies describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated recoveries. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. The major drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:\n•\nCurrent economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.\n•\nScenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to the probability weights assigned to these scenarios and the timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.\n•\nCurrent borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics, including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially affected.\n•\nPortfolio composition: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves\nwould be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.\nWe also incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions, as discussed below and in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of Note 1 Accounting Policies.\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n83\n \n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies.\nReasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast\nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.\nTo forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. Each quarter, the scenarios and their respective weights are presented to RAC for approval.\nThe scenarios used for the period ended December 31, 2024 consider, among other factors, the ongoing inflationary pressures and the corresponding tightness of monetary policy and credit availability. Given these factors, growth is expected to slow from current levels in the coming quarters. While recession risks remain elevated, our most likely expectation at December 31, 2024 is that the U.S. economy avoids a recession.\nWe used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nTable 42: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios\nAssumptions as of December 31, 2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\nU.S. real GDP (a) \n0.7%\n2.2%\n2.2%\nU.S. Unemployment Rate (b)\n4.8%\n4.7%\n4.4%\nAssumptions as of December 31, 2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\nU.S. real GDP (a) \n0.1%\n1.5%\n2.0%\nU.S. Unemployment Rate (c)\n4.5%\n4.6%\n4.2%\n(a)\nRepresents year-over-year growth rates.\n(b)\nRepresents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n(c)\nRepresents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nReal GDP growth is expected to slow by the end of 2025 to 0.7% on a weighted average basis, down from the 1.5% assumed at December 31, 2023. Growth then rebounds to 2.2% where real GDP remains stable through 2026 and 2027. The weighted-average unemployment rate is expected to end 2025 at 4.8%, peaking at 4.9% in 2026 before decreasing to 4.4% by the fourth quarter of 2027. \nTo provide additional context regarding the sensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic forecast of expected economic outcomes, we considered what our ACL would be when applying a 100% probability weighting to the most severe downside CECL scenario. This severe downside scenario estimated that real GDP contracted in 2025 ending the year down 2.5% compared to 2024 levels, with growth picking up again by the end of 2026. The unemployment rate in this scenario increased to end 2025 at 6.6%, then peaks at 7.1% in 2026, before gradually improving to 6.1% by the end of 2027. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2024. This scenario does not reflect our current expectation at December 31, 2024, nor does it capture all the potential unknown variables that could arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions. The CECL methodology inherently requires a high degree of judgment, and as a result, it is possible that we may, at another point in time, reach different conclusions regarding our credit loss estimates.\nQualitative Component \nAs discussed in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of Note 1 Accounting Policies, we incorporate qualitative reserves in the ACL that reflect our best estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, inherent forecasting limitations, model imprecision, timing of available information, and/or emerging and ongoing credit risks. At December 31, 2024, the qualitative framework considers PNC’s \n84\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nview of the current state of the economy, which continues to reflect uncertainty due to the fundamental change in office demand from the acceptance of remote work, inflationary pressures, interest rate movements and housing affordability. Our most significant qualitative factor was related to the office portfolio of the commercial real estate loan class.\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment. Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. \nSee the following for additional details on the components of our ACL:\n•\nAllowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7, and\n•\nNote 1 Accounting Policies, Note 2 Investment Securities, and Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.\n \nResidential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe elect to measure our MSRs at fair value. This election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. The fair value of our MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions.\nWe employ risk management strategies designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. The values of the MSRs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value inverse to the change in fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial MSRs requires significant management judgment to assess how rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time, they are expected to protect the economic value of the MSRs.\nFor information on how each estimate has changed and a sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect of the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes in key assumptions, see Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights. For additional information on our residential and commercial MSRs, see Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 14 Fair Value.\nFair Value Measurements - Level 3\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. When observable price and third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these valuation techniques could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe apply ASC 820 – \nFair Value Measurements\n. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance requires a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs. An asset or liability’s classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances associated with each instrument, and management applies judgment regarding the significance of unobservable inputs to each asset or liability when determining its fair value level classification. In addition to MSRs, certain of our private equity investments and available-for-sale securities have a high level of estimation uncertainty and require significant management judgment to determine the fair value. While estimating potential sensitivities around fair value measurements is inherently challenging, we provide a summary of the key unobservable inputs as well as additional information on Level 3 fair value measurements in Note 14 Fair Value.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n85\n \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Update\nDescription\nFinancial Statement Impact\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures - ASU 2023-09\nIssued December 2023\n• Required with issuance of 2025 Form 10-K; early adoption is permitted.\n• Requires public business entities to, on an annual basis, (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold.\n• Requires that all entities disclose, on an annual basis, (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign taxes, and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received).\n• Allows for either a prospective or retrospective transition approach.\n• We are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements of this ASU and do not plan to early adopt.\n• This ASU will not impact our Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n• We expect to provide additional disaggregated income tax disclosures in accordance with this ASU. \nAccounting Standards Update\nDescription\nFinancial Statement Impact\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses - ASU 2024-03\nIssued November 2024\n• Required with issuance of 2027 Form 10-K; early adoption is permitted.\n• Requires public business entities to disclose, in the notes to financial statements and on an annual and interim basis, specified information about certain costs and expenses (including, if relevant: inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation from oil and gas-producing activities).\n• Requires qualitative descriptions of amounts not separately disaggregated to be disclosed.\n• Requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.\n• Allows for either a prospective or retrospective transition approach.\n• We are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements within this ASU and do not plan to early adopt.\n• This ASU will not impact our Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n• We expect to provide additional disaggregated income statement expense disclosures in accordance with this ASU.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements that we have adopted.\n86\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nC\nAUTIONARY\n S\nTATEMENT\n R\nEGARDING\n F\nORWARD\n-L\nOOKING\n I\nNFORMATION\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. \nForward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.\n•\nOur businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:\n–\nChanges in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,\n–\nDisruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,\n–\nActions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply, market interest rates and inflation,\n–\nChanges in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives,\n–\nChanges in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,\n–\nImpacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n–\nImpacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,\n–\nOur ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and\n–\nCommodity price volatility.\n•\nOur forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on our views that:\n–\nThe labor market remains strong, and job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth in the near term. PNC’s baseline forecast is for continued expansion, but slower economic growth in 2025 than in 2024. High interest rates remain a drag on the economy, consumer spending growth will slow to a pace more consistent with household income growth, and government’s contribution to economic growth will be smaller.\n–\nReal GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 will be approximately 2%, and the unemployment rate will remain somewhat above 4% throughout 2025 and into 2026. There will be little progress on inflation in 2025; wage pressures will abate, but higher tariffs will offset this, and inflation will remain above the Federal Reserve’s 2% objective throughout 2025.\n–\nLittle progress on inflation this year will limit monetary easing. PNC expects two additional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2025, one in May and one in July. The federal funds rate will be in a range between 3.75% and 4.00% in the second half of 2025, and remain in that range into 2026.\n•\nPNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. \n•\nPNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, its financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.\n•\nLegal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. These developments could include:\n–\nChanges to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, and changes in accounting and reporting standards.\n–\nUnfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices, and potentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n–\nResults of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n87\n \n–\nCosts associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.\n•\nBusiness and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n•\nOur reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.\n•\nW\ne grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.\n•\nCompetition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.\n•\nBusiness and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party vendors and service providers specifically. \nWe provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in this Report, including in Item 1A Risk Factors, the Risk Management section of Item 7 and Note 20 Legal Proceedings. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.",
