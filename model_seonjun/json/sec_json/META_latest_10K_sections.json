Our products enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, augmented reality (AR), and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos, videos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build the next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction. \nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content. \nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure capacity. \nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the next computing platform is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods. \n6\nTable of \nContents\nFamily of Apps Products\n•\nFacebook. \nFacebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a place for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover and connect to people with shared interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, Marketplace, and more.\n•\nInstagram. \nInstagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Live, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses. \n•\nMessenger. \nMessenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls. \n•\nThreads. \nThreads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come together to discuss topics of interest. People can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who love the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their ideas, opinions, and creativity with the world.\n•\nWhatsApp. \nWhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses around the world to communicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a one-to-many broadcast service designed to help people follow information from people and organizations that are important to them.\nReality Labs Products\nMany of our Reality Labs investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the near term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse and wearables products and experiences that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere. \nOur metaverse efforts include our VR, MR, and social platform initiatives. Our current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well as software and content available through the Meta Horizon Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while engaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. To drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have introduced MR capabilities, which allow users to experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest devices. \nOur wearables efforts include our AR initiatives. We have continued to advance our roadmap to include additional AI-enabled offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as other features such as hands-free interaction. As we continue our long-term efforts to bring AR glasses to market, in 2024 we also unveiled our Orion prototype, a pair of true AR glasses that overlay content on top of the physical world. It does this with an industry-leading field of view and in glasses form factor for comfortable wear.\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the next computing platform, our metaverse efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our wearables efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research and development projects. For example, in 2025, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our wearables initiatives, and the remaining 50% on our metaverse initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the next computing platform and our business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual reality products and services. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the metaverse.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third parties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network capacity.\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.\nWe also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our Llama models, consisting of state-of-the-art foundation models that are available for researchers and developers to use and build upon. By making our Llama models openly available, we aim to accelerate AI research and development, improve our own products, and to foster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community. \nSales and Operations \nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers, resellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel, Meta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. \nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world. \n8\nTable of \nContents\nIntellectual Property \nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, \n9\nTable of \nContents\nof such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, \n10\nTable of \nContents\nwhich are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results. \nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions. \nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data protection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject rights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\n11\nTable of \nContents\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, everything we do is about helping people feel connected and closer, and we are proud of our unique company culture. \nWe had a global workforce of 74,067 employees as of December 31, 2024, and we have offices in more than 90 cities around the world. We are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are focused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We offer competitive compensation and a wide range of benefits, including many learning and development resources.\nFrom time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, we have previously undertaken cost reduction efforts such as scaling back budgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and employee layoffs and restructurings. We make it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and provide a generous severance package. For U.S. employees, that includes severance payments, payment for all remaining paid time off, and restricted stock unit vesting through their last day on payroll, as well as certain continuing coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families, career services with an external vendor, and immigration support. We offer similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States while taking into account local employment laws. \nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees with regular performance reviews twice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth and career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at Meta. We also offer career development opportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we utilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning communities, and coaching engagements. \nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help us understand how employees feel about working at Meta and what we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal experience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and company changes. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the company. \nCompensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have conducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. For example, in September 2024, we announced that we continue to have pay equity for gender globally and ethnicity in the United States.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we continue to provide our employees and their dependents with resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, \n12\nTable of \nContents\nand time away, including family building benefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans, access to legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, and health and well-being benefits. \nOur health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them reach their personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health, create financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community.\nThe Strength of Our Workforce and People Processes\nIn early 2025, we announced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape. We will continue to work to build an inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve. \nWe want our products to work for people around the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to do that. We remain committed to having a skilled, inclusive and diverse workforce with a broad range of knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, and perspectives because we believe cognitive diversity fuels innovation. To aid in this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias in our people processes and tooling, including our hiring processes and performance management systems. \nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our Family metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled \"\n—\nRevenue\n—\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2024 using 2023 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \"\n—\nLiquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results \nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible. \nOur financial results and key Family metrics for 2024 are set forth below. Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50 billion, an increase of 22% compared to 2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% compared to 2023. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in 2024 increased 11% year-over-year, and our average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year. \nIncome from operations for 2024 was $69.38 billion, an increase of $22.63 billion, or 48%, compared to 2023, driven by an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs.\n59\nTable of \nContents\nConsolidated and Segment Results\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes our virtual, augmented, and mixed reality related consumer hardware, software, and content.\nFamily of Apps\nReality Labs\nTotal\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n% change\n2024\n2023\n% change\n2024\n2023\n% change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nRevenue\n$\n162,355 \n$\n133,006 \n22%\n$\n2,146 \n$\n1,896 \n13%\n$\n164,501 \n$\n134,902 \n22%\nCosts and expenses\n75,246 \n70,135 \n7%\n19,875 \n18,016 \n10%\n95,121 \n88,151 \n8%\nIncome (loss) from operations\n$\n87,109 \n$\n62,871 \n39%\n$\n(17,729)\n$\n(16,120)\n(10)%\n$\n69,380 \n$\n46,751 \n48%\nOperating margin\n54 \n%\n47 \n%\n(826)\n%\n(850)\n%\n42 \n%\n35 \n%\n \n•\nNet income was $62.36 billion, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $23.86 for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $39.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nShare repurchases of our Class A common stock were $29.75 billion and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $77.81 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nLong-term debt was $28.83 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nEffective tax rate was 12% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nHeadcount was 74,067 as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 10% year-over-year. \nDividend \nBeginning in February 2024, we declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2.00 for each share of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024.

We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, European Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and an increasing \n60\nTable of \nContents\nnumber of laws have been introduced limiting or prohibiting the provision of our services to younger users. We expect these and other developments will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue and user engagement. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity obligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we expect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, high interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and macroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in future periods. \nIn addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics, in particular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\n61\nTable of \nContents\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.\nInvestment Philosophy\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our operating efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products that may only be fully realized in the next decade. In 2024, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we continue to expect our RL operating losses to increase in 2025. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our RL efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods. \n62\nTable of \nContents\nTrends in Our Revenue by User Geography \nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results. Our revenue in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe is relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets, and ad impression growth is primarily in geographies that monetize at lower rates, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. In 2024, revenue increased by 18% in United States & Canada, 26% in Europe, 22% in Asia-Pacific, and 31% in Rest of World, in each case relative to 2023.\n-\n \nAd Revenue\nNon-Ad Revenue\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.\n63\nTable of \nContents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP based on their other activities on our Family products. \nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.\n•\nDaily Active People (DAP).\n We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP as a measure of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n------\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\nWorldwide DAP increased 5% to 3.35 billion on average during December 2024 from 3.19 billion during December 2023. \n64\nTable of \nContents\n•\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP).\n \nOur Family of Apps (FoA) revenue represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. We define ARPP as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter.\nARPP:\n$10.68\n$9.47\n$10.42\n$10.93\n$12.33\n$11.20\n$11.89\n$12.29\n$14.25\nAd Revenue\nNon-Ad Revenue\nNote: We updated our definition of ARPP beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and have recast ARPP in prior periods for comparative purposes.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2024, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $49.63, an increase of 15% from 2023.\n65\nTable of \nContents\nTrends in Our Ad Impressions and Average Price Per Ad\n•\nAd Impressions.\n \nOur advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user.\n \n \nNote: Our ad impressions growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered.\n66\nTable of \nContents\n•\nAverage Price Per Ad.\n \nWe calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered.\n \n \nNote: Our average price per ad growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered.\n67\nTable of \nContents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in the future. \nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts that materially differ from management's estimates of losses, it could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. See Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income (loss) before \n68\nTable of \nContents\nprovision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties with our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer pricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of future cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is performed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. For information regarding the change in useful lives of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n69\nTable of \nContents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue \nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising.\n \nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. \nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currently monetized at the same rate as our Feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. \nOther revenue. \nOther revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses \nCost of revenue.\n \nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs. \nResearch and development.\n Research and development expenses consist mostly of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for our employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new technologies and products; RL technology development costs; infrastructure costs; and facilities-related costs. \nMarketing and sales.\n Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions; marketing and promotional expenses; and professional services to support our community and product operations.\nGeneral and administrative.\n General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; and professional services.\n70\nTable of \nContents\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. In 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in all regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the average price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by an increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered. \nOther revenue\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by WhatsApp Business Platform revenue.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2024 increased $250 million, or 13%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to an increase in RL consumer hardware products sold.\nRevenue Seasonality\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17% compared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n72\nTable of \nContents\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue \nChanges in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the full year 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Using these constant rates for full year 2024, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $165.37 billion and $161.51 billion, which were $874 million and $880 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023 % change\n2023 vs 2022 % change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nCost of revenue\n$\n30,161 \n$\n25,959 \n$\n25,249 \n16 \n%\n3 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n18 \n%\n19 \n%\n22 \n%\nCost of revenue in 2024 increased $4.20 billion, or 16%, compared to 2023.

The increase was mostly due to higher employee compensation as well as infrastructure costs for research and development, partially offset by lower restructuring charges.\nThe higher employee compensation was mainly from a 13% growth in employee headcount from 2023 to 2024 in engineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and Reality Labs.\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding restructuring charges.\nMarketing and sales\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023 % change\n2023 vs 2022 % change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nMarketing and sales\n$\n11,347 \n$\n12,301 \n$\n15,262 \n(8)\n%\n(19)\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n7 \n%\n9 \n%\n13 \n%\nMarketing and sales expenses in 2024 decreased $954 million, or 8%, compared to 2023.

The increase in FoA income from operations was driven by higher advertising revenue which was partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, mostly from higher depreciation expense and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs. \nReality Labs\nRL loss from operations in 2024 increased $1.61 billion, or 10%, compared to 2023, driven by an increase in RL costs and expenses. RL costs and expenses increased primarily due to increases in employee compensation and infrastructure costs.\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring, Note 7 — Property and Equipment, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16 — Segment and Geographical Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding restructuring charges, depreciation expense, legal-related costs, and segment employee compensation, respectively.\n74\nTable of \nContents\nInterest and other income (expense), net\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023 % change\n2023 vs 2022 % change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nInterest income\n$\n2,517 \n$\n1,639 \n$\n461 \n54 \n%\n256 \n%\nInterest expense\n(715)\n(446)\n(185)\n(60)\n%\n(141)\n%\nForeign currency exchange losses, net\n(690)\n(366)\n(81)\n(89)\n%\n(352)\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n171 \n(150)\n(320)\n214 \n%\n53 \n%\nTotal interest and other income (expense), net\n$\n1,283 \n$\n677 \n$\n(125)\n90 \n%\nNM\n____________________________________\nNM    - not meaningful\n \nInterest and other income (expense), net in 2024 increased $606 million compared to 2023, mostly due to an increase in interest income from a combination of higher balances and interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on our long-term debt. \nProvision for income taxes\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023 % change\n2023 vs 2022 % change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n8,303 \n$\n8,330 \n$\n5,619 \n— \n%\n48 \n%\nEffective tax rate\n12 \n%\n18 \n%\n19 \n%\nOur provision for income taxes in 2024 decreased $27 million compared to 2023, due to a decrease in the effective tax rate, offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes.\nOur effective tax rate in 2024 decreased compared to 2023, primarily due to excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation and an increase in research tax credits. \nEffective Tax Rate Items.\n Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from capital losses not expected to be utilized, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 24, 2025 price, and absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the range of 12-15%. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2024, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2025 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.\nA number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to evaluate the impacts of proposed and enacted legislation with respect to the global minimum tax regime in the jurisdictions we operate in. As additional jurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.\n75\nTable of \nContents\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had net uncertain tax positions of $9.99 billion which was included in long-term income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months.\nSee Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, investment grade corporate debt securities, and marketable equity securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $77.81 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $12.41 billion from December 31, 2023. The increase was due to $91.33 billion of cash generated from operations and $10.43 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in August 2024. These increases were offset by $39.23 billion of capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, our capital returns of $35.20 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents, and $13.77 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards. \nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n91,328 \n$\n71,113 \n$\n50,475 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(47,150)\n$\n(24,495)\n$\n(28,970)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(40,781)\n$\n(19,500)\n$\n(22,136)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $62.36 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $16.69 billion of share-based compensation expense and $15.50 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2024 compared to 2023, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by higher cash paid for income taxes and other operational spending.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $37.26 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $9.75 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2024 compared to 2023 was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable debt securities and property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 to support our core business and generative AI efforts.\n76\nTable of \nContents\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $30.13 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $5.07 billion of payments of dividends and dividend equivalents, and $13.77 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $10.43 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of additional Notes in August 2024. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2024 compared to 2023, was mostly due to increases in our capital returns of $10.35 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $5.07 billion for quarterly dividend payments that began in March 2024, as well as a $6.76 billion increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nFree Cash Flow \nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business. \nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\n•\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\n•\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n91,328 \n$\n71,113 \n$\n50,475 \nPurchases of property and equipment\n(37,256)\n(27,045)\n(31,186)\nPrincipal payments on finance leases\n(1,969)\n(1,058)\n(850)\nFree cash flow\n$\n52,103 \n$\n43,010 \n$\n18,439 \n77\nTable of \nContents\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our investments in infrastructure and AI initiatives, share repurchases and dividend payments for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices and colocations. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially change our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs from content providers whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion, which mature from 2027 through 2064. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of December 31, 2024 were $1.39 billion and $28.10 billion, respectively. \nCapital Return Program\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $51.28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\nDividend\nWe paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2.00 for each share of Class A and Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents on our outstanding common stock.\nTaxes\nCash paid for income taxes was $10.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had taxes payable of $718 million related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, which is due within one year. \nOur long-term income taxes include $9.99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n78\nTable of \nContents\nSee Note 8 — Leases, Note 10 — Long-term Debt, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, Note 13 — Stockholders' Equity, and Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding leases, debt, contractual commitments and contingencies, capital return program, and taxes, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
