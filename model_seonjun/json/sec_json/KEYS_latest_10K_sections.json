The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about the risks related to government regulations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nEnvironmental Regulations\nOur R&D, manufacturing, and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state, and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental, and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated, and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging, and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal, and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur additional costs in the future.\nSome of our properties have been the subject of ongoing remediation by HP Inc. (“HP”) for subsurface contamination that was known at the time of Agilent’s separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent’s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect to facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014 (the “Separation”). As a result, HP has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and \n12\nTable \nof\n Contents\nvalue of the properties. In connection with the Separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations. On December 17, 2021, Keysight and HP signed a restrictive covenant related to our Santa Rosa facility that prohibits certain uses of the property (such as running a daycare facility, hospital, or school) and terminates HP’s remediation obligation related to that facility. HP’s remediation obligations relating to Keysight’s Colorado Springs facility are ongoing.\nWe maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\nImport/Export Regulations\nWe sell products and solutions to customers all over the world and are required to comply with the U.S Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs that limit or ban sales into certain countries. Countries outside of the U.S. have implemented similar controls and sanction regulations. Together these controls and regulations may impose licensing requirements on exports of certain technology and software from the U.S. and may impact our ability to transact business in certain countries or with certain customers. We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of these programs and regulations, and we regularly monitor changes in the law and regulations.\nOn August 3, 2021, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (\"DTCC\") to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\"). Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we were assessed a penalty of $6.6 million to be paid over three years, $2.5 million of which was suspended and designated for remediation activities over three years, including employment of a special compliance officer. The suspended portion of the penalty was satisfied by amounts spent on qualifying compliance activities. On April 23, 2024, we made the final payment on the penalty, bringing the total amount paid to $4.1 million. On May 3, 2024, we submitted a certification letter to the DTCC certifying that Keysight had implemented all aspects of the Consent Agreement and that Keysight’s compliance program is adequate to identify, prevent, detect, correct, and report violations of the ITAR. On May 22, 2024, the DTCC closed the Consent Agreement based on this certification and their conclusion that Keysight had fulfilled the terms of the Consent Agreement.\nIn February 2022, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions and other restrictions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. As a result, after an initial suspension of operations in Russia, we permanently discontinued our Russian operations and are exiting Russia.\nChanges in these or other import or export laws and regulations may restrict or further restrict our ability to sell certain products and solutions and may require us to develop additional compliance programs and training.\nAnti-Corruption Regulations\nAs a result of our extensive international operations, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs, and training to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory changes that may impact our business and develop strategies to address the changes and incorporate them into existing compliance programs. \nData Privacy Regulations \nWith extensive operations all over the world, we must comply with complex regulations governing data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union and data privacy regulations in other jurisdictions. These regulations require careful handling of internal data. We have internal data handling policies and practices to comply with global data privacy requirements, including GDPR and similar regulations, and devote resources to keep up with changing data privacy regulations. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risk of fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, amendments, or interpretations of regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs related to compliance and may restrict our business operations.\nHealth and Safety Regulations\nWe are subject to and comply with health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations may differ by country, requiring us to keep track of varied and complex requirements. In the U.S. we are subject to federal and state Occupational Health and Safety laws as well as federal, state, and local requirements. \n13\nTable \nof\n Contents\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant \nThe following is information regarding our executive officers as of December 1, 2024.\nSatish Dhanasekaran, \n52, has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Keysight since May 2022.

(“we,” “us,” “Keysight” or the “company”), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a global innovator in the computing, communications and electronics market, committed to advancing our customers’ business success by helping them solve critical challenges in the development and commercialization of their products and services. Our mission, “accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world,” speaks to the value we provide our customers in a world of ever-increasing technological complexity. We deliver this value through a broad range of design and test solutions that address the critical challenges our customers face in bringing their innovations to market on ever-shorter schedules. \nOur fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.\nAcquisition of ESI Group SA\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ESI Group SA (“ESI Group”) for $935 million, net of cash acquired, using existing cash. For the year ended October 31, 2024, our acquisition of ESI Group resulted in incremental revenue of $141 million. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations, we have qualitatively disclosed the impact of the ESI Group acquisition. See Note 2, “Acquisitions,” for additional information.\nMacroeconomic environment\nOur global operations continued to be affected by a challenging macro environment, including higher interest rates, currency movements, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions. These factors resulted in lower demand, as our customers also exercised caution in light of the same environment. Against this backdrop, we remained operationally disciplined by exercising our financial playbook and the structural flexibility in our operating model, while investing to expand our differentiated solutions portfolio and deepening our customer relationships. Consistent with the Keysight Leadership Model, our differentiated first-to-market solutions portfolio, technology leadership, customer relationships, and durable and resilient business model give us confidence in the long-term trajectory of the business and our ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions and deliver consistent long-term value to our customers.\nFor discussion of risks related to potential impacts of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical challenges on our operations, business results and financial condition, see Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors.”\n35\nTable \nof\n Contents\nYears ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nOrders were $5,033 million, $5,190 million, and $5,984 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Orders of $5,033 million for 2024 decreased 3 percent compared to 2023. Acquisitions had a favorable impact of 4 percentage points on the order change for 2024 compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on the order change for 2024 compared to 2023. Orders declined in the Americas and Asia Pacific, while Europe was flat. Orders of $5,190 million for 2023 decreased 13 percent compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the order change for 2023 compared to 2022. Orders declined across all regions, including a double-digit decline in Asia Pacific.\nRevenue was $4,979 million, $5,464 million, and $5,420 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue of $4,979 million for 2024 decreased 9 percent compared to 2023. Acquisitions had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points on the revenue change for 2024 compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on the revenue change for 2024 compared to 2023. Revenue declined in both the Communications Solutions Group (“CSG”) and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (“EISG”). Revenue from CSG and EISG represented approximately 69 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of total revenue for 2024. Revenue of $5,464 million for 2023 increased 1 percent compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on the revenue growth for 2023 compared to 2022. A revenue increase in EISG was partially offset by a decline in CSG. Revenue from CSG and EISG represented approximately 67 percent and 33 percent, respectively, of total revenue for 2023.\nNet income was $614 million, $1,057 million, and $1,124 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net income of $614 million for 2024 decreased 42 percent compared to 2023, primarily driven by lower revenue, higher acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs and amortization of acquisition-related balances, partially offset by lower provision for income taxes, favorable gross margin impact from the ESI Group acquisition and lower people-related costs. Net income of $1,057 million for 2023 decreased 6 percent compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher income tax expense, R&D expense, and selling, general and administrative expense, partially offset by higher interest income, higher revenue, and favorable mix.\nCash flows generated from operating activities were $1,052 million, $1,408 million, and $1,144 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOutlook\nOur first-to-market solutions strategy enables customers to develop new technologies and accelerate innovation and provides a platform for Keysight's long-term growth. Our customers are expected to continue to make R&D investments in certain next-generation technologies and applications, including evolution of 5G, early 6G, high-speed data center networks and infrastructure, satellite networks, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), next generation electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles, industrial internet of things (“IoT”), and defense modernization. We continue to engage actively with our customers, and closely monitor the current macroeconomic environment, including trade, tariffs, monetary and fiscal policies and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth trends of our markets and our ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Exposure\nOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating, investing and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses, and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis. The result of hedging has been included in our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations. We experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities. Our cash flow hedging program is designed to hedge short-term currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.\n36\nTable \nof\n Contents\nResults from Operations - Years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nA summary of our results is as follows:\n \nYear Ended October 31,\n2024 over 2023 \n% Change\n2023 over 2022 \n% Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions, except margin data)\nRevenue\n$\n4,979 \n$\n5,464 \n$\n5,420 \n(9)%\n1%\nProducts\n$\n3,717 \n$\n4,336 \n$\n4,386 \n(14)%\n(1)%\nPercentage of revenue\n75 \n%\n79 \n%\n81 \n%\n(5) ppts\n(2) ppts\nServices and other\n$\n1,262 \n$\n1,128 \n$\n1,034 \n12%\n9%\nPercentage of revenue\n25 \n%\n21 \n%\n19 \n%\n5 ppts\n2 ppts\nGross margin\n62.9 \n%\n64.6 \n%\n63.7 \n%\n(2) ppts\n1 ppt\nProducts\n60.9 \n%\n64.2 \n%\n63.3 \n%\n(3) ppts\n1 ppt\nServices and other\n68.8 \n%\n66.3 \n%\n64.9 \n%\n2 ppts\n1 ppt\nResearch and development\n$\n919 \n$\n882 \n$\n841 \n4%\n5%\nPercentage of revenue\n18 \n%\n16 \n%\n16 \n%\n2 ppts\n1 ppt\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n1,395 \n$\n1,307 \n$\n1,283 \n7%\n2%\nPercentage of revenue\n28 \n%\n24 \n%\n24 \n%\n4 ppts\n—\nOther operating expense (income), net\n$\n(14)\n$\n(15)\n$\n(8)\n(6)%\n80%\nIncome from operations\n$\n833 \n$\n1,358 \n$\n1,334 \n(39)%\n2%\nOperating margin\n16.7 \n%\n24.8 \n%\n24.6 \n%\n(8) ppts\n—\nInterest income\n$\n81 \n$\n102 \n$\n16 \n(20)%\n518%\nInterest expense\n$\n(84)\n$\n(78)\n$\n(79)\n9%\n(1)%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n35 \n$\n(25)\n$\n14 \n— \n— \nIncome before taxes\n$\n865 \n$\n1,357 \n$\n1,285 \n(36)%\n6%\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n251 \n$\n300 \n$\n161 \n(17)%\n87%\nNet income\n$\n614 \n$\n1,057 \n$\n1,124 \n(42)%\n(6)%\nRevenue\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.

Gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by \nprice increases and favorable mix, partially offset by higher warranty costs.\n37\nTable \nof\n Contents\nExcess and obsolete inventory charges were $35 million in 2024, $27 million in 2023, and $27 million in 2022.\nR&D expense increased 4 percent in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by\n incremental costs from acquired businesses, parti\nally offset by lower variable people-related costs. We continued to prudently prioritize investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leading-edge technologies. R&D expense increased 5 percent in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by investments in key growth opportunities, partially offset by lower variable people-related costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 7 percent in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher acquisition and integration costs, incremental costs from acquired businesses, higher amortization of acquisition-related balances, partially offset by lower people-related, marketing, and infrastructure costs resulting from the flexibility of our operating model and cost efficiency measures. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher infrastructure-related, restructuring, and travel-related costs, partially offset by lower sales commission and variable people-related costs.\nOther operating expense (income) was income of $14 million, $15 million, and $8 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and primarily include property rental income. During fiscal year 2022, other operating expense (income) included asset impairment charges of $7 million related to the discontinuance of our Russia operations.\nOperating margin decreased 8 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher selling, general and administrative and R&D expenses on lower revenue coupled with gross margin declines. Operating margin was flat in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by gross margin gains offset by higher R&D expenses as a percentage of sales.\nInterest income for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $81 million, $102 million, and $16 million, respectively, and primarily related to interest earned on our cash balances. The decline in interest income in fiscal 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by decline in year-over-year cash balances. The increase in interest income in fiscal 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in interest rates and higher year-over-year cash balances. Interest expense for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $84 million, $78 million, and $79 million, respectively, and primarily related to interest on our senior notes. Interest expense for 2024, included amortization of debt issuance costs of $4 million related to the bridge credit agreement. See Note 9, “Derivatives,” and Note 11,”Debt,” for additional information.\nOther income (expense) for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was income of $35 million, expense of $25 million, and income of $14 million, respectively, and primarily include net income related to our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans (interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service credits, and gains (losses) on settlements and curtailments), gains (losses) due to currency and derivative instruments, and the change in fair value of our equity investments. The increase in net other income for 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by gains on derivative instruments and higher net gains on our equity investments, partially offset by an increase in pension costs due to higher interest cost on benefit obligations. The increase in net other expense for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by losses on derivative instruments and higher amortization of net actuarial losses, partially offset by net gains on our equity investments.\nOur headcount was approximately 15,500 as of October 31, 2024, compared to approximately 14,900 as of October 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, partially offset by reductions from our cost efficiency measures.\nIncome Taxes \n \nYear Ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions, except percentages)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n251 \n$\n300 \n$\n161 \nEffective tax rate\n29 \n%\n22 \n%\n13 \n%\nThe effective tax rate was 29 percent, 22 percent, and 13 percent for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nThe tax rate in 2024 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a one-time income tax charge of $315 million required to adjust Singapore deferred tax asset values to an incentive tax rate. Keysight entered into a new Singapore tax incentive agreement effective August 1, 2024. The Singapore tax incentive provides lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and requires thresholds of investments and employment. \nThe 2024 income tax charge was partially offset by a one-time income tax benefit of $165 million related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax deductions for intangible asset amortization. Keysight concluded that the U.S. Department of the Treasury exceeded its regulatory authority in issuing tax regulations disallowing these deductions under IRC § 951A. The company amended its U.S. federal income tax returns for the open tax years to claim GILTI tax deductions. The \n38\nTable \nof\n Contents\ntax receivable resulting from the amended returns is reflected in “other assets” and “other current assets” in the consolidated balance sheet. The annual tax impact of the amortization of the intangible assets will continue to be recognized until 2033. The company believes the position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold and intends to vigorously defend its position. The outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded. \nThe 2024 income tax charge was also partially offset by a one-time income tax benefit of $61 million for the release of tax reserves related to the successful appeal of a Malaysia income tax assessment. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Keysight was assessed and paid income tax and penalties in Malaysia on gains related to the transfer of intellectual property rights and recorded a tax reserve on the assessed amount. The Court of Appeal in Malaysia ruled in Keysight’s favor on May 24, 2024, and the company received a refund of the income tax and penalties. \nThe 7 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to these one-time income tax items in 2024.\nThe tax rate in 2023 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax capitalization of research and experimental expenditures, partially offset by the net impact from the proportion of worldwide earnings taxed at lower statutory tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions and the U.S. tax imposed on those non-U.S. earnings. The tax rate in 2022 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of worldwide earnings that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions, partially offset by U.S. tax imposed on earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions. The increase in the effective tax rate of 9 percent from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to a 5 percent increase from U.S. tax capitalization of research and experimental expenditures in 2023.\nKeysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia. The tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. The Malaysia tax incentive expires October 31, 2025. The Singapore tax incentive expires July 31, 2029. \nThe open tax years for the U.S. federal income tax return and most state income tax returns are from November 1, 2019 through the current tax year. For the majority of our non-U.S. entities, the open tax years are from November 1, 2019 through the current tax year.\nAt this time, management does not believe that the outcome of any future or currently ongoing examination will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with management’s current expectations. If that were to occur, it could have an impact on our effective tax rate in the period in which such examinations are resolved.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds requires significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various other countries globally. Changes in tax law, tax rates, or in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates may affect deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded and our future effective tax rate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) reached agreement among various countries to implement a minimum 15 percent tax rate on certain multinational enterprises, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two model rules. A subset of the rules will be effective for Keysight as of November 1, 2024, with the remaining rules effective as of November 1, 2025. Keysight continues to analyze the Pillar Two model rules and monitor developments. Pillar Two could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2025, primarily offsetting the reduction to our effective income tax rate from our tax incentives. \nWe do not recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to impact the GILTI tax expense in future years. We recognize the tax expense related to GILTI in each year in which the tax is incurred.\n39\nTable \nof\n Contents\nSegment Overview\n We have two reportable operating segments, CSG and EISG. The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related balances, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, interest income, interest expense and other items.\nCommunications Solutions Group (“CSG”)\nCSG serves customers spanning the global commercial communications and aerospace, defense, and government end markets.

Revenue declined across all regions and in both the commercial communications and the aerospace, defense, and government end markets.\n The decline was driven primarily by lower customer demand as compared to last year, which benefited from robust backlog conversion. Our customers continued to make R&D investments in next-generation technologies and applications, including AI-driven data center expansion, ongoing 5G standards development and deployment, 400G/800G/terabit Ethernet, development of new communications technologies (e.g., 6G, Open Radio Access Networks, commercial non-terrestrial networks, and quantum), high-speed networking and major defense and government programs worldwide\n. CSG revenue for 2023 decreased 3 percent compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on year-over-year revenue change. Revenue declined in Asia Pacific and the Americas were partially offset by an increase in Europe. A revenue decline in the commercial communications end market was partially offset by growth in the aerospace, defense, and government end market.\nRevenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 66 percent of total CSG revenue in 2024 and decreased 7 percent compared to 2023. Revenue declined across all regions.\n T\nhe year-over-year decline in revenue was primarily driven by continued weakness in the wireless communications ecosystem, particularly smartphones, partially offset by higher investments in AI Workload Emulation tools and infrastructure solutions. \nWe continued to see investments in high-speed networks due to increasing need for AI capabilities in the data center infrastructure ecosystem, which was driving demand for our 400G/800G/terabit Ethernet solutions, both in R&D and manufacturing. \nRevenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 66 percent of total CSG revenue in 2023 and decreased 7 percent compared to 2022.

Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Under certain circumstances, U.S. and local government regulations may limit our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs.\nOverview of Cash Flows\nOur key cash flow activities were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,052 \n$\n1,408 \n$\n1,144 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(819)\n$\n(288)\n$\n(251)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(913)\n$\n(687)\n$\n(861)\n42\nTable \nof\n Contents\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs, the timing of payments for income taxes, variable pay, pension funding, and other items impact reported cash flows. \nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $356 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $264 million in 2023 compared to 2022.\n•    Net income in 2024 decreased $443 million compared to 2023. Non-cash adjustments to net income were higher by $339 million, primarily due to a $271 million increase in deferred tax expense resulting from a one-time income tax charge of $315 million to decrease deferred tax asset values from the Singapore statutory tax rate to an incentive tax rate (see Note 5, “Income Taxes,” for additional information), a $58 million increase in amortization and depreciation expense, a $8 million increase in excess and obsolete inventory related charges, and a $2 million increase in share-based compensation.\nNet income in 2023 decreased $67 million compared to 2022. Non-cash adjustments to net income were lower by $54 million, primarily due to a $36 million increase in unrealized gains on equity and other investments, a $14 million decrease in amortization, a $10 million increase in deferred tax benefit, and a $7 million decrease in other non-cash adjustments, which was primarily driven by prior year one-time asset impairment charges related to the discontinuance of our Russia operations, partially offset by a $10 million increase in share-based compensation, and a $3 million increase in depreciation expense.\n•    The aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable provided net cash of $48 million during 2024, compared to net cash used of $196 million in 2023 and $273 million in 2022. The increase in aggregate net cash provided in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily driven by a lower increase in inventory, lower payments, and timing of collections relative to revenue. The decrease in aggregate net cash used in 2023 compared to 2022 is primarily driven by higher collections, net of payments, partially offset by an increase in inventory driven by an incremental stock build-up to secure supply to support order fulfillment along with an increase in demo inventory. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable depends on the cash conversion cycle, which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of shipments and purchases, as well as collections and payments in a period.\n•\nThe aggregate of tax receivables used net cash of $202 million during 2024, compared to net cash used of $4 million in 2023 and $30 million in 2022. In fiscal 2024 tax receivables are higher primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $165 million recorded as a current and long-term tax receivable in the consolidated balance sheet related to the U.S. intangible asset amortization deduction for purposes of determining income or loss under IRC § 951A(c) and the amendment of our U.S. federal income tax returns for the open tax years to claim the deduction. See Note 5, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.\n•\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023, we terminated forward-starting interest rate swap agreements resulting in proceeds of $107 million. See Note 9, “Derivatives,” for additional information.\n•\nThe aggregate other movements in assets and liabilities used net cash of $117 million during 2024, compared to net cash provided of $74 million in 2023 and net cash used of $101 million in 2022. The difference between 2024 and 2023 cash flows was primarily due to payments on settlement of foreign exchange forward contracts associated with the ESI Group acquisition, net unrealized gains on foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, (see Note 9, “Derivatives”), changes in deferred revenue, and changes in other assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher income and other tax accruals, net of payments, lower variable compensation, and payroll-related payments, net of accruals. \nThe difference between 2023 and 2022 cash flows is primarily due to lower prepaid inventory deposits driven by easing of supply chain constraints and other lower prepaid expenses, unrealized loss on foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, and changes in other assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher income tax payments, net of accruals, higher variable compensation and other payroll-related payments, net of accruals, and changes in deferred revenue.\n43\nTable \nof\n Contents\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash changes in investing activities primarily relates to investments in property, plant and equipment and acquisitions of businesses to support our growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $531 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased by $37 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to $596 million higher cash used for acquisition activities, partially offset by a $49 million decrease in cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of government incentives received. In 2024, we used $681 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, which included $477 million, net of $35 million cash acquired, for the acquisition of the controlling block of ESI Group shares. Additionally, we used $147 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of $7 million of government incentives and $11 million for equity and other investments, partially offset by $20 million provided by other investing activities.\nIn 2023, we used $288 million for investing activities, including $196 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of government incentives; $85 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisition activities; and $7 million for purchase of investments.\nIn 2022, we used $251 million for investing activities, including $185 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment; $33 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisition activities; and $33 million for purchase of investments.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities primarily include proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, issuances and repayment of debt and related costs, treasury stock repurchases, and transactions with non-controlling interests in partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $226 million in 2024 compared to 2023, and decreased by $174 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in net cash used in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to $458 million used for the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in ESI Group, partially offset by $259 million lower treasury stock repurchases.\nIn 2024, we used $913 million for financing activities, including $600 million used for repayment of the 2024 Senior Notes, $458 million used for the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in ESI Group, $443 million used for treasury stock repurchases, including payment of $4 million for excise taxes levied on share repurchases, $31 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, $24 million used for repayment of debt assumed as part of the ESI Group acquisition, $12 million used for payment of debt issuance costs, and $10 million used for other financing activities, partially offset by $599 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Senior Notes, and $66\n million\n of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.\nIn 2023, we used $687 million for financing activities, including $702 million for treasury stock repurchases and $49 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by \n$67 million\n of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.\nIn 2022, we used $861 million for financing activities, including $849 million for treasury stock repurchases and $74 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $63 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.\nTreasury stock repurchases\nOn March 6, 2023, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1,500 million of the company’s common stock, of which $485 million remained as of October 31, 2024. The stock repurchase program may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time at the company’s discretion and does not have an expiration date.

On February 17, 2023, we entered into the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility to change the annual interest rate from LIBOR + 1 percent to SOFR + 1.1 percent. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility permits the company, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions to request to increase the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $250 million in the aggregate. We may use amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended October 31, 2024. See Note 11, “Debt,” for additional information.\nBridge Facility\n \nOn March 28, 2024, we entered into a bridge credit agreement (the “Bridge Facility”) pursuant to which certain lenders agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge credit facility of up to 1,350 million pounds sterling for the purpose of providing the financing to support a planned acquisition. On July 25, 2024, the Bridge Facility was decreased to 1,232 million \n45\nTable \nof\n Contents\npounds sterling. We incurred costs in connection with the Bridge Facility of $7 million that are included in “other current assets” in the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Bridge Facility. \nESI Group debt and credit facility assumed \nAs part of the ESI Group acquisition, we assumed debt of $24 million, of which $10 million was payable within one year. The debt included a syndicated loan of $11 million payable through yearly installments until April 2025 with an annual interest rate of EURIBOR + 2 to 2.5 percent. We also assumed various fixed interest rate state-guaranteed loans and other bank borrowings of $13 million. During the year ended October 31, 2024, we repaid the debt assumed as part of the acquisition. \nAs part of the ESI Group acquisition, we assumed a revolving credit facility of 10 million euros that was subsequently terminated in April 2024.\nSee Note 11, “Debt,” for additional information.\nCash and cash requirements\nCash\nOctober 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n1,814 \n$\n2,488 \nU.S.\n$\n626 \n$\n362 \nNon-U.S.\n$\n1,188 \n$\n2,126 \nOur cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of investments in institutional money market funds, short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Most significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cash pool for working capital needs. In addition, a few locations that are unable to access internal funding have access to temporary local overdraft and short-term working capital lines of credit.\nCash requirements\nWe have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. \nW\ne generally intend to use available cash and funds generated from our operations to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, we may also borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn March 28, 2024, we announced our intention to acquire the entire share capital of Spirent Communications PLC (“Spirent”) for cash consideration of 199 pence per Spirent share, which reflects a valuation of $1,463 million on a fully diluted basis. Spirent shareholders will also be entitled to receive a special dividend of 2.5 pence per Spirent share, in lieu of any final dividend for the year ended December 31, 2023 (together with the cash consideration of 199 pence per share). The acquisition is expected to be completed during the first half of fiscal year 2025, pending regulatory clearances.\nOn September 19, 2024, Keysight announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”) to acquire Synopsys’ Optical Solutions Group, a leading developer of optical design and analysis software tools. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including review by regulatory authorities and the successful closing of Synopsys’ proposed acquisition of Ansys, which is pending regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\n46\nTable \nof\n Contents\nThe following table summarizes our short and long-term cash requirements as of October 31, 2024:\nTotal\nDue within one\nyear \nDue later than one\nyear \n(in millions)\nSenior notes obligations\n$\n1,800 \n$\n— \n$\n1,800 \nInterest payments on senior notes\n453 \n77 \n376 \nOperating lease commitments\n270 \n51 \n219 \nCommitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers\n465 \n456 \n9 \nOther purchase commitments\n96 \n42 \n54 \nOther liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet\n1,797 \n1,046 \n751 \nTotal\n$\n4,881 \n$\n1,672 \n$\n3,209 \nSenior notes obligations and interest payments on senior notes. \nWe have contractual obligations for principal and interest payments on our senior notes. See Note 11, “Debt,” for additional information.\nOperating lease commitments.\n Commitments under operating leases primarily relates to leasehold properties. See Note 10, “Leases,” for additional information.\nCommitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers. \nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional information. As of October 31, 2024, we had non-cancellable purchase commitments that aggregated $423 million, of which the majority is for less than one year.\nOther purchase commitments.\n Other purchase commitments primarily relate to software as a service and other professional services contracts. \nWe also have long-term power purchase agreements to purchase power at predominantly variable prices. These agreements are expected to support our power consumption needs with more favorable pricing and reliability than our previous supply agreements. See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional information.\nOther liabilities. \nOther liabilities primarily include contract liabilities, net pension and post-retirement benefit obligations, employee compensation and benefits, net tax liabilities, standard warranties and other accrued liabilities. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based on historical experience.\nOf the tax liabilities included in the above table, $20 million relates to a U.S. transition tax liability and $200 million for uncertain tax positions. The remaining U.S. transition tax liability, which Keysight originally elected to pay over 8 years, is payable over the next 3 years and relates to a one-time U.S. tax on those earnings that had not been previously repatriated to the U.S. With regard to the $200 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. We believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with management’s current expectations. See Note 5, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.\nIn addition to the obligations noted above, as of October 31, 2024, we had $43 million of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that were issued by various lenders.\nFor the next twelve months, we do not expect to contribute to our U.S. defined benefit plan and U.S. post-retirement benefit plan, and we expect to contribute $13 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans. The ultimate amounts we may contribute depend on, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates, and other factors. See Note 12, “Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans,” for additional information.\nAdditionally, we expect capital spending to be approximately $150 million in 2025, compared to $147 million in 2024.\nAs of October 31, 2024, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future both globally and domestically.\n47\nTable \nof\n Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of October 31, 2024. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective, or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, business combinations, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, warranty, loss contingencies, restructuring, and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue recognition.\n Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We primarily generate revenue from the sale of products (hardware and/or software), services, or a combination thereof. We enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). We recognize revenue following a five-step model.\n1.\nIdentify the contract with a customer:\n Generally, we consider customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales or other purchase agreements, to be the customer contract. All of the following criteria must be met before we consider an agreement to qualify as a contract with a customer under the revenue standard: (i) it must be approved by all parties; (ii) each party’s rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred can be identified; (iii) the payment terms for the goods and services can be identified; (iv) the agreement has commercial substance; and, (v) the customer has the ability and intent to pay and collection of substantially all of the consideration is probable. We exercise reasonable judgment to determine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based upon various factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or credit and financial information and credit risk management measures that we implement.\n2.\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract: \nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the various performance obligations in each contract. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and, (ii) our promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable or distinct from other promises in the contract.\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price: \nTransaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services. Our contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price including rebates, rights of return, trade-in credits, and discounts. Variable consideration is generally accounted for at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information.\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract:\n \nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations with a combination of distinct products and services, maintenance and support, professional services and/or training. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction value to each distinct performance obligation based on relative SSP. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately under similar circumstances to similar customers. Since most contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we use information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate SSP when we do not have standalone transactions.\n5.\nRecognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied: \nRevenue is recognized at the point in time control is transferred to the customer. For hardware sales, transfer of control to the customer typically occurs at the point the product is shipped or delivered to the customer’s designated location. For software license sales, transfer of control to the customer typically occurs upon shipment, electronic delivery, or when the software is available for download by the customer. For sales of implementation service and custom solutions or in instances where products are sold along with essential installation services, transfer of control occurs and revenue is typically recognized upon customer acceptance. For fixed-price support and extended warranty contracts, or certain software arrangements that \n48\nTable \nof\n Contents\nprovide customers with a right to access over a discrete period, control is deemed to transfer over time and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term due to the stand-ready nature of the performance obligation. Revenue from hardware repairs and calibration services outside of an extended warranty or support contract is recognized at the time of completion of the related service. For other professional services or time-based labor contracts, revenue is recognized as we perform the services and the customer receives and/or consume the benefits.\nInventory valuation.\n We assess the valuation of our inventory periodically and adjust the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on future demand and actual usage. The excess balance determined by this analysis serves as the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analyzing sales unit forecasts, managing product rollovers, and collaborating with manufacturing to maximize the recovery of excess inventory, taking actual market and economic conditions into consideration.\nShare-based compensation.\n We account for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors. Awards granted under the Long-Term Performance (“the LTP”) Program are based on a variety of targets, such as total shareholder return (“TSR”) or financial metrics such as operating margin. The awards based on TSR were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of Keysight’s common stock on the date of grant. The compensation cost for financial metrics-based performance awards reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For additional information on valuation assumptions, see Note 4, “Share-Based Compensation.” The estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of Keysight’s common stock on the date of grant. We did not grant any option awards in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRetirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.\n Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Defined benefit plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of October 31, based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect the future benefit costs over the employees’ average expected future service to Keysight based on the terms of the plans. To estimate the present value of these future payments, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The discount rate is a critical assumption. Other important assumptions include expected long-term return on plan assets, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. See Note 12, “Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.”\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date, which is October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates. In addition, we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost: service cost and interest cost. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be $6 million on U.S. net periodic benefit cost and $13 million on non-U.S. net periodic benefit cost. Lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense.\nThe company uses alternate methods of amortization, as allowed by the authoritative guidance, that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. For most non-U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year’s gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $7 million on U.S. net periodic benefit cost and $8 million on non-U.S. net periodic benefit cost.\nBusiness combinations. \nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, which involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments, which are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. We determine the estimated fair values with the assistance of valuations performed by third party specialists, discounted cash flow analysis, and estimates made by management. Our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value estimates may be affected by changes in our financial condition, financial performance, or business strategies. Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable \n49\nTable \nof\n Contents\nmarket data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustment to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets.\n We review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. At the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\nCompanies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.\nThe quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit from the results derived using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted accordingly. The income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, revenue growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method, which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach. \nBased on the results of our \nqualitative\n testing, we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. \nThere were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies, trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and backlog and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 12 years. We review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. No impairments of amortizable intangible assets were recorded during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. The authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) intangible assets. No impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets were recorded in 2024. We had no IPR&D intangible assets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWarranty.\n Keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year. Warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on \n50\nTable \nof\n Contents\nhistorical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within “cost of products” at the time related product revenue is recognized.\nWe also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term. Revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period.\nLoss Contingencies. \nAs discussed in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements, we are, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). We recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.\nRestructuring. \nThe main component of our existing restructuring plans is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.\nAccounting for income taxes.\n We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax benefits, credits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.\nSignificant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. \nAs of October 31, 2024, the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to net operating losses in Luxembourg, capital losses and net operating losses in the U.K., and California research credits from acquired entities that are subject to change in ownership limitations. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1, “Overview, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.\n51\nTable \nof\n Contents",
