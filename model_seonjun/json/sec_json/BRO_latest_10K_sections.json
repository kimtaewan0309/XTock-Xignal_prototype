Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\n Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nCompany Overview\n\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to those Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In addition, see “Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below regarding important information on non-GAAP financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis.\n\n\nWe are a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and services headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. As an insurance intermediary, our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, fees paid directly by customers. Commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units,” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales or payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. We also participate in capitalized captive insurance facilities (the \"Captives\") for the purpose of having additional capacity to place coverage, drive additional revenues and to participate in underwriting results. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain of our MGUs and limit the Company's exposure to claims expenses through reinsurance or by only participating in certain tranches of the underwriting.\n\n\nWe have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2024, with the exception of 2009, when our revenues declined 1.0%. Our revenues grew from $95.6 million in 1993 to $4.8 billion in 2024, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. In the same 31-year period, we increased net income from $8.1 million to $1.0 billion in 2024, a 16.8% compound annual growth rate.\n\n\nThe volume of business from new and existing customers, fluctuations in insurable exposure units, changes in premium rate levels, changes in general economic and competitive conditions, a reduction of purchased limits or the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues. For example, higher levels of inflation, an increase the value of insurable exposure units, or a general decline in economic activity, could increase or decrease the value of insurable exposure units. Conversely, increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage. Historically, we have grown our revenues as a result of our focus on new business, customer retention and acquisitions. We foster a strong, decentralized sales and service culture, which enables responsiveness to changing business conditions and drives accountability for results.\n\n\nThe term “core commissions and fees” excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions, and therefore, it represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold, and specific fee-based services rendered. The net change in core commissions and fees reflects the aggregate changes attributable to: (i) net new and lost accounts; (ii) net changes in our customers’ exposure units, deductibles or insured limits; (iii) net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners; (iv) the net change in fees paid to us by our customers; and (v) any businesses acquired or disposed of.\n\n\nWe also earn profit-sharing contingent commissions, which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results, but in select situations may reflect additional considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. These commissions, which are included in our commissions and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income, are estimated and accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and knowledge, to the extent it is available, of losses incurred. Payments are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each subsequent year, based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior year(s), but may differ from the amount estimated and accrued due to the lack of complete visibility regarding loss information until they are received. Over the last three years, profit-sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 3.6% of commissions and fees revenue.\n\n\nFee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers, and for fees negotiated in lieu of commissions. Fee revenues are generated by: (i) our Programs and Wholesale Brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers and (ii) our Retail segment in our large-account customer base, where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers, in our F&I businesses where we earn fees for assisting our customers with creating and selling warranty and service risk management programs and fees for Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability services and Medicare benefits advocacy services. Fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees, represented 21.1% in 2024 and 23.9% in 2023.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our commissions and fees growth rate was 12.1% and our consolidated Organic Revenue growth rate was 10.4%.\n\n\nHistorically, investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted, on premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies. Our policy as it relates to the Company’s capital is to invest available funds in high-quality, short-term money-market funds and fixed income investment securities. Investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments. Other income primarily reflects other miscellaneous revenues.\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by $157 million, or 13.7% over 2023, driven by Organic Revenue growth, increased profit-sharing contingent commissions, leveraging our expense base, net new business, increased investment income, acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. This was partially offset by a decrease in the gain on disposal primarily associated with the divestiture of certain businesses within the former Services segment during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nIn the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide references to the following non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the SEC rules: Organic Revenue, EBITDAC, EBITDAC Margin, EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted. We present these measures because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community. We believe they provide additional meaningful methods to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from period to period. These measures of operating performance may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis due to the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability, that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance and that are not easily comparable from period to period. This non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company’s consolidated income statements and balance sheets as of the relevant date. Consistent with Regulation G, a description of such information is provided below and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP information are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Results of Operations - Segment Information.”\n\n\nWe view Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue growth as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our three segments, because they allow us to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year, and that are expected to continue in the future. We also view EBITDAC, EBITDAC - Adjusted, EBITDAC Margin and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance, as they present more comparable measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner. As disclosed in our most recent proxy statement, we use Organic Revenue growth, and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted as key performance metrics for our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans for executive officers and other key employees.\n\n\nBeginning January 1, 2024, we no longer exclude Foreign Currency Translation from the calculation of EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted. Prior periods are presented on the same basis so that the calculations of EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted are comparable for both periods. We no longer exclude Foreign Currency Translation from the calculation of these earnings measures because fluctuations in Foreign Currency Translation affect both our revenues and expenses, largely offsetting each other. Therefore, excluding Foreign Currency Translation from these earnings measures provides no meaningful incremental value in evaluating our financial performance.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNon-GAAP Revenue Measures\n\n\n•\nOrganic Revenue\n is our core commissions and fees less: (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newly acquired operations; (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period) and (iii) Foreign Currency Translation (as defined below). The term “core commissions and fees” excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific fee-based services rendered. Organic Revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing Organic Revenue growth. \n\n\n \n\n\nNon-GAAP Earnings Measures\n\n\n•\nEBITDAC\n is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.\n\n\n•\nEBITDAC Margin\n is defined as EBITDAC divided by total revenues. \n\n\n•\nEBITDAC - Adjusted\n is defined as EBITDAC, excluding (i) (gain)/loss on disposal, (ii) for 2022 and 2023, Acquisition/Integration Costs (as defined below) and (iii) for 2023, the 1Q23 Nonrecurring Cost (as defined below).\n\n\n•\nEBITDAC Margin - Adjusted\n is defined as EBITDAC - Adjusted divided by total revenues.\n\n\n \n\n\nDefinitions Related to Certain Components of Non-GAAP Measures\n \n\n\n•\n“Acquisition/Integration Costs”\n means the acquisition and integration costs (e.g., costs associated with regulatory filings, legal/accounting services, due diligence and the costs of integrating our information technology systems) arising out of our acquisitions of GRP (Jersey) Holdco Limited and its business, Orchid Underwriters Agency and CrossCover Insurance Services, and BdB Limited companies, which are not considered to be normal, recurring or part of the ongoing operations.\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n“Foreign Currency Translation” \nmeans the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, which is calculated by applying current-year foreign exchange rates to the various functional currencies in our business to our reporting currency of U.S. dollars for the same period in the prior year.\n\n\n•\n“1Q23 Nonrecurring Cost” \nmeans approximately $11.0 million expensed and substantially paid in the first quarter of 2023 to resolve a business matter, which is not considered to be normal, recurring or part of the ongoing operations.\n\n\n•\n“(Gain)/loss on disposal”\n is a caption on our consolidated statements of income which reflects net proceeds received as compared to net book value related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions, such as the disposal of a business through sale or closure.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments; and therefore, comparability may be limited. This supplemental non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company\n'\ns Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nAcquisitions\n\n\nPart of our business strategy is to attract high-quality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations. From 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired 676 insurance intermediary operations.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, which are based upon a combination of historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues, expenses, carrying values of our assets and liabilities, of which values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n\nWe believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies, the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and purchase price allocations, intangible asset impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation and reserves for litigation. In particular, the accounting for these areas is subject to uncertainty, because it requires significant use of judgment to be made by management. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.\n \n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nThe majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers, acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk; and conversely, acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums. In the majority of these arrangements, our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy; as such, that is when the associated revenue is recognized. In some arrangements, where we are compensated through commissions, we also perform other services for our customer beyond binding of coverage. In those arrangements we apportion the commission between binding of coverage and other services based on their relative fair value and recognize the associated revenue as those performance obligations are satisfied. Where the Company’s performance obligations have been completed, but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors, we estimate the amount of such compensation. We refine those estimates upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement, whichever occurs first.\n\n\nTo a lesser extent, the Company earns revenues in the form of fees. Like commissions, fees paid to us in lieu of commission, are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy. When we are paid a fee for service; however, the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work, which characterizes most of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our property and casualty, and employee benefits practices. Other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreed-upon services to the customer.\n\n\nTo a much lesser extent, the Company earns revenues in the form of net retained earned premiums in connection with the Captives. These premiums are reported net of the ceded premiums for reinsurance and recognized ratably over the associated policy periods.\n\n\nManagement determines a cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances.\n\n\nSee Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues.\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBusiness Combinations and Purchase Price Allocations\n\n\nWe have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses. These assets primarily consist of purchased customer accounts and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). The determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges.\n\n\nIn connection with acquisitions, we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which primarily consist of purchased customer accounts. Purchased customer accounts include the right to represent insureds or claimants supported by the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies, customers and other matters essential to policy renewals of delivery of services. Their value primarily represents the present value of the underlying net cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future duration of the acquired customer relationships. The valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency, expenses and discount rates. Any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts. Purchased customer accounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives, generally 15 years. The excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized.\n\n\nThe recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions, where an earn-out is part of the negotiated transaction. Subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income as a result of updated expectations for the performance of the associated business.\n\n\nThe fair value of earn-out obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements. In determining fair value, the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business, and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. The expected future payments are estimated based on the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. These estimates are then discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecast earn-out payments will be made.\n\n\nIntangible Assets Impairment\n\n\nGoodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, measured by a fair-value-based test. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. To determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment, or as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is not determined that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying amount, the Company will calculate the fair value of the reporting unit for comparison against the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings, or on a discounted cash flow basis.\n\n\nManagement assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Any of the following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) a significant negative industry or economic trend, and (iii) a significant decline in our market capitalization. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-referenced factors, an impairment analysis is performed. Management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to revise the assessment and, if appropriate, record an impairment charge. We completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of November 30, 2024 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets. Additionally, there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n\nNon-Cash Stock-Based Compensation\n\n\nWe grant non-vested stock awards to our employees, with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards, subject to any performance modification. During the performance measurement period, we review the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with our performance awards and adjust the expense recognition accruals with the expected performance\n \noutcome.\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the performance conditions for approximately 970,000 shares of the Company’s common stock granted under the Company’s 2019 SIP were determined by the Compensation Committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2020 and 2022. These grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on December 31, 2022. The vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2020 grant date and four years from the 2022 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. As a result of the awarding of these shares, the\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ngrantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. The awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the performance conditions for approximately 1.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock granted under the Company’s 2019 SIP were determined by the Compensation Committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2021 and 2023. These grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on December 31, 2023. The vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2021 grant date and four years from the 2023 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. As a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. The awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the performance conditions for approximately 1 million shares of the Company’s common stock granted under the Company’s 2019 SIP are expected to be determined by the Compensation Committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2022. These grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on December 31, 2024. The vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2022 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. As a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. The awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.\n\n\nLitigation and Claims\n\n\nWe are subject to numerous litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. If it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable, an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income as incurred. Management, with the assistance of in-house and outside counsel, determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues.

Core commissions and fees in 2024 increased $470 million, composed of (i) approximately $415 million of net new and renewal business, which reflects an Organic Revenue growth rate of 10.4%; (ii) $146 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; (iii) an increase from the impact of Foreign Currency Translation of $10 million and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $101 million related to commissions and fees revenue from businesses or books of business divested in the preceding twelve months. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2024 increased by $36 million, or 27.7%, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven primarily by (i) improved underwriting results, overall growth of the business, as well as qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions that we did not qualify for in the prior year and (ii) recent acquisitions.\n\n\nInvestment Income\n\n\nInvestment income for 2024 was $93 million, compared with $52 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher average interest rates and cash balances compared to 2023.\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Income, Net\n\n\nOther income for 2024 was $7 million, compared with $6 million in 2023. Other income consists of miscellaneous income and therefore, it can fluctuate between comparable periods.\n\n\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\n\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 50.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023, and increased 10.0%, or $219 million. This increase included $69 million of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. Therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2024 and 2023 increased by $150 million, or 6.9%. This underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to: (i) an increase in staff costs attributable to new hires; (ii) an increase in producer compensation associated with revenue growth; (iii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation driven by the strong financial performance of the Company and (iv) the year-over-year increase of approximately $21 million in the value of deferred compensation liabilities driven by changes in the market prices of our deferred compensation plan, with such amount substantially offset within other operating expenses as we hold assets to fund these liabilities, partially offset by (v) employee compensation and benefits associated with certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses divested in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\nOther Operating Expenses\n\n\nOther operating expenses represented 14.8% of total revenues for 2024 as compared to 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other operating expenses for 2024 increased $60 million, or 9.2%, from the same period of 2023. This change includes: (i) $27 million of other operating expenses related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2023; (ii) increased information technology-related costs; (iii) and to a lesser extent, increased variable costs associated with revenue growth, offset by (iv) the 1Q23 Nonrecurring Cost (v) other operating expenses associated with certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses divested in the fourth quarter of 2023 and (vi) the year-over-year decrease of approximately $21 million in the value of assets held to fund the associated liabilities within our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within employee compensation and benefits, as noted above.\n\n\nGain or Loss on Disposal\n\n\nThe Company recognized net gains on disposals of $31 million in 2024 and $143 million in 2023. The gains on disposal were primarily attributable to the selling of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023 and settlement of certain related contingent payments in 2024. Although we do not routinely sell businesses or customer accounts, we periodically sell an office or a book of business (one or more customer accounts) that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for adequate growth, or because doing so is in the Company’s best interest.\n\n\nAmortization\n\n\nAmortization expense for 2024 increased $12 million to $178 million, or 7.2% over 2023. This change reflects the amortization of new intangibles from businesses acquired within the past twelve months, net of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized or written off in the (Gain)/Loss on disposal.\n\n\nDepreciation\n\n\nDepreciation expense for 2024 increased $4 million to $44 million, or 10.0% over 2023. Changes in depreciation expense reflect net additions of fixed assets resulting from businesses acquired in the past twelve months and the addition of fixed assets resulting from business initiatives, partially offset by the impact of fixed assets that became fully depreciated or written off in the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n\nInterest Expense\n\n\nInterest expense for 2024 increased $3 million to $193 million, or 1.6%, from 2023.\n \n\n\nChange in Estimated Acquisition Earn-Out Payables\n\n\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 - \nBusiness Combinations\n is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100% of the fair value of acquired assets, including goodwill, and assumed liabilities (with only limited exceptions) upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity. Additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase price arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. The recorded purchase price for acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations are required to be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred or reasonably estimated. Estimations of\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npotential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years.\n\n\nThe net charge or credit to the Consolidated Statements of Income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earn-out payables liability, and the accretion of the present value discount on those liabilities.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) as defined in ASC 820 - \nFair Value Measurement\n. The resulting net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in fair value of estimated acquisition earn-out payables\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n14\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense accretion\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet change in earnings from estimated acquisition\n   earn-out payables\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of estimated earn-out payables was reevaluated and decreased by $6 million for 2024 and increased by $14 million for 2023, which are credits and charges, exclusive of interest expense accretion, to the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2024 and 2023.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $167 million, of which $75 million was recorded as accounts payable and $92 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $249 million, of which $146 million was recorded as accounts payable and $103 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nThe effective tax rate on income from operations was 23.1% in 2024 and 24.1% in 2023.\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 15 “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we operate three reportable segments: Retail, Programs and Wholesale Brokerage. On a segmented basis, changes in amortization, depreciation and interest expenses generally result from activity associated with acquisitions. Likewise, other income consists primarily of miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate between comparable periods. As such, management primarily focuses on the Organic Revenue growth rate and EBITDAC Margin when evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe reconciliation of total commissions and fees included in the Consolidated Statements of Income to Organic Revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, including by segment, and the growth rates for Organic Revenue for the year ended December

The $223 million increase in core commissions and fees was driven by the following: (i) approximately $81 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; (ii) an increase of $143 million related to net new and renewal business; (iii) an increase from the impact of Foreign Currency Translation of $8 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $6 million related to commissions and fees recorded in 2023 from businesses since divested. Profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2024 decreased 12.0%, or $6 million, over 2023, to $44 million. This decrease was primarily the result of not qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2024, due to higher loss ratios experienced by our insurance carrier partners. The Retail segment’s total commissions and fees increased 8.7% and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 5.8% for 2024. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by net new business written during the preceding twelve months and growth on renewals of existing customers. Renewal business was impacted by moderating insurance premium rates and exposure units.\n\n\nIncome before income taxes for 2024 increased 12.1%, or $65 million, over the same period in 2023, to $602 million. The primary factors driving this increase were: (i) a decrease in allocated interest expense, (ii) the profit associated with the net increase in revenue as described above and partially offset by, (iii) the increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.\n\n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted for 2024 increased 7.5%, or $57 million, from the same period in 2023, to $818 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for 2024 decreased to 30.0% from 30.3% in the same period in 2023. The decrease in EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted was primarily driven by (i) a decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions, (ii) higher non-cash stock-based compensation and (iii) higher compensation due to investments in employees, which was partially offset by (iv) the net increase in revenue as described above and (v) leveraging our expense base.\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPrograms Segment\n\n\nThe Programs segment manages over 60 programs supported by over 100 well-capitalized carrier partners. In most cases, the insurance carriers that support these programs have delegated underwriting and, in many instances, claims-handling authority to our programs operations. These programs are generally distributed through a global network of independent agents and Brown & Brown retail agents, and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries, trade groups, professions, public entities and market niches. This segment also operates a write-your-own flood insurance carrier, WNFIC and participates in two Captives. WNFIC’s underwriting business consists of policies written on behalf of and fully ceded to the NFIP, as well as excess flood policies, which are fully reinsured in the private market. The Captives provide additional underwriting capacity that enable growth in core commissions and fees, and allow us to participate in underwriting results with limited exposure to claims expenses. The Company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. These Captives give us another way to continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to claims expenses. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain of our MGUs. The Captives limit the Company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by participating in limited tranches of the underwriting risk.\n \n\n\nThe Programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories: Professional Programs, Personal Lines Programs, Commercial Programs, Public Entity-Related Programs and Specialty Programs. Approximately 79% of the Programs segment’s commissions and fees revenue is commission based.\n\n\nFinancial information relating to our Programs segment for the 12 months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions, except percentages)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nREVENUES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore commissions and fees\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,280\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,095\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfit-sharing contingent commissions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n95\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n91.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,400\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,173\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPENSES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n450\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n425\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n290\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n247\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gain)/loss on disposal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(28\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(80.1\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(141\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(16.7\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in estimated acquisition earn-out payables\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nNMF\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n797\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n622\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n603\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n551\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Before Income Taxes Margin \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n43.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n660\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n501\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEBITDAC Margin - Adjusted \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Revenue growth rate \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits relative to total revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses relative to total revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(11.8\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets at December 31\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,158\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,188\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\n“Income Before Income Taxes Margin” is defined as income before income taxes divided by total revenues\n\n\n(2)\nA non-GAAP financial measure\n\n\nNMF = Not a meaningful figure\n\n\nThe Programs segment’s total revenue for 2024 increased 19.4%, or $227 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to $1,400 million. The $185 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i) approximately $224 million of net new renewal business and fee revenues; (ii) an offsetting decrease of $97 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding twelve months and (iii) $57 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023. Profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2024 increased 46.2%, or $30 million, from 2023, to $95 million which was primarily driven by qualifying for certain contingent commissions that we did not qualify for in the prior year, favorable loss ratios, prior year adjustments and acquisitions. Total commissions and fees increase 18.5% and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 22.4% for 2024. The Organic Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong net new business, good retention as well as exposure unit expansion across several of our programs and claims revenue associated with hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome before income taxes for 2024 increased 9.4%, or $52 million, from 2023, to $603 million. Income before income taxes increased due to the drivers of EBITDAC - Adjusted described below partially offset by changes in the gains on disposal which were primarily attributable to the selling of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted for 2024 increased 31.7%, or $159 million, from the same period in 2023, to $660 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for 2024 increased to 47.1% from 42.7%. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted increased due to strong Organic Revenue growth and leveraging our expense base, increase in profit sharing contingent commissions and the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\n \n\n\nWholesale Brokerage Segment\n\n\nThe Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, including Brown & Brown retail agents.

The $59 million increase in core commissions and fees was driven by the following: (i) $48 million related to net new and renewal business; (ii) $10 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions and dispositions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; and (iii) an increase from the impact of Foreign Currency Translation of $1 million. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2024 increased $12 million compared to 2023, to $27 million, primarily driven by improved underwriting results, increased written premium, finalization of prior-year estimates and acquisitions completed in the past twelve months. The Wholesale Brokerage segment’s growth rate for total commissions and fees was 13.2%, and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 9.1% for 2024. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by strong new business and good retention, as well as a combination of exposure unit and rate increases.\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome before income taxes for 2024 increased 38.9%, or $49 million, over 2023, to $175 million, due to the following: (i) the growth of EBITDAC - Adjusted described below and (ii) a decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.\n\n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted for 2024 increased 16.8%, or $29 million, from the same period in 2023, to $202 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for 2024 increased to 32.8% from 32.0% for the same period in 2023 due to: (i) total revenues growth; (ii) certain nonrecurring operating expenses in the prior year; and (iii) leveraging our expense base.\n\n\nOther\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Segment Information tables “Other” includes any income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments, and corporate-related items, including the intercompany interest expense charges to reporting segments.\n\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\nThe Company seeks to maintain a conservative balance sheet and strong liquidity profile. Our capital requirements to operate as an insurance intermediary are low, and we have been able to grow and invest in our business through a combination of cash that has been generated from operations, the disciplined use of debt and the issuance of equity as part of the purchase price consideration to acquire certain businesses. We have the ability to utilize our Revolving Credit Facility, which as of December 31, 2024 provided capacity for up to $550 million in additional available cash. We believe that we have access to additional funds, if needed, through the capital markets or private placements to obtain further debt financing under the current market conditions. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment portfolio and funds generated from operations, together with the funds available under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement\"), will be sufficient to satisfy its normal liquidity needs, including principal payments on our long-term debt, for the next 12 months and in the long term.\n\n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains an expansion option for up to an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to the approval of participating lenders. Additionally, the Company may, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of additional term loan commitments by new or existing lenders, increase either Term Loan Commitment under the existing Loan Agreement or the term loans issued thereunder or issue new tranches of term loans in an aggregate additional amount of up to $400 million. Including the expansion options under all existing credit agreements, the Company has access to up to $1,450 million of incremental borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $675 million at December 31, 2024 reflecting a decrease of $25 million from the $700 million balance at December 31, 2023.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $172 million of cash and cash equivalents outside of the U.S. From time to time, the Company will evaluate the repatriation of available funds from our non-U.S. operating subsidiaries or permanently reinvest a portion of those funds in those various territories.\n \n\n\nOperating Cash Flows\n\n\nOur operating cash flows are primarily derived from the net income generated during the period adjusted for non-cash expenses, which include depreciation, amortization, changes in estimated earnout payables, non-cash stock based compensation and deferred income taxes while excluding gains and losses on sales/disposals of investments, businesses, fixed assets and customer accounts, payments on acquisition earn-outs in excess of original estimated payables and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities and receipts of receivables from commissions and fees related to our revenues. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities (the “current ratio”) was 1.10 and 1.04 for December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n\nCash flows generated from operating activities totaled $1,174 million and $1,010 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of $164 million, 16.2%. Operating cash flows generated in 2024 included $1,002 million from net income before non-controlling interests with $277 million of non-cash adjustments, offset by $105 million from changes in working capital. The growth in cash from operations is primarily due to increased operating margins from strong organic revenue growth, offset by an increase in our taxes paid, net of refunds, of $84 million mainly due to the 2023 deferral of $121 million related to certain federal income tax payments due to Hurricane Idalia tax relief, which was announced by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") on August 30, 2023.
