  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview \nFedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network.\nOur website is located at fedex.com. Detailed information about our services, e-commerce tools and solutions, and corporate responsibility initiatives can be found on our website. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all exhibits and amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable on the day they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The Investor Relations page of our website, investors.fedex.com, contains a significant amount of information about FedEx, including our SEC filings and financial and other information for investors. The information that we post on the Investor Relations page of our website could be deemed to be material information. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in FedEx to visit this website from time to time, as information is updated and new information is posted. The information on our website, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report. \nIn connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan, on June 1, 2024, FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”) and FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. were merged into Federal Express Corporation (“Federal Express”), becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight, Inc. (“FedEx Freight”) provides less-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, Federal Express and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and constitute our reportable segments. Additionally, the results of FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (“FedEx Custom Critical”) are included in the FedEx Freight segment instead of the Federal Express segment in 2025. For more information, please see “Business Segments” below. For financial information concerning our reportable segments, refer to “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” and “\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n” of this Annual Report.\nAdditionally, the FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”) operating segment is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. The FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) operating segment provides document and business services and retail access to our package transportation businesses and the FedEx Logistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) operating segment provides customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding, as well as integrated supply chain management solutions through FedEx Supply Chain Distribution System, Inc. (“FedEx Supply Chain”). FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Office, and FedEx Logistics are included in “Corporate, other, and eliminations” in our segment reporting. For more information about FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Office, and FedEx Logistics, please see “FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment,” “FedEx Office Operating Segment,” and “FedEx Logistics Operating Segment” under “Business Segments” below.\nIn December 2024, we announced that FedEx’s Board of Directors decided to pursue a full separation of FedEx Freight through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company. The transaction, which would be implemented through the spin-off of shares of the new company to FedEx stockholders, is expected to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes for FedEx stockholders and be completed by June 2026.\nExcept as otherwise specified, any reference to a year in this Annual Report indicates our fiscal year  May 31, 2025 or ended May 31 of the year referenced, and comparisons are to the corresponding period of the prior year. In January 2025, the Board of Directors approved a change in FedEx's fiscal year end from May 31 to December 31. The fiscal year change will be effective for the period beginning June 1, 2026.\nStrategy \nThe collective FedEx brand gives us our competitive edge. Further, our strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio, in the long-term best interest of the enterprise. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall long-term return on invested capital for our business as a whole. We focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. Our business strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which the customer operates, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and innovation have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy.\n-2-\nFor more than 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. With the significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are continuing to evolve to improve our operational efficiency and enhance profitability through one FedEx, Network 2.0 (our multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada), DRIVE (our comprehensive program to improve long-term profitability), and Tricolor (the redesign of the Federal Express international air network as part of the DRIVE program to improve efficiency and asset utilization). We are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence. \nThe DRIVE program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We have commenced our plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0. As of May 31, 2025, we had implemented Network 2.0 optimization in approximately 290 locations in the U.S. and Canada. Using a market-by-market approach, service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of Federal Express packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others. See “Business Segments” below, “",
  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, DRIVE, and Tricolor. \nInnovation inspired our start at FedEx over 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational efficiency. See “Business Segments” below for more information. The size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offerings. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and the end-to-end experience of our customers by making supply chains smarter for everyone. \nIn September 2024, we launched fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey. See “Federal Express Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce and Digital Solutions” below for more information. In early 2025, we formed a new enterprise-wide Data & Technology team, which is focused on initiatives to streamline the technology used during the package delivery lifecycle; establish global standards across pickup-and-delivery, linehaul, sort, and clearance operations; and improve digital products and experiences for the FedEx enterprise and our customers\n.\n“Safety Above All” is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.\nThrough our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world’s largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product. We continue to position our company and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.\nBusiness Segments \nThe following describes in more detail the operations of each of our principal operating segments:\nFederal Express Segment  \nOverview \nFederal Express pioneered the express transportation industry over 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader today, providing a range of rapid, reliable, time- and day-definite delivery services to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated air-ground express network.\nAs of May 31, 2025, Federal Express employed approximately 440,000 employees and had approximately 63,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as over 15,000 Walgreens and Dollar General stores), nearly 700 aircraft, and over 175,000 motorized vehicles in its global network. Federal Express contracts with approximately 5,700 independent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations. See “Operations” below for information regarding the consolidation of these operations into the surface operations of Federal Express. Federal Express also provides cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions.\n-3-\nU.S. and Canadian Services \nFederal Express offers a wide range of U.S. and Canadian domestic shipping services for packages and freight. Federal Express offers three U.S. domestic overnight package delivery services (FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, and FedEx Standard Overnight) and three U.S. domestic deferred package delivery services (FedEx 2Day, FedEx 2Day AM, and FedEx Express Saver). FedEx SameDay service is available 365 days a year throughout all 50 states for urgent shipments up to 150 pounds. Federal Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services to handle the needs of the time-definite freight market. \nFederal Express is also a leading provider of day-definite business and residential delivery services for packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Federal Express service reaches 100% of the continental U.S. population and nearly 100% of the Canadian population. Federal Express offers day-definite residential delivery service to 99% of the U.S. population on Saturdays and to nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population on Sundays. Federal Express offers day-definite delivery service on Saturdays to over 40% of the Canadian population with FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, and FedEx 2Day services. Federal Express also offers an economy service that is available for the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address in the U.S. \nInternational Services\nFederal Express offers a wide range of international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight, connecting markets that generate more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product. FedEx international package services include a money-back guarantee. Federal Express’s unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the world’s largest express transportation company. \nInternational express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from more than 90 countries, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and delivery by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. Our FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 25 countries and territories. Federal Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and in Southern Africa. In addition, Federal Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance. FedEx International Connect Plus, an e-commerce service currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 190 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days.\nOperations\nFederal Express’s largest sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company’s multiple hub-and-spoke system and worldwide air network. A second national air hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to expand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize our Memphis hub. In addition to these national air hubs, Federal Express operates regional air hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities at airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. \nFacilities at airports in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional air hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami serves our South Florida, Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition to its worldwide air network, Federal Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and South America. Federal Express’s unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 27 transit hubs and more than 550 stations. \nWith the significant growth of e-commerce, and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are fundamentally redesigning our international air network to operate more efficiently. The redesigned network continues to deploy FedEx-owned aircraft in the delivery of International Priority parcel shipments using our existing hub-and-spoke model. Additionally, a portion of our owned aircraft fleet has been retimed to operate off-cycle, allowing us to build density, decongest hubs, and connect our global surface networks. Finally, we are leveraging our global partner network as an adaptive capacity layer, particularly on imbalanced trade lanes, to move e-commerce and deferred volumes.\nThroughout its worldwide network, Federal Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area. In some international areas, independent agents \n-4-\n(“Global Service Participants”) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see “\nItem 2. Properties\n” of this Annual Report under the caption “Federal Express Segment.” \nFederal Express also operates a highly flexible surface network of approximately 720 legacy FedEx Ground and 530 legacy FedEx Express facilities, as of May 31, 2025, that support its U.S. and Canada surface operations. Through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which we pick up, transport, and deliver packages in the U.S. and Canada, these operations are being consolidated. We have completed implementation of Network 2.0 in Canada and implemented Network 2.0 at approximately 130 locations in the U.S. Under Network 2.0, Federal Express continues to utilize both its employee couriers and service providers in U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. See “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” and “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information on Network 2.0.\nFederal Express continues to maximize the use of existing U.S. surface facilities through Network 2.0. Many of these facilities utilize advanced automated unloading and sorting technology to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. This technology includes a yard management system in many facilities which interacts with GPS tags on trailers to automatically notify the control center when a trailer arrives and departs. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination stations for local delivery. \nThrough collaboration with FedEx Dataworks, Federal Express is also implementing dynamic scheduling tools at many U.S. surface facilities to match sort staffing with volumes and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity. In addition, dock modernization efforts enabled by FedEx Dataworks, including a network operating plan that uses machine learning and algorithms to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts, are enhancing productivity at these facilities in furtherance of our DRIVE initiatives. Federal Express is also testing autonomous, driverless technologies in the handling of large, non-conveyable packages, as well as robotic product sortation systems to sort small packages.\nFederal Express offers service providers advanced route optimization technology supported by the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks that includes near real-time data that service providers may use to plan efficient delivery routes and vehicle mix. To promote safe operations, service providers contracting with Federal Express agree to use certain safety-related vehicle technologies and satisfy certain driver standards. Additionally, software systems and internet-based applications are deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. Federal Express provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx e-commerce tools and solutions, including FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see “Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce Solutions” below.\nPricing \nFederal Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 6, 2025, a 5.9% average list price increase was implemented in the U.S. for domestic and international services. List prices also increased for contractual services and in international markets at this time.\nFederal Express implements and adjusts demand surcharges from time to time based on assessments of shipment volume and capacity in our network. For U.S. domestic services, demand surcharges historically have applied to shipments that exceed certain length, girth, and weight thresholds or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Demand surcharges on U.S. domestic services initially implemented in 2020 remained in effect for the first half of 2024. Higher surcharges were applied during the 2024 holiday shipping season, after which time the U.S. domestic demand surcharges were suspended. Demand surcharges on international services initially implemented in 2020 were reduced for select lanes in September 2023, October 2023, and January 2024 and remained in effect for the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, and African region until June 3, 2024, and for all other international markets until April 29, 2024. The surcharges were reinstated for select international lanes in August 2024, with subsequent rate changes during the remainder of 2025. The surcharges were ended on May 31, 2025, except for shipments inbound to Israel and Canada, which continue until further notice. A demand surcharge on U.S. to Canada international ground services was implemented beginning in June 2025.\nFederal Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from roughly two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective September 2, 2024, February 10, 2025, and June 9, 2025, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges for U.S. domestic services were updated. The tables used to determine fuel surcharges for international services were updated in July 2024, October 2024, and June 2025. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information. \n-5-\nRetail Access Network\nFedEx Office offers retail access to Federal Express shipping services at all of its retail locations. Federal Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites, including at more than 15,000 Walgreens and Dollar General stores. Our unstaffed FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, and corporate or industrial parks. Federal Express has a total of approximately 63,000 drop-off locations.\nFuel Supplies and Costs \nDuring 2025, Federal Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. We do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See “Pricing” above. \nThe following table sets forth Federal Express’s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of FedEx Corporation consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:  \nFiscal Year\nTotal Jet\nFuel Costs\n(in millions)\nPercentage of\nConsolidated\nRevenue\n2025\n$\n2,832 \n3.2 \n%\n2024\n3,598 \n4.1 \n2023\n4,515 \n5.0 \n2022\n3,867 \n4.1 \n2021\n2,065 \n2.5 \nMost of Federal Express’s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts. \nCompetition\nAs described in “I\ntem 1A. Risk Factors\n” of this Annual Report, the U.S. domestic and international package and the U.S. domestic freight and international freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer’s overall supply chain. \nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. Federal Express’s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France’s La Poste’s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. Federal Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors and delivery service providers for deliveries, and may be considered competitors in addition to customers. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles, recently began offering an LTL freight service for inbound shipments to its distribution facilities, and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of Federal Express’s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than Federal Express. For more information, see “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” of this Annual Report.\nEmployees and Service Providers\nRajesh Subramaniam is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Express, John A. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer – United States and Canada, and Richard W. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer – International and Chief Executive Officer – Airline. As of May 31, 2025, Federal Express employed approximately 237,000 permanent full-time and approximately 203,000 permanent part-time employees. In addition, Federal Express contracts with approximately 5,700 independent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.\nThe pilots at Federal Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) began actively mediating the negotiations. In July 2023, Federal Express’s pilots failed to ratify the tentative successor agreement that was approved by ALPA’s FedEx Master Executive Council the prior month. Bargaining for a successor agreement continues. In April 2024, the NMB rejected ALPA’s request for a proffer of arbitration. \n-6-\nFederal Express will continue to bargain in good faith and the ongoing bargaining process has no effect on our operations. In addition to our pilots, certain of Federal Express’s non-U.S. employees are unionized. FedEx believes its employee relations are excellent. See “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” of this Annual Report for more information. \nCustomer-Driven Technology \nFedEx is a world leader in technology, and late FedEx founder and long-time Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick W. Smith’s vision that “the information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself” remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers’ business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed, and reliability. Additionally, FedEx stands at the nexus of digital and physical networks, a crucial intersection for the success of e-commerce and time-sensitive deliveries. We continue to expand our e-commerce convenience network and explore innovative alternatives to help customers and businesses deliver. During 2025, we continued to advance a major information technology transition from traditional mainframe computing to cloud-based systems, which is delivering significant benefits in terms of flexibility, security, speed to market, and resiliency. See “FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment” below for more information on the solutions we are creating to enhance the end-to-end experience of our customers by making supply chains smarter for everyone.\nShipping Management and Precision Tracking\nThe fedex.com website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use, and customer-focused features. The advanced tracking capability within FedEx Tracking provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments. Additionally, an advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by FedEx Dataworks has enhanced tracking capabilities on fedex.com, delivering greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments. FedEx Virtual Assistant on fedex.com is an artificial-intelligence-enabled service that provides answers to customer shipping questions, allowing our customer service representatives and sales professionals to focus on higher-value customer interactions. \nSenseAware Mobile, a FedEx innovation currently available in over 130 countries worldwide, allows customers to stay connected to their critical shipments by providing real-time updates regarding current location, temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure readings, light exposure, shock events, tilt beyond a certain angle, and healthcare subsampling. Additionally, FedEx SenseAware ID is a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that delivers a new level of precision tracking. The enhanced location visibility provided by FedEx SenseAware ID is creating opportunities for FedEx customers to reimagine their supply chains through real-time updates on a package’s location within the Federal Express network.\nFedEx Mobile is a suite of solutions including the FedEx mobile application, FedEx mobile website, and SMS text messaging. The FedEx Mobile app provides convenience for recipients to track packages and access FedEx Delivery Manager to customize home deliveries. Shippers can easily get rates and estimated delivery times and swiftly create a shipping label. All users can quickly find the nearest FedEx location for Hold at Location or drop-off. It is available on Android™ and Apple devices. The FedEx Mobile app has expanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 40 languages. \nFedEx Surround is a visibility platform that allows customers to view and manage shipments in one place. The tool provides global visibility into shipments with package-level insights in near real-time. Advanced features include predictive delay notifications, weather advisories, and customizable views and reports and intervention capability. \nIn 2023, FedEx announced the launch of Picture Proof of Delivery for express and ground residential deliveries in the U.S. and Canada that are released without a signature. The capability has since expanded to 60 countries globally. \nAdditionally, our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes. \nE-Commerce and Digital Solutions\nFedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations, and times of delivery. Additionally, FedEx Returns Technology, a comprehensive solution for returns management, provides high-volume merchants and e-tailers complete visibility into returns and an easy way to track shipments, manage inventory, analyze returns trends, and make more informed decisions based on shoppers’ returns behaviors. In 2025, FedEx announced the launch of FedEx Easy Returns, a cost-effective way to combine customer returns into one shipment. \nThe FedEx retail convenience network also utilizes third-party retailers to receive and hold packages for FedEx customers. The U.S. retail convenience network has grown to include over 15,000 Walgreens and Dollar General stores in addition to our approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations and over 600 FedEx Ship Centers. In addition to allowing for an easy returns and drop-off experience for shoppers, the retail convenience network is well positioned to serve as a “buy online, pickup in store” network for small and medium merchants without brick-and-mortar locations. We have also added FedEx Returns Technology at Walgreens locations, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels and eliminates the need to include a return label in every package. \n-7-\nWe have expanded e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, a service that enables participating retailers to fulfill e-commerce orders into the evening and receive late pickups by Federal Express, with next-day local delivery and two-day shipping to any address in the continental U.S. FedEx Extra Hours, which is currently available to select customers, allows retailers to extend evening order cutoff times by five to eight hours, with some as late as midnight, depending on their current order fulfillment process.\nIn September 2024, FedEx launched fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey. Enabled by FedEx Dataworks and by providing data and insights that improve visibility and connected capabilities across the customer journey, fdx will help merchants make more strategic logistics decisions from point of demand to delivery and returns. In May 2025, we launched a platform-based trade clearance solution to help our customers and other stakeholders navigate increasing operational complexities amid changing global trade policy. \nMy FedEx Rewards allows businesses in the U.S. to earn rewards for their loyalty in shipping and printing with FedEx. \nSee “The Environment” below for information about our FedEx\n®\n Sustainability Insights tool, which gives customers and suppliers access to estimated CO2e emission data associated with FedEx shipments.\nAutonomous Solutions\nFedEx is exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within its operations. In 2022, we began a pilot program with Aurora Innovation, Inc. (“Aurora”) and PACCAR Inc. (“PACCAR”) to test Aurora’s autonomous driving technology in PACCAR autonomous vehicle platform-equipped trucks within FedEx linehaul operations.\nMarketing\nThe FedEx brand name symbolizes outstanding service, reliability, and speed. Emphasis is continually placed on promoting and protecting the FedEx brand, one of our most important assets. As a result, FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world. In addition to television, print, and digital advertising, we promote the FedEx brand through sponsorships and special events. For example, FedEx sponsors:\n•\nThe Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League, which is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.\n•\nThe season-long FedExCup competition on the PGA Tour, and the FedEx St. Jude Championship, a PGA Tour event that has raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and is one of three annual FedExCup playoff events.\n•\nFedExForum in Memphis, the arena in which the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies and the University of Memphis men’s basketball team play their respective home games.\nAdditionally, FedEx is the “Official Delivery Service Sponsor” and “Official Office Services Provider” of the NFL, through which we conduct events and other activities to promote the FedEx brand, such as the “FedEx Air & Ground” NFL Players of the Week and Players of the Year Awards.\nInformation Security\nFedEx has a team of highly qualified professionals dedicated to securing information about our customers’ shipments and protecting our customers’, vendors’, and employees’ privacy, and we strive to provide a safe, secure online environment for our customers. We are committed to compliance with applicable information security laws, regulations, and industry standards. For more information, see “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” and “\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\n” of this Annual Report.\nFedEx Freight Segment\nFedEx Freight\nOverview\nFedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers — FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses.

John A. Smith is the President of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight’s primary competitors are XPO, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight (an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc., and TFI International Inc. \nIn December 2024, we announced that FedEx’s Board of Directors decided to pursue a full separation of FedEx Freight through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company. The transaction, which would be implemented through the spin-off of shares of the new company to FedEx stockholders, is expected to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes for FedEx stockholders and be completed by June 2026. See “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n — Strategic Risks — The planned spin-off of FedEx Freight may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and there is no guarantee that the spin-off, if completed, will achieve the intended financial and strategic benefits.” for more information. \nPricing\n \nFedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 6, 2025, FedEx Freight implemented a 5.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF EZONE rates and a 6.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF 1000 and FXF 501. These increases apply for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada. \nFedEx Freight implements and adjusts demand surcharges from time-to-time based on assessments of shipment volume and capacity in our network. Beginning in July 2021, FedEx Freight implemented a demand surcharge applying to specific delivery points within the U.S. The demand surcharge has been adjusted periodically since implementation. Effective November 15, 2021, FedEx Freight increased applicable length surcharges. Effective January 17, 2022, FedEx Freight added a surcharge that applies when a pickup is performed and no shipment is tendered to the carrier. Effective January 16, 2023, FedEx Freight changed the extreme length surcharge to a tier-based length structure. The company continues to explore ways to modernize freight pricing including through dimension-in-motion technology, which more accurately captures freight profile and improves its ability to cost and price shipments.\nFedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two days prior to the day in which it is assessed. Effective August 26, 2024, and June 9, 2025, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Freight were updated. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” for more information. \n-9-\nFedEx Custom Critical \nFedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report.\nTrademarks\nFederal Express owns numerous trademarks and intellectual property rights relating to the “FedEx” trademark. Those trademarks, service marks, and trade names are essential to our worldwide business, and include FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Logistics, FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Custom Critical, and ShopRunner. Federal Express licenses the use of certain trademarks to support our business, and takes active measures to enforce its intellectual property rights where appropriate.\nRegulation  \nAir\n. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the “Federal Aviation Act”), both the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over Federal Express’s air operations. \nThe FAA’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of Federal Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. Federal Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as Federal Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations. \nThe DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. Federal Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT authorizing the company to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. These certificates remain in effect as we maintain our economic fitness to perform all-cargo services following the one FedEx consolidation.\nUnder the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires Federal Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us. \nFederal Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of Federal Express’s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. Federal Express would be compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, Federal Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. Federal Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights. \nSee “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations, that could affect our business.\nGround\n. The ground transportation performed by employees and service providers of Federal Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes, or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. Federal Express is registered in those states that require registration. \nThe interstate operations of Federal Express that utilize service providers to conduct certain linehaul operations, as well as the interstate operations of FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical, are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates, routes, and services in interstate freight transportation. \nLike other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.\nInternational\n. Federal Express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take \n-12-\naction against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of Federal Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as Federal Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments. \nOur operations outside of the U.S., such as Federal Express’s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as Federal Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. \nEnvironmental. \nNoise:\n Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Federal Express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current FAA noise standards. Although the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy that enables certain airport operators to implement noise abatement programs, it created an opportunity for Federal Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. Additionally, certain U.S. airport operators have implemented local noise regulations, and certain foreign jurisdictions impose noise-based limitations on airline operations. Neither the National Noise Policy nor any domestic or foreign local noise regulations have a material effect in any of Federal Express’s significant markets. \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions:\n \nViews about climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”) in lieu of a patchwork of country-level requirements to address emissions from international flights. This program established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation beginning in calendar 2021. Any growth above a global industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or qualifying sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) purchases. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on international aviation, during the pilot phase of the CORSIA program (from calendar 2021 to calendar 2023), flight activity did not exceed the baseline, so airlines had no offsetting obligations. During the subsequent first phase of the program, which runs from calendar 2024 to calendar 2026, flight activity is rebounding, and emissions are expected to exceed the baseline. The U.S. agreed to participate but has not fully implemented CORSIA to date. In the interim, we continue to voluntarily report our emissions data to the FAA. \nOther ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG emissions. For example, both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”). For the EU, under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines including Federal Express were required to purchase emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying SAF if they exceeded the number of free allowances allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through calendar 2026, the EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European Commission should propose to expand the scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA implementation and performance. \nWe expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including CORSIA and ETS program elements still under development or reconsideration, the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize SAF in the future and the price of such fuels, the availability of free allowances (which will be eliminated entirely by the end of calendar 2026), and the price of eligible emission units, offsets, or allowances required to be purchased by FedEx. \nAdditionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production cutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA finalized its own conforming rulemaking to implement the standards through its aircraft certification process which went into effect on in April 2024. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In January 2025, the U.S. again withdrew from the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce \n-13-\nGHG emissions. The effect of the withdrawal on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain.\nAdditionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business. Starting in January 2025, we are required to monitor and report the non-carbon dioxide aviation effects for certain routes in the European Union as part of the expanded scope of the ETS. In January 2027, we will be required to monitor and report non-carbon dioxide effects for all flight activity involving an airport located in the EEA. While the requirement currently is only to report and verify the non-carbon dioxide emissions, we may be required to comply with additional reporting obligations in the future. See “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n — Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks — We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change” for information on disclosure requirements regarding GHG emissions and other environmental matters.\nSustainable Aviation Fuels:\n On October 18, 2023, the EU adopted its RefuelEU regulation requiring fuel producers at certain EU airports to supply a minimum percentage of blended SAF to aircraft operators beginning January 1, 2025. The mandate requires that, beginning in calendar 2025, two percent of the jet fuel supplied in certain EU airports must qualify as SAF, and the percentage increases incrementally to 70% in calendar 2050. Fuel suppliers have incorporated a SAF fee into future uptake agreements for their compliance or production costs related to the Refuel EU regulation. As part of the RefuelEU requirements, beginning January 1, 2025, we are required to submit a verified compliance report on actual fuel uplift at EU covered airports, SAF purchases, and economic fuel tankering. A similar mandate went into effect in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2025. We continue to monitor the introduction of fuel mandates in other countries and regions across the world.\nHazardous Substances:\n U.S. federal and state authorities continue to adopt legislation and regulations restricting the use of certain\n \nper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”). PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams approved for use by the FAA to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries.\n \nIn April 2025, the EPA announced its strategic plans to comprehensively address PFAS in air emissions, water, land, waste, and manufactured and imported products. Certain states have adopted laws banning the manufacture, sale, distribution, and/or use of firefighting foams with intentionally added PFAS. The EPA rule designating certain PFAS as “hazardous substances” under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) became effective July 2024. The EPA rule could subject airlines and refineries to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination. We could incur remediation costs for currently and formerly operated facilities. While the impact of these federal and state laws and regulations on our business and operations cannot currently be predicted, we remain committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression in accordance with the framework outlined by the FAA in May 2023.\nVehicle Emissions Regulations:\n The Clean Air Act grants the EPA and, through the preemption waiver process, the state of California the authority to set vehicle emission standards. In October 2023, the California Air Resources Board’s (“CARB”) Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) rule requiring subject companies to add an increasing percentage of medium and heavy duty zero emission trucks became effective. The U.S. president signed congressional resolutions preventing California from implementing its ACF rule and its stricter emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles in June 2025. In response, California filed a lawsuit challenging the president’s authority to prevent implementation of the program and standards. We will continue to monitor federal and state actions on vehicle emissions regulations for impacts to our operations.\nWe are also subject to other U.S. and international environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods, the management of underground storage tanks, the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment, and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, certain contractual and lease agreements governing regulated substances could trigger investigation and remediation obligations if sites become affected. Federal Express has an environmental management system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational environmental footprint and certified all U.S. airport locations in 2022. \nExport Controls.\n In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the “ECRA”) and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (the “IEEPA”), and their implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and Office of Foreign Asset Control regulations, may hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for violations without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA and IEEPA can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties up to $378,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx continues to invest in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases FedEx’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs.\nCustoms Clearance, Customs Brokerage, and Freight Forwarding\n. Our customs clearance activities, including customs brokerage, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other partner government agencies (for example, the Food and \n-14-\nDrug Administration) that regulate the importation and exportation of specific products. Our freight forwarding activities are regulated by the Transportation Security Administration within the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and the Department of Transportation (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions. \nLabor\n. All U.S. employees at Federal Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the “RLA”), while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the “NLRA”). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the nation’s economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process. \nThe RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are now the dominant national transportation systems. As an express air carrier with an integrated air/ground network, Federal Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company. The purpose of the RLA is to provide employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting the nation’s transportation networks from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at Federal Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network. \nThe U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most Federal Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the Federal Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground express network. This jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation and Network 2.0. In addition, the NMB and the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, and employees of service providers contracting with Federal Express to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these and other potential labor law changes, see “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” of this Annual Report.\nData Protection.\n There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally. For more information, see “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” of this Annual Report.\nReputation and Responsibility\nFedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2025, FedEx ranked 20\nth\n overall on FORTUNE magazine’s “World’s Most Admired Companies” list — the 25\nth\n consecutive year FedEx has ranked among the top 20 on the prestigious list. We also retained our position as the highest ranked delivery company on the overall “World’s Most Admired Companies” list. Additionally in 2025, Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, named FedEx as one of the “World’s Most Ethical Companies\n®\n” for the third consecutive year. Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For example, in 2025, FedEx was named a finalist for the “Top Companies for Women to Work in Transportation” by Redefining the Road, the official magazine of the Women in Trucking Association, and was also recognized as one of Forbes’ “America’s Best Employers 2025.” \nThe success of our efforts is built on our sound corporate responsibility practices, which are aligned with our strategic focus. Our 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report is available at \nfedex.com/en-us/sustainability/reports.html.\n This report details progress toward our sustainability strategies, goals, and initiatives and our approach toward industry leadership in sustainability to support our strategy and values. Information in our Corporate Responsibility Report is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report.\nWe remain committed to helping lift local economies by investing in people and communities where we live and work. In the U.S., this includes seeking diverse suppliers and strengthening our supply chain by sourcing from small, minority-, and women-owned businesses. We have a history of supporting diverse and inclusive nonprofit and community empowerment organizations to create greater economic opportunity, help amplify diverse voices, and provide access to leadership, educational, and employment opportunities that inspire people to succeed.\n-15-\nHuman Resource Management\nOur Culture\nAt FedEx, our unified culture has enabled us to drive progress and innovation for over 50 years. At the foundation of our culture is our People-Service-Profit philosophy—the belief that creating an environment where people are valued and have an opportunity to succeed leads to exceptional service, which generates the profitability to fund our future and reward our people. Our team members span geographies and backgrounds yet we are united by a common goal—the Purple Promise, which is our commitment to make every FedEx experience outstanding. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with management our key human resource management strategies and programs.\nOur culture is a strategic asset and a key enabler. Our five culture values—take care of each other, commit to do good, own outstanding, drive business results, and create what’s next—are attributes that inspire confidence and commitment from team members, global communities, customers, and stockholders. We are a global team of innovators and collaborators, committed to bringing our People-Service-Profit philosophy to life by: \n•\nPrioritizing safety.\n•\nTaking care of our team members.\n•\nEmbracing inclusion so everyone feels appreciated, valued, and provided opportunities to grow within the company.\n•\nDelivering excellence and value for our customers and stockholders.\n•\nActing with integrity in all that we do.\n•\nSupporting our communities.\n•\nHelping shape a better world.\n•\nGrowing profitably to reinvest in our team members and business.\nFollowing the one FedEx consolidation, we are continuing to harmonize our human resource structures across the enterprise to improve team collaboration and enable more effective sharing of knowledge, resources, and strategies.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health, safety, and well-being of our team members and service providers are top priorities. We foster safety within our operations, on the road, and in surrounding communities to help reduce the frequency and severity of accidents and injuries. Our business decisions are informed by our “Safety Above All” philosophy, which is integrated in our health and safety policies, technology investments, risk evaluation processes, training programs, and awards. The Governance, Safety, and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our safety strategies, policies, programs, and practices and safety-related risk management strategies, programs, and initiatives. \nEquality, Opportunity, and Diversity\nFedEx is—and has been since its founding in 1971—committed to equality, opportunity, and diversity and the belief that when we give everyone the opportunity to grow and advance in their careers, our team members thrive and FedEx prospers. Equality, opportunity, and diversity are interwoven across our four strategic pillars: Our People; Our Education and Engagement; Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our Story. Each international region at FedEx has councils that leverage the unique perspectives of our team members and embed culture, equality, opportunity, and diversity across business operations. We also offer a variety of Employee Resource Groups, which are open to all FedEx employees and provide a unique blend of social, educational, and professional opportunities that support personal and professional growth and business objectives. Consolidated EEO-1 Reports can be found at \nfedex.com/en-us/sustainability/reports.html\n.\nQuality of Life\nWe promote the health, safety, and well-being of our people through integrated benefit offerings that apply to everyday life, both inside and outside of work. Our comprehensive benefits include healthcare coverage, well-being programs, basic and supplemental life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, paid sick leave, paid time off, and parental leave for all eligible full- and part-time employees. Our teams also analyze survey data at the local, national, and enterprise levels and conduct routine peer benchmarking and internal pay equity analyses to incorporate best practices, keep abreast of regulatory developments, and develop competitive offerings.\n-16-\nIn the U.S., we cover approximately 70% of the total eligible health costs at the plan level for approximately 350,000 enrolled employees and dependents. These health benefits include flexible medical, behavioral, dental, vision, and pharmacy coverage, in addition to mental health services. We are dedicated to supporting the mental health of our employees. Our Employee Assistance Program offers free, confidential counseling and mental health services 24/7 to both U.S. employees and their household members, regardless of their enrollment in our medical plan, and we are in the process of expanding this program globally. We frequently communicate with employees on how to access these resources to promote their use across the enterprise.\nLearning and Development\nWe are committed to helping our team members grow and develop their careers at FedEx and constantly adapt our offerings to meet current company needs and prepare capabilities we anticipate needing in the future. As part of the core new employee orientation, all new hires are required to learn about safety, security, compliance, and sustainability as applied to the responsibilities of their respective roles. Additionally, the FedEx Learning Center houses easily accessible online courses available to all team members and allows us to track progress on employee learning goals. We also implement programs and initiatives for our executives that focus on leadership skills, succession planning, and fostering institutional knowledge to facilitate engagement, career growth, and strong leadership.\nThrough our Learning inspired by FedEx (LiFE) program, in collaboration with the University of Memphis, we offer free, online degree opportunities across 30 associates’ and bachelors’ programs. Our Education for Life program also offers discounted or debt-free college at several schools in the U.S. to promote higher education and personal development. FedEx maintains a robust performance management process to support ongoing dialogue and career growth for our team members. \nTalent Acquisition, Engagement, and Turnover\nFedEx uses effective recruiting processes to attract top-tier candidates. Our hiring strategy is data-driven and centered around recruiting a unified, skilled workforce that meets our unique business needs. In addition to the development of our external talent pipeline, we are committed to providing opportunities to upskill current team members to ensure our workforce successfully meets our evolving business needs. Job-specific learning opportunities include our Driver Development program, which provides hands-on experience for team members to become professional tractor-trailer drivers. We conduct periodic audits of our labor practices to assess compliance with regulatory requirements.\nWe strive to retain our talented team members through engagement opportunities, competitive wages, comprehensive benefits, flexible scheduling, and a wide range of career development programs. We value our team members’ feedback and utilize annual surveys, employee networks, and direct channels to gather constructive feedback and recommendations. These initiatives enable us to listen to our team members’ challenges and recommendations to help us refine our human resource management strategy and optimize the employee experience. We also include culture- and inclusion-related questions within our engagement surveys to better understand all perspectives in our workforce and integrate employee feedback into our initiatives.\nGlobally, in 2025, we hired over 406,000 full- and part-time team members. Turnover for part-time team members, primarily package handlers at our sorting locations, was 70%, while full-time team member turnover was 24%, in 2025. Turnover rates among part-time frontline workers in a number of industries are historically higher than among other employee groups. Within the ground transportation industry, many part-time workers pursue temporary employment opportunities that allow them to exit and re-enter the workforce more frequently based on their needs. These traditionally higher rates have recently been further exacerbated by elevated hiring volumes.\nOther Information\nAs of May 31, 2025, FedEx employed approximately 300,000 permanent full-time and approximately 210,000 permanent part-time employees and utilized approximately 5,700 service providers to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.\nSee “Business Segments — Federal Express Segment — Employees and Service Providers” for information regarding our continued bargaining efforts to reach an agreement with the union representing our pilots. A small number of our other employees are members of unions. For additional information, see “Business Segments” and “Regulation” and “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n.”\nOur Community \nFedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources, and network. Through FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program, we support non-profit organizations working to solve social challenges relevant to our business, customers, and team members. We pair donations with charitable shipping and access to our global network, team member volunteers, subject matter expertise, influence, and connections to meet social and business goals. We make our biggest investments in areas where we can address significant issues and apply our unique business \n-17-\ncapabilities. Real change takes significant investment, authentic support for communities, and a commitment to continuous learning. FedEx Cares focuses on four major giving pillars:\n•\nDelivering for Good:\n FedEx comes to the aid of people around the world when they need it most — during times of disaster and crisis. We support best-in-class humanitarian aid nonprofits and use our expansive network to quickly deliver lifesaving and complex shipments that benefit our communities. \n•\nEmpowering Entrepreneurs:\n We empower entrepreneurs from all backgrounds with the training, connections, and other resources they need to compete in the global marketplace more effectively, expand their customer base, generate new jobs, and create a better life for themselves and their communities.\n•\nAdvancing Climate Solutions:\n To help us deliver a more sustainable future, we support research and start-ups to advance long-term climate solutions. We also support initiatives that promote a more circular economy and local conservation efforts to help communities adapt to climate change. \n•\nEngaging People & Communities:\n Addressing local needs and societal challenges in communities globally is important to us. We collaborate with nonprofits that strive to ensure access to opportunities for everyone, while also encouraging our employees to contribute by volunteering. Our goal is to cultivate a brighter and more inclusive future for all.\nTogether, we multiply our impact to improve the communities where we live and work. Additionally, FedEx supports communities throughout the U.S. with its FedEx Cares Employee Giving program.\nWe believe the investments we make in our communities today, combined with team member engagement, set the stage for a brighter tomorrow. For additional information on our community involvement and our FedEx Cares strategy, visit fedexcares.com.\nThe Environment \nWith such an expansive global network, managing for consequential environmental progress at FedEx requires a wide-ranging plan, strategic investment, and measured action. Building on decades of environmental progress, in 2021 we set our ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality by calendar 2040 across our global operations’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our Scope 3 contracted transportation emissions.\nWe continue to deploy a three-part strategy to meet our calendar 2040 goal, which covers the comprehensive, long-term actions needed within our own operations, but also to support the low-carbon transition of the transportation and logistics industry as a whole.\n•\nDecarbonize what’s possible:\n includes leveraging today’s cost-effective technology to reduce our emissions, such as more fuel-efficient aircraft and electric pickup-and-delivery vehicles.\n•\nCo-create with purpose:\n includes working with various stakeholders to innovate future needed solutions, such as low-emission heavy duty transportation vehicles.\n•\nNeutralize what’s left:\n utilizing durable carbon credits to offset remaining emissions in the latter part of the next decade. \nWe align our assessment and reporting approach with the recommendations from the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and applicable mandatory disclosure requirements. Evaluation of climate-related physical and transition risk is integrated into our enterprise risk management process, which identifies and reports top enterprise risks in the short-, medium-, and long-term through industry research, surveys, and workshops with business leaders. Based on the risks identified, specific contingency plans and strategies are formulated to minimize potential adverse effects on our business. Our investment in and pursuit of a more efficient network and operations, including Network 2.0 and our ongoing air network redesign, support our efforts to create a more connected and sustainable future. We have demonstrated our capabilities to reduce environmental impacts by achieving operational synergies such as improving the efficiency of our fleet, reducing miles driven, and minimizing route redundancies. \nHowever, we recognize that our reduction efforts alone will not be enough to reach our goal of carbon-neutral operations. For this reason, we have helped establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture, empowering Yale scientists to rapidly advance research on nature-based, durable carbon dioxide removal solutions. We believe that supporting a robust pipeline of solutions via this initiative will help add future supply of carbon credits that are measurable, verifiable, and durable to both the compliance and voluntary marketplace.\nVehicle Electrification\nAcross FedEx, we aim to create an efficient and sustainable fleet tailored to our operational and customer needs. In selecting the ideal vehicle solution for each application, we carefully consider local regulatory requirements, manufacturing options, vehicle use, and operating and maintenance costs. Electrification and alternative fuels present a significant opportunity to reduce the environmental \n-18-\nimpact of our global ground fleet further, which includes more than 200,000 motorized vehicles across several vehicle classes, including pickup-and-delivery vehicles, long-haul trucks, forklifts, airport ground services equipment, and other off-road vehicles. \nThe continued growth of e-commerce means that the electrification of our pickup-and-delivery fleet presents a significant opportunity to address last-mile emissions and support our long-term business. We continue to work toward meeting our target of having 50% of all FedEx pickup-and-delivery purchase orders be electric in calendar 2025 and 100% be electric by calendar 2030. We will continue to take a phased approach to achieve our goal of an all-electric pickup-and-delivery fleet by calendar 2040 while continuing to fine-tune the size and makeup of our fleet. Additionally, we implement fuel-saving measures within our current fleet to help reduce our environmental impact.\nAs we work toward electrifying our vehicle fleet, making sure we can have adequate charging infrastructure available at our facilities is a priority. We have already built over 1,000 charging stations across our global facilities to support the electrification of our own pickup-and-delivery fleet and the electric vehicle transition of service providers. The electrification of our long-haul fleet poses unique challenges since these vehicles travel long distances and need to be recharged at our centers and potentially in multiple locations along a route, which can require a significant amount of time and energy at facility charging stations. Our vehicles and facilities teams are working with power utilities, government officials, and regulatory agencies to plot a path forward and meet the additional grid capacity and charging challenges.\nOur transition to one FedEx has changed our fleet makeup and vehicle dispersion, bringing new opportunities. In 2024, we achieved 40% improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency compared to a 2005 baseline. Due to changes in the mix of vehicles needed as a result of Network 2.0 and other ongoing strategic initiatives, we do not believe we will be able to achieve our goal of a 50% increase in vehicle fuel efficiency by calendar 2025. We continue to review and optimize our sustainability strategies regarding surface operations to determine our best path towards our goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations by calendar 2040.\nSustainable Aviation Fuels\nOur owned aircraft operations are the largest contributor to our emissions footprint and aviation fuel also represents one of our largest expenses. For more than a decade, we have actively deployed substantial resources to mitigate these impacts including fuel conservation, modernizing our air fleet, and sourcing cost-competitive SAF. In 2025, we began to take delivery of over three million gallons of blended SAF in our U.S. operations in continued pursuit of our goal to procure 30% of jet fuel from a blend of alternative sources by calendar 2030. In addition, we comply with SAF mandates in different regions around the world. We continue to actively work to help improve the world’s supply of SAF, which is not nearly at the scale needed to meet the demands of the aviation sector. While FedEx works extensively to conserve jet fuel and modernize our air fleet, our carbon neutral ambition relies on reducing emissions with SAF and carbon sequestration to remove and store excess carbon. Advancing these nascent technologies and markets requires extensive collaboration with industry, academia, non-governmental organizations, and governments. \nTo accelerate SAF solutions, we are proud members of the Aviation Sector working group of the First Movers Coalition, a global initiative dedicated to decarbonizing challenging industrial sectors, including the aviation industry. We also advocate for responsible policies and incentives to advance alternative fuel technologies, expedite global SAF production, and enhance the availability and affordability of low-carbon fuel. We acknowledge the complexities faced by the aviation industry in achieving large-scale SAF deployment and recognize the potential need for additional solutions to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions. \nAircraft Fuel Conservation and Aircraft Fleet Modernization\nAt FedEx, we are working to minimize the environmental footprint of our aircraft fleet through fuel conservation, airline route optimization, and the exploration of more sustainable or efficient transportation options within our extensive network. We are proud to have achieved a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a calendar 2005 baseline. We first established this goal in calendar 2008, with a target of a 20% reduction by calendar 2020 from a calendar 2005 baseline. After meeting that goal ahead of schedule, we later revised our target to a 30% reduction in emissions intensity by calendar 2020. While the global increase in shipping volume generated by the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the retirement of certain aircraft and led us to fall short of that goal in calendar 2020, we have now achieved this target. In 2024, we saved 130 million gallons and 11.1 million gallons of jet fuel through our aircraft modernization initiatives and FedEx Fuel Sense program, respectively.\nWe are dedicated to modernizing our fleet of nearly 700 aircraft to reduce costs, enhance reliability and operational adaptability, improve fuel efficiency, and minimize emissions. We continue to replace older aircraft with more fuel-efficient models to reduce GHG emissions, air pollution, and local noise pollution. We are currently scheduled to take delivery of seven Boeing 767F, three ATR-72 600F, and 19 Cessna 408 aircraft by the end of 2026. During 2025, Federal Express exercised options to purchase eight B777F aircraft and ten ATR 72-600F aircraft. Of the eight B777F aircraft, three are expected to be delivered in calendar year 2026 and five are expected to be delivered in calendar year 2027. Of the ten ATR 72-600F aircraft, three are expected to be delivered in calendar year 2027, four in calendar year 2028, and three in calendar year 2029. Delays could impact these timelines. Additionally, in 2025, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 aircraft, including two Boeing 757-200 aircraft, seven Airbus A300-600 aircraft, and three Boeing MD-11 aircraft, and eight related engines. We plan to retire the entire Boeing MD-11 fleet by the end of \n-19-\n2032. These retirements are aligned with the company’s fleet reduction and modernization strategy as the company continues to improve its global network efficiency and better align air network capacity with anticipated demand. For more information about our expected future aircraft deliveries, see “\nItem 2. Properties\n” of this Annual Report under the caption “Federal Express Segment” and \nNote 1\n5\n of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nFacilities\nWe work to support the long-term health and well-being of our business, the planet, and the communities in which we operate through the sustainable operations of our more than 5,000 air and ground hubs, local stations, freight service centers, and retail locations. Our transition to one FedEx and implementation of Network 2.0 will support our sustainability efforts through the minimization of operational redundancies and reduction in our overall physical footprint.\nAs we support electric vehicle deployment and charging infrastructure, our energy demand will increase. In response to this challenge, we invest in both on- and off-site renewable energy generation and procurement of renewable energy. Given the complexity of grid systems, different real estate models, utility markets, and a varied regulatory landscape, the viability of on-site renewable energy differs by facility. The pace of these investments is designed to grow in the coming years to address our increased electricity demands. We have set new mid-term renewable energy goals through calendar 2033 as we advance to our goal of having all electricity used at our facilities from renewable sources by calendar 2040. Our approach to innovating operations involves continued investments in energy efficiency and management, renewable energy procurement, facility resiliency, environmental compliance and waste reduction, among other initiatives. For new facilities, we integrate energy efficiency specifications and explore on-site renewable energy generation options into the design. \nWe are committed to embedding resiliency in our operations as the physical risks of climate change increase, causing extreme weather events, strain on electricity grids, and higher energy costs. We invest in infrastructure reinforcement to meet growing electricity demand and evolving renewable generation standards, in addition to mitigating the potential for storm damage. We also continuously enhance our contingency planning to address the impacts of severe weather more quickly. We strive to reduce the waste we generate and recycle waste when possible. We challenge our individual team members to find new ways to improve efficiencies and equip them with Quality Driven Management (“QDM”) tools to assist in identifying waste. QDM tools are designed to drive continuous improvement and, in many cases, successful ideas become integrated across our networks.\nSustainable Customer Solutions\nWe recognize that transporting goods for our customers can lead to environmental impacts through emissions and waste generation. We embed circularity principles into our package design to minimize our environmental impact while protecting shipments from damage and loss. Our more sustainable packaging choices, such as the resealable Reusable Padded Pak, give our customers more choice to reduce waste associated with their shipping and returns. To help us source our packaging materials responsibly, we seek relevant third-party certifications and review these certifications bi-annually. In calendar 2024, 74% of FedEx packaging materials were from third-party certified sources. The FedEx Sourcing team also conducts annual reviews of our critical supplier’s environmental management practices and sustainability programs, including recommending improvement areas.\nOur FedEx\n®\n Sustainability Insights (“FSI”) tool gives our customers and suppliers access to estimated CO\n2\ne emissions data associated with their FedEx shipments, from the individual package to account levels, enabling them to understand their environmental impact and drive informed supply chain decisions. This tool enables greater transparency for customers to inform their emissions reporting, understand their carbon footprint, and make informed decisions about their shipping patterns. Additionally, U.S.-based customers can forecast future emissions through predictive modeling capabilities. FSI is third-party verified to adhere to the GHG Protocol and Global Logistics Emissions Council framework. Launched globally in 2024, FedEx\n®\n Sustainability Insights is currently translated into more than 30 languages and available in over 100 markets. Since July 2023, over 13,000 customers have generated emissions reports from the tool. Providing our customers with this level of information empowers them to gain a better understanding of their Scope 3 emissions generated from their shipping activities with us and to plan ahead for future improvements.\nFor additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see \nfedex.com/en-us/sustainability.html\n. For additional information regarding environmental, climate, and weather-related regulation and risks, see “Regulation” above and “\nItem \n1\nA. Risk Factors\n” under “Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks.”\nGovernance\nThe FedEx Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of independent directors and is committed to the highest quality corporate governance and accountability to stockholders. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) and our Code of Conduct, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes it deems appropriate to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code of Conduct, which apply to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available under the Corporate Governance heading under “Governance” \n-20-\non the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.fedex.com. We will post under the Corporate Governance heading on the Investor Relations page of our website information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code of Conduct to the extent such disclosure is required. \nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock. Although the risks below are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. \nMacroeconomic and Market Risks\nWe are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical developments.\n While macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of global trade growth — key macroeconomic measurements influenced by, among other things: inflation and deflation; international trade policies and relations; supply chain disruptions; interest rates and currency exchange rates; labor costs and unemployment levels; fuel and energy prices; inventory levels; spending patterns (including shifts from goods to services and vice versa); disposable income; debt levels; credit availability; political uncertainty; public health crises; and geopolitical tensions or conflicts. When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies move manufacturing closer to consumer markets and expand the number of distribution centers, we transport goods shorter distances, which adversely affects our yields and results of operations. Certain manufacturers and retailers are making investments to produce and store goods in closer proximity to supply chains and consumers. Additionally, in 2025, we continued to see customer preference for slower, less costly shipping services and experienced lower fuel surcharges at FedEx Freight and reduced demand surcharges at Federal Express. We expect service mix to shift further toward deferred service offerings in 2026. Further, the scale of our operations and our relatively high fixed-cost structure, particularly with respect to our air network, make it difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. For more information, see “Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.” below. \nThe decline in U.S. imports of consumer goods that started in late 2022, along with slowed global industrial production, has contributed to continued weakened business conditions for the transportation industry, leading to lower freight and package volumes. Additionally, recent changes in U.S. and international trade policy, along with continued uncertainty surrounding such policies, could lead to further weakened business conditions for the transportation industry. We also continue to experience pressure on demand for our transportation services, particularly our priority services, from the impact of elevated inflation and interest rates on consumer and business spending. See “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information.\nMoreover, given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including international taxes, government-to-government relations, the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets, and geopolitical risks such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East or escalations thereof, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, services in Ukraine remain limited, services in Belarus remain suspended, and we have exited our operations in Russia. While these conflicts have not had, and we do not expect these conflicts to have, a direct material effect on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences of these conflicts, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes;\n potential retaliatory action by foreign governments and other groups against us; increased tensions between the United States and countries\n in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict’s effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted. Geopolitical uncertainty negatively affected our results of operations in recent years. \nTo the extent the continued conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, or subsequent similar conflicts, adversely affect our business, they may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack; adverse changes in international trade policies; increased costs and unavailability of fuel; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly with regard to our international business; \ndisruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; \nour ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; terrorist activities targeting transportation infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. \n-21-\nAdditional changes in international trade policies, including with respect to tariffs, and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally, increase our costs, and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. \nThe U.S. government has taken certain actions that have negatively affected U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on many goods imported into the United States. Additionally, many foreign governments have imposed, and others have threatened to impose, tariffs on certain goods imported from the United States. These actions have contributed to weakness in the global economy that has adversely affected our results of operations. Increased tariffs may lead to lower levels of trade or heightened political tensions. Additional changes to global trade policies could lead to increased tariffs, export controls, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions, which may lead to increased prices or trade limitations for goods transported globally, potentially reducing customer demand for our services. See “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information.\nAdditionally, the U.S. government has taken action to limit the ability of domestic companies to engage in commerce with certain foreign entities under certain circumstances, and foreign governments may investigate our compliance with these restrictions. Furthermore, given the nature of our business and our global recognizability, foreign governments may target FedEx by limiting the ability of foreign entities to do business with us in certain instances, imposing monetary or other penalties or taking other retaliatory action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.\nOur transportation businesses and their profitability are affected by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel, as well as our ability to collect fuel surcharges.\n We must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. In addition, our purchased transportation expense is affected by fuel costs. To date, we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense effect of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason, fuel costs could adversely affect our operating results. Lower fuel prices have negatively affected yields through lower fuel surcharges at each of our transportation segments in recent years. See “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information. As of May 31, 2025, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations, and we currently have no plans to use derivative financial instruments for this purpose in the future.\nEven if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higher-yielding express services to our lower-yielding deferred or ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. In addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative effect on our ability to operate our transportation networks. The following factors may affect fuel supply and could result in shortages and price increases in the future: weather-related events; natural disasters; political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries; economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants; changes in governmental policy concerning fuel production, transportation, taxes, or marketing; changes in refining capacity; sustainability concerns; cyberattacks; and public and investor sentiment.\nOperating Risks\nThe failure to successfully execute our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0 and Tricolor, in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results. \nIn 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve long-term profitability. The program includes Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada, as well as Tricolor, the redesign of the Federal Express international air network to improve efficiency and asset utilization. See “\nItem 1. Business\n” and “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information. \nThere can be no assurance that the Federal Express and legacy FedEx Ground businesses and networks, which historically operated separately and independently, can successfully be fully integrated as planned. Additionally, it is possible that the business and network integration and optimization process could result in higher-than-currently-expected costs, less-than-expected savings, the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, union organizing, litigation, legal disputes with service providers, governmental agency challenges, the loss of key employees or service providers, or other unexpected issues. It is also possible that the overall process will take longer than currently anticipated. Additionally, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in order to realize the anticipated timing and projected benefits of our transformation initiatives:\n•\nour ability to maintain coverage of U.S. employees at Federal Express under the RLA and successfully manage challenges to the employment status of drivers employed by service providers utilized in certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, in addition to other labor-related risks;\n•\ncombining the Federal Express and legacy FedEx Ground physical networks and operations, including consolidating or optimizing pickup-and-delivery and linehaul operations; \n-22-\n•\nintegrating, consolidating, and implementing new administrative and back-office support functions, information-technology infrastructure, and computer systems; \n•\nintegrating and unifying the offerings and services available to FedEx customers;\n•\nharmonizing certain operating practices; human resource management practices such as employee recruitment, development, and compensation programs; internal controls; and other policies, procedures, and processes;\n•\nmaintaining or amending existing agreements with customers and service providers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and service providers; \n•\nlegal challenges by service providers or governmental agencies seeking to slow or stop plans related to Network 2.0;\n•\naddressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies; \n•\naddressing employee issues so as to promote retention and maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relations; \n•\nmaintaining access to ports of call and railroads for intermodal support;\n•\nmanaging the movement of certain positions to different locations; \n•\nobtaining any required regulatory licenses, operating authority, or contractual consents;\n•\nmanaging unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration process; and\n•\nmitigating the potential distraction and diversion of resources and of management’s time and attention associated with the planned spin-off of FedEx Freight.\nWe may be unable to achieve the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our transformation initiatives. The actual amount and timing of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from our current expectations and estimates. These initiatives and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and deferred tax balances and subject us to litigation. If we are not able to successfully implement our DRIVE transformation, our future financial results will suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals. \nAll of these factors could adversely affect FedEx’s results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on our transformation initiatives and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our business. \nA significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical sensitive or confidential information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations.\n Our ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, execute our DRIVE transformation, and compete effectively increasingly depend in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers (including personal information), and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations. For example, we rely on information technology to receive shipment information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, both random and targeted, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, malware attack, or denial-of-service attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and hacktivists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, “Acts of God,” transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information. \nThe technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition. For example, ShopRunner, which we acquired in 2021, collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and \n-23-\nusers of its applications. Additionally, it uses third-party service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers. These service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data and/or other confidential information. The foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of a data breach. \nWe also depend on and interact with the technology and systems of third parties, including our customers and third-party service providers such as cloud service providers and delivery services. Certain third parties host, process, or have access to information we maintain about our company, customers, employees, and vendors and/or operate systems that are critical to our business operations and services. Like us, these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches, cyberattacks, and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt, or close down their networks or systems. We have security processes, protocols, and standards in place, including contractual provisions requiring such security measures, that are applicable to such third parties and are designed to protect information that is held by them, or to which they have access, as a result of their engagements with us. A cyberattack has and may in the future defeat one or more of such third parties’ security measures, allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company, customers, employees, and vendors or disrupt our operations. Certain third parties also have and may in the future experience operational disruptions or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information. See “Failure of third-party service providers to perform as expected, or disruptions in our relationships with those providers or their provision of services to FedEx, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.” below for more information. In 2025, the information systems of one of our third-party service providers experienced a security breach that resulted in unauthorized access to the third-party’s cloud environment, including certain systems that contained our data. This incident did not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that similar events will not have such an effect in the future.\nFrom time to time we experience disruptions to our complex, global technology infrastructure, including our computer systems and websites. Such events could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information; require substantial repairs or replacements, resulting in significant costs; and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customers of some or all of their business to our competitors. The foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, customer service, and results of operations. Additionally, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created. These types of adverse effects could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company and customer information was compromised due to a data loss by FedEx or a trusted third party.\nWe or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Even if we detect a cybersecurity incident, the nature and extent of the incident may not be immediately clear. It may also not be clear how best to contain and remediate any harm caused by the cybersecurity incident, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Based on the sophistication of threat actors and the size and complexity of our information systems and network environment, among other factors, an investigation into a cybersecurity incident could take a significant amount of time to complete. In addition, while the investigation of a cybersecurity incident is ongoing, we may not know the full extent of the harm caused by a threat actor, and such harm may spread both internally and to certain customers, vendors, or other third parties. Additionally, our logging capabilities and the logging capabilities of third parties are not always complete or sufficiently detailed, which could affect our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of security events. Given the age, size, and complexity of our network environment, operational technology, and computer systems, patches for certain vulnerabilities may not exist and, even where patches or other risk-mitigating activities are available, the development of patches or execution of risk-mitigating actions may not occur before an underlying vulnerability is exploited and results in the disruption of our operations or compromise of our information systems or data. A significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely or in hybrid models, which may heighten these risks. These risks may also be heightened by our DRIVE transformation and the planned spin-off of FedEx Freight into a separate, publicly traded company.\nFurthermore, we are subject to an increasing number of cybersecurity compliance and reporting obligations in different jurisdictions that vary in their scope and application, creating conflicting reporting requirements. These factors and the time spent to comply may inhibit our ability to quickly provide complete and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident to customers, counterparties, and regulators, as well as the public. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident on our business and results of operations. See “Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection.” for additional information on risks related to legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection.\nWe have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information-technology risk management, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans, including investments to retire and replace end-of-life systems. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent, intense, and sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions, data loss, and cyber-fraud, which could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2021 for information regarding the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack at TNT Express and immaterial cyber incidents we experienced in 2017 and 2018. \n-24-\nAdditionally, we and our third-party service providers, vendors, and suppliers have experienced repeated attempts by cyber criminals, some of which have been successful, to gain access to customer accounts for the purposes of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating items being transported in our network, fraudulently charging shipment fees to customer or franchisee accounts, and fraudulently sending e-mails to recipients purporting to be from FedEx. To date, none of these fraudulent cyber activities have caused a material disruption to our systems or resulted in any material costs to FedEx.\nOur security processes and initiatives may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future. Additionally, the rapid ongoing evolution and increased adoption of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning may make it more difficult to anticipate and implement protective measures to recognize, detect, and prevent the occurrence of any of the cyber events described above.\nWe are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations, and insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us. \nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. Our self-insurance accruals are primarily based on estimated costs determined by actuarial methods. Estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs, which may be subject to a high degree of variability. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years. Material increases in the magnitude of claims, changes to healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance retention levels, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. As a result, our insurance and claims costs could increase materially in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \nAs a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amounts we self-insure. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance, risk volatility, and premium expense. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or so-called “nuclear” verdicts, including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents and their families. See Note 9 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in “Item 1. Financial Statements” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August 31, 2022 for more information. Given this trend, it is possible that additional claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If another claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we would bear the excess in addition to our exposure not covered by excess insurance carriers.\nGiven the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. Accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase, or we could further increase our exposure not covered by excess insurance carriers as policies are renewed or replaced. Our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\nThe transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities.\n Because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. These security requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. For example, the TSA requires FedEx to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. The effects on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. Moreover, a terrorist attack directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely affect demand for our services. \nFailure of third-party service providers to perform as expected, or disruptions in our relationships with those providers or their provision of services to FedEx, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \nFedEx has engaged third-party service providers to perform certain functions that are integral to our business, including the provision of information technology infrastructure, application development, maintenance and support, and end-user support services\n. There can be no assurance that our third-party service providers will adhere to contractual service performance or compliance requirements, and such service providers may suffer disruptions to their systems, labor groups, or supply chains that could adversely affect their services. We may also have disagreements with such service providers, and related contracts may be terminated or may not be extended or renewed. Additionally, from time to time such service providers have engaged in fraudulent activities in the course of their business \n-25-\nrelationships with FedEx. Any of the foregoing could disrupt our operations and \nresult in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or results of operations. \nThe effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition are highly unpredictable.\n A widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis could have varying effects on the demand for our services, our business operations, and the global economy and supply chains. The extent of the effect of such an event on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the global economy, will be dictated by developments that cannot be predicted, such as its duration and spread; the success of efforts to contain it and treat its effects, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions; the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreaks and variant strains and the effect of actions taken in response; and the resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate. \nOur business is labor and capital intensive in nature, which may require us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during such an event. If we are unable to remain agile and flex our networks to align with shipping volumes, customer needs, disrupted global supply chains and other network inefficiencies, market demands, and operating conditions, or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policies, our business operations could be negatively affected, which could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, due to the size, scope, and geographically dispersed nature of our operations, the expenses we incur to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other industries.\nTo the extent a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade policies and relations; our ability to execute our DRIVE transformation, implement our business strategy, and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences; our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs; our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; and the effect of litigation or claims from customers, team members, suppliers, regulators, or other third parties relating to the crisis or our actions in response. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended May 31, 2020, May 31, 2021, May 31, 2022, and May 31, 2023 for information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFailure to complete the adjustment of our air network to remove costs related to services previously provided to the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) could adversely affect our profitability.\n The contract for Federal Express to provide the USPS transportation services within the United States expired by its terms on September 29, 2024, and Federal Express continued to provide air transportation services domestically and to Puerto Rico through the contract’s expiration. If we are unable to complete the adjustment of our air network to remove costs related to the services previously provided to the USPS, our profitability could be negatively affected. \nStrategic Risks\nFailure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer. \nWe are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, such as those related to our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0 and Tricolor. See “The failure to successfully execute our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0 and Tricolor, in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results.” above and\n \n“\nItem 1. Business\n” and “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for additional information. In addition, we are investing in data insight solutions intended to drive supply chain efficiency for our customers.\nSuch initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses. We have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy. We may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, digital revenue growth, and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions. For example, in June 2024, Federal Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. See “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n” of this Annual Report for more information. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. The actual amount and timing of business optimization costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. If we are not able to successfully implement this plan, our future financial results may suffer.\n-26-\nFurther, in developing our business strategy, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and the mix of services to be purchased by our customers, the future rate of e-commerce growth and inventory restocking, passenger airline cargo capacity, competition, and the global economy, and actual market, economic, and other conditions may be different from our assumptions. As technology (including artificial intelligence and machine learning), customer behavior, and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in technology, customer preferences, and market dynamics, our future financial results will suffer. For additional discussion, see “\nItem 1. Business\n” of this Annual Report under the caption “Strategy.”\nThe planned spin-off of FedEx Freight may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and there is no guarantee that the spin-off, if completed, will achieve the intended financial and strategic benefits. \nIn December 2024, we announced our intention to separate FedEx Freight from our portfolio structure through the creation of a separate, publicly traded company (“NewCo”). The planned separation, which would be implemented through the spin-off of shares of NewCo to FedEx stockholders, is expected to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes for FedEx stockholders and be completed by June 2026. Completion of the planned spin-off is subject to the final approval of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends, the receipt and continuing validity of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and/or favorable opinions of our U.S. tax advisors with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, the receipt of other regulatory and contractual approvals, and the availability of financing for NewCo on satisfactory terms. The proposed spin-off is complex in nature, and unanticipated changes or developments could delay or prevent the completion of the spin-off or cause the spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected. Whether or not we complete the spin-off, we may face significant challenges in connection with the transaction, including, without limitation:\n•\nthe diversion of the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategy and long-term planning and of our management and employees from day-to-day operations;\n•\nour ability to maintain NewCo’s continued support of our DRIVE transformation, Network 2.0, Tricolor, and other strategic initiatives;\n•\nour ability to maintain operational, commercial, data and information technology, brand and intellectual property, human resources, finance, legal, sales, and marketing continuity where necessary between FedEx and NewCo and establish stand-alone functions and infrastructure at NewCo where necessary;\n•\nthe risk that if the IRS determines that certain steps of the planned spin-off do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, FedEx and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities;\n•\ncosts and expenses related to the planned spin-off (which are expected to be significant), including costs related to commercial and operational dis-synergies; restructuring and other transaction expenses; expenses related to establishing stand-alone operational, commercial, personnel, and digital and technology infrastructure at NewCo; and accounting, tax, legal, and other professional services expenses, any of which may be higher than initially expected;\n•\nretaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees, and other counterparties;\n•\naddressing employee issues so as to promote retention and motivation and maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relations;\n•\nobtaining any required regulatory licenses, operating authority, or contractual consents;\n•\ndetermining the appropriate allocations of assets and liabilities between FedEx and NewCo, as well as the terms governing the relationship between FedEx and NewCo following the spin-off; and\n•\npotential negative reactions from investors and other external stakeholders.\nThere can be no assurance that the spin-off, if completed, will achieve the intended financial and strategic benefits (which are based on a number of assumptions, some or all of which may prove to be incorrect) or provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock, or that the dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related restructuring transactions) will not exceed the anticipated amounts. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the uncertainties described above. Changes in the stockholder base of FedEx and/or NewCo following the planned spin-off could also cause the price of either company’s common stock to fluctuate. \nIf the planned spin-off occurs, FedEx and NewCo will each be smaller, less diversified companies with more concentrated areas of focus. As a result, FedEx and NewCo may become more vulnerable to changing macroeconomic and market conditions; the results of \n-27-\noperations, cash flows, effective tax rate, and other financial and operating metrics of each company may be subject to increased volatility; and the ability of each company to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends, and service debt may be diminished.\nTo the extent challenges related to the planned spin-off of NewCo adversely affect our business, they may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in our Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and the price of our common stock. Such risks include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our DRIVE transformation, Network 2.0, and broader business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences; disruptions to our technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack; our ability to attract and retain employee talent and maintain our company culture; our ability to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; and our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.\nWe depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.\n FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability, and speed. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of corporate responsibility, governance, and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful tools for sales, marketing, and recruitment, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity or sensationalism across media channels (whether or not justified) relating to activities including, but not limited to, the following by our team members or others with whom we do business (over whom we may have little or no control) could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand and goodwill: customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us or our service providers; low safety or service levels; data breaches, cyberattacks, or technology infrastructure disruptions; utilization of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence; allegations of noncompliance with laws or claims that result in litigation; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; labor relations and workforce reductions or disruptions; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; our sustainability goals and related progress; our political activities and expenditures; or our executive compensation practices. \nWith the increase in the use of artificial intelligence and social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and other platforms, adverse publicity, whether warranted or not, can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Certain forms of technology such as artificial intelligence also allow users to alter or create images, videos, and other information relating to FedEx and present the information in a false or misleading manner that seems real. Further, our actual or perceived position, lack of position, or perceived lack of transparency on environmental, social, political, public policy, labor relations, or other sensitive issues could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers, stockholders, team members, advocacy groups, government representatives, and regulatory bodies. Expectations regarding these matters continue to evolve and are not uniform. Although we try to adapt and maintain a balance that satisfies all of these stakeholders, we may not always be able or choose to move as quickly or in the direction that various competing interests desire or demand, which could adversely impact our reputation. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand and goodwill. \nWe face intense competition.\n The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We face intense competition from global air freight forwarders for air freight business. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations. For example, Amazon has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles, recently began offering an LTL freight service for inbound shipments to its distribution facilities, and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See “\nItem 1. Business\n” of this Annual Report for additional information.\nWe believe we compete effectively with these companies — for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings, if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or better service levels, more effectively bundle their services, or offer services at lower prices, it could adversely affect our results of operations. Continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition. Moreover, if high-volume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we provide, it may reduce our revenue and \n-28-\ncould negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. These effects could be exacerbated if high-volume package shippers offer such capabilities to third parties. News regarding such developments or expansions could also negatively affect the price of our common stock. \nOur industry may be affected by changes in technology and our competitors may implement emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence applications, more quickly and more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Advancements in technology, such as advanced safety systems; automated package sorting, handling, and delivery; autonomous delivery; third-party supply chain insight and management; artificial intelligence; vehicle platooning; alternative fuel vehicles; and digitization of freight services, may necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments. See “We may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040.” below for additional information.\nOur businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.\n We make significant investments in aircraft, package handling facilities, vehicles, technology, sort equipment, acquired companies, and other assets to support our transportation and business networks. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. We must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed based on projections of volume levels and fleet requirements, which have become more difficult to make in light of recent macroeconomic, international trade and geopolitical uncertainty and volatility. Missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. Overcapacity could lead to below-market asset dispositions or write-downs, as well as negatively affect operating margins, and undercapacity could negatively affect service levels. See “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n — Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results\n — Asset Impairment Charges” of this Annual Report for information regarding the noncash impairment charges recorded in 2025 and 2024 in connection with our decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines from service.\nOur inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances and investments could materially adversely affect us.\n Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity, and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and investments, form joint ventures or strategic alliances, and realize the expected benefits from these transactions. We regularly acquire businesses, enter into strategic alliances, and make investments across the more than 220 countries and territories in which we provide services.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special commercial, customer, accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology, human resources, cultural, and other risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies. Additionally, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures and/or incur certain operating expenses following the completion of certain transactions, which may be higher than initially expected. For example, existing and future customer data and processes in the systems of FedEx and ShopRunner may require significant added expense to integrate. While we expect our past and future acquisitions and strategic transactions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our business and long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all, or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired businesses, including their goodwill or other intangible assets. We have previously incurred goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions, some of which have been material, and may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future.\nHuman Resource Management Risks\nLabor-related disruptions and potential changes in labor laws may adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nOur business is labor intensive in nature, utilizing large numbers of numerous classes of employees and service providers. Despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions, our employees in the U.S. and Canada, except our pilots, are not unionized (we acquired FedEx Supply Chain in 2015, which already had a small number of unionized employees). Additionally, certain of our employees outside of the U.S. and Canada are unionized. For information regarding our continued bargaining efforts to reach an agreement with the union representing our pilots, see “\nItem 1. Business\n” of this Annual Report under the caption “Federal Express Segment — Employees.” If we are unable to reach an agreement with any of our unionized work groups in future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, or if additional groups within our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLabor unions have recently attempted to organize employees at businesses and in industries that have not traditionally been unionized, and in certain instances have been successful. Such attempts could continue in 2026. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that legislative or administrative actions, or judicial decisions, could attempt to remove Federal Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA. Additionally, this jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our recently completed one FedEx consolidation and ongoing Network 2.0 transformation. For additional discussion of the RLA, see “\nItem 1. Business\n” of this Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.” Such legislation or challenge could expose our customers to the type \n-29-\nof service disruptions that the RLA was designed to prevent — local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of time-sensitive, high-value goods throughout our global network. Such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets. \nThere is also the possibility that Congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our operations with employees governed by the NLRA. In addition, the NMB and the NLRB have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, as well as vendor, service provider, and supplier workforces, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. Finally, changes to federal or state laws, regulations, rules, judicial or administrative precedent, or guidance governing employee classification could affect the status of service providers as independent employers of their drivers. If we are deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these service providers, labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially, and we could incur significant capital outlays and experience adverse effects to service levels. \nOur failure to attract and retain employee talent, meet our purchased transportation needs, or maintain our company culture, as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nOur success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our high-quality employees, many of whom are longstanding FedEx team members. Difficulties in motivating, rewarding, recruiting, and retaining employee talent, including members of senior management and successors to members of senior management; failure to protect members of senior management from security threats (which certain executive officers have experienced in the past); the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base; and/or our inability to successfully transition key roles could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and the price of our common stock. We also regularly seek to hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers, and utilize service providers to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.\nCertain positions at FedEx have historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased recruiting, training, and retention costs. Additionally, our company culture is important to providing high-quality customer service and having a productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our evolving operations and other factors. If we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture, our competitive ability and our business may be harmed.\nOur business is labor intensive, and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified service providers and persons in the markets where we and our service providers operate and unemployment levels within these markets, prevailing and competitive wage rates and other benefits, health and other insurance costs, inflation, fuel and energy prices and availability, behavioral changes, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations (including increased minimum wage requirements) or government programs, safety, and security levels of our operations, our reputation within the labor and transportation markets, changes in the business or financial soundness of service providers, interest in contracting with FedEx, and the effect of a widespread public health crisis. Additionally, certain service providers (acting collectively or in coordination in some instances) may seek to increase financial rates or modify contract terms and may refuse to provide service to FedEx.\nOur inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation needs can increase our costs, hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, negatively affect service levels, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Certain of these risks may be heightened by our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and the planned spin-off of FedEx Freight.\nWe contract with service providers to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these service providers as direct and exclusive employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged.\n We are defending joint-employer cases where it is alleged that we should be treated as an employer or joint employer of the drivers employed by service providers with whom we contract to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations. We incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of service providers as direct and exclusive employers of their drivers. We continue to believe that we are not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. However, adverse determinations in these matters or regulatory developments could, among other things, entitle service providers’ drivers to certain wage payments and penalties from the service providers and FedEx, and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx. The status of the drivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with Network 2.0.\nPotential changes to pilot flight and duty time regulations could impair our operations and impose substantial costs on us\n. \nIn 2010, the FAA proposed regulations that would change the flight and duty time rules applicable to all-cargo air carriers. When the FAA issued final regulations in 2011 (the “2011 regulations”), all-cargo carriers, including FedEx, were exempt from these new requirements. Instead, all-cargo carriers were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management systems to develop fatigue mitigations unique to each operation. In 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all-cargo carriers from the 2011 regulations, and litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the FAA’s decision. However, this issue remains a policy priority for certain labor groups, and the U.S. Congress periodically considers legislation that, if adopted, would require all-cargo carriers to comply with the 2011 regulations. Required compliance with the 2011 regulations would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial costs on us in order to maintain operational reliability.\n-30-\nIncreasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements, and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \nWe sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans. The costs of providing pension and other retirement benefit plans are dependent on numerous assumptions, such as discount rates, expected long-term investment returns on plan assets, future salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the rules for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex, involve numerous assumptions, and can produce volatility in our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For example, we recognized a pre-tax, noncash MTM gain of $515 million in 2025 ($390 million, net of tax, or $1.60 per diluted share). For additional information on our MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments, see “\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and F\ninancial Condition\n — Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results\n — Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments” and \nNote 14\n of the consolidated financial statements included in “",
