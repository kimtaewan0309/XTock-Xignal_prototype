We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations.\nU.S.\nWe educate healthcare providers about our products in various ways, including promoting in online channels, distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians, and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S., and we maintain websites and other media channels (e.g., social media) with information about our major products. Promotion of our major products in the U.S. includes engagement by employee or contracted sales representatives with physicians and other healthcare professionals.\nOur account managers service wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations to provide discounts or rebates on our products.\nIn the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—McKesson Corporation, Cencora, Inc., and Cardinal Health, Inc.—each accounted for a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years. For additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2: Revenue.\"\nWe recently launched LillyDirect, a direct-to-consumer digital health care platform designed to, among other things, provide patients in the U.S. living with obesity, migraine and diabetes with tools to help them access care from independent healthcare providers, as well as the option for home delivery of select prescribed Lilly medicines through third-party pharmacies. Programs to assist patients in adhering to treatment plans are also available for use. We have launched, and continue to explore, new partnerships and tools, including through LillyDirect, to expand access to our medicines. New initiatives may expose us to new risks or exacerbate existing risks. See, for examples, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Failure, inadequacy, breach of, or unauthorized access to, our IT systems or those of our third-party service providers, unauthorized access to our confidential information, or violations of data protection laws, could each result in material harm to our \n7\nbusiness and reputation\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Litigation and Government Regulation—Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.\"\nOutside the U.S.\nThe products we market and their distribution vary from country to country. Outside the U.S., we promote our products to healthcare providers through sales representatives and other channels. We maintain our own sales organizations in many countries. We also often utilize third parties for commercial sales operations, some of which are engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements.\nMarketing Collaborations\nCertain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example, we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products, including Jardiance, Glyxambi, Synjardy, and Trijardy XR. \nFor additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"\nCompetition\nOur products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets. \nImportant competitive factors include effectiveness, safety, availability, ease of use, and overall patient experience; formulary placement, price, payer coverage and reimbursement rates, and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; regulatory approvals; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products, processes, modalities, indications, and uses. Early market entry and rapid patient access can also be important to achieve product acceptance and success. Barriers to reimbursable patient access in some cases include default payer coverage restrictions for our medicines. For example, in the U.S., anti-obesity medicines are often excluded from commercial benefit plans. Self-insured employers must opt in for coverage of these medicines. Medicare and payers in various international markets also have not covered anti-obesity medicines for weight loss. Our anti-obesity medicines comprise a significant portion of our revenues, and barriers to reimbursable patient access may impact our sales volumes, business, and results of operations.\nMost new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded, biosimilar, or generic products already on the market or that are later developed. When new products, uses, or delivery systems with therapeutic, convenience, or cost advantages are introduced, including by developing new modalities, our existing products become subject to decreased sales volumes, progressive price reductions, or both. \nWe believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing or acquiring innovative, cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers, and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products, and it is possible that our products or indications will be, or will become, uncompetitive from time to time. See also \"—Competition—U.S. Private Sector Dynamics.\"\nGeneric Pharmaceuticals, Biosimilars, and Compounding\nGeneric Pharmaceuticals and Biosimilars\nGeneric pharmaceuticals and biosimilars can pose major competitive challenges to our business. In most major jurisdictions, the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the branded product's revenue in a very short period of time. Moreover, governments in some countries leverage generic entrants to drive price concessions through the utilization of volume-based procurement bidding and other measures.\n8\nFurther, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to branded products. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generics that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a branded product. Where substitution is mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In certain countries, intellectual property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic versions of our products at or relatively shortly after launch.\nIn addition, competition for our biologics, which constitute a substantial portion of our products and pipeline, may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. \nGlobally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator biologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, as well as in Europe and Japan. Regulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve, and therefore the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty. For example, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing.\nBiosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. While competitors have developed biosimilars that compete with our products, we have developed our own biosimilar and may develop others in the future. \nCompounding\nIn recent periods, we have seen an increase in the production, marketing, and sale of counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded incretins. These practices may impact patient safety, undermine regulatory drug approval processes, and present market risks. If inadequately regulated, these practices could materially impact our business and reputation, including by creating consumer confusion or misperceptions about the safety and efficacy of our genuine products, diversion of potential sales, and potential net price erosion for our products. See Item 1, \"Business—Government Regulation of Our Operations and Products,\" for additional information on market risks related to counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded medicines.\nU.S. Private Sector Dynamics\nIn the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, pharmacies, and other supply chain entities have consolidated into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their market power and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounts or rebates in exchange for formulary inclusion and placement.\nFormulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a product for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels, and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in negotiations, and compete fiercely for formulary placement, not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates or other concessions. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and rebates, value-based agreements, where rebates may be based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another increasingly prevalent tool. Rebates and net cost are increasingly important factors in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These pressures have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans, higher co-insurance, or co-pays, including increased utilization of co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs. Supply chain entities have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see \"—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access—U.S.\"\n9\nPatents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights\nOverview\nIntellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines and uses. Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product, often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.\nThe patent protection generally anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent) for our products, particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. In general, patents in each relevant country last for a period of 20 years from their filing date, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:\n•\nPatent term adjustment is available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n•\nPatent term restoration for a single patent for a pharmaceutical product is provided to U.S. patent holders to compensate for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review process. There is a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from initial FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to five years.\nIn some cases, the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\n•\nData package protection generally prohibits regulatory approval of other manufacturers' applications for marketing approval if they rely on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject to certain conditions), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan, which can be extended to 10 years with qualifying pediatric studies. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents. Legislative bodies in the European Union (EU) are discussing proposed reductions in data protection periods but it remains uncertain if, or when, these proposals might be adopted.\n•\nIn the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusivity\" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection, orphan drug exclusivity and, for products other than biologics, pediatric exclusivity is also added to the term of any relevant and non-expired patents.\n•\nA specific use of a drug or biologic can receive \"orphan\" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Orphan designation entitles a particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, which runs in parallel with any applicable patents.\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals vary widely. International and U.S. free trade agreements like the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) administered by the World Trade Organization provide global protection of certain intellectual property rights. But in a number of markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Further, many developing countries, and some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the TRIPs Agreement. \n10\nOur Intellectual Property Portfolio\nWe consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations to be important to our business. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that provide protection beyond the estimated dates shown below. For approved products, estimated dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions. Where granted, estimated dates for approved products also reflect pediatric or orphan drug exclusivity. The length of market exclusivity for our products can be difficult to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and the inherent uncertainties regarding patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will maintain market exclusivity for the duration of the estimated expiry or that exclusivity will be limited to that time frame.\nThe most relevant patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our major or recently launched patent-protected marketed products are as follows:\nTherapeutic Area\nProduct\nProtection\nTerritory\nEstimated Expiry Date\nCardiometabolic Health products\nJardiance\ncompound patent\nU.S.*\n2029\nmajor European countries\n2029\nJapan\n2030\nMounjaro/\nZepbound\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2036\nmajor European countries\n2037\nJapan\n2040\ndata protection\nU.S.\n2027\nmajor European countries\n2033\nJapan\n2030\nTrulicity\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2027\nmajor European countries\n2029\nJapan\n2029\nbiologics data protection\nU.S.\n2027\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2024\n11\nTherapeutic Area\nProduct\nProtection\nTerritory\nEstimated Expiry Date\nOncology products\nCyramza\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2026\nmajor European countries\n2028\nJapan\n2026\nbiologics data protection\nU.S.\n2026\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2024\nJaypirca\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2037\nmajor European countries\n2038\nJapan\n2040\ndata protection\nU.S.\n2028\nmajor European countries\n2033\nJapan\n2032\nRetevmo\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2037\nmajor European countries\n2037\nJapan\n2038\ndata protection\nU.S.\n2025\nmajor European countries\n2031\nJapan\n2031\nVerzenio\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2031\nmajor European countries\n2033\nJapan\n2034\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2028\nJapan\n2026\nImmunology products\nEbglyss\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2026\nmajor European countries\n2024\nJapan\n2029\nbiologics data protection\nU.S.\n2036\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2033\nJapan\n2034\nOlumiant\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2032\nmajor European countries\n2032\nJapan\n2033\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2027\nJapan\n2025\nOmvoh\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2037\nmajor European countries\n2038\nJapan\n2039\nbiologics data protection\nU.S.\n2035\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2033\nJapan\n2033\nTaltz\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2030\nmajor European countries\n2031\nJapan\n2030\nbiologics data protection\nU.S.\n2028\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2027\nJapan\n2024\n12\nTherapeutic Area\nProduct\nProtection\nTerritory\nEstimated Expiry Date\nNeuroscience products\nEmgality\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2033\nmajor European countries\n2033\nJapan\n2035\nbiologics data protection\nU.S.\n2030\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2028\nJapan\n2029\nKisunla\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2036\nJapan\n2036\nbiologics data protection\nU.S.\n2036\ndata protection\nJapan\n2032\nReyvow\ncompound patent\nU.S.\n2028\nJapan\n2028\ndata protection\nmajor European countries\n2032\nJapan\n2032\n* Jardiance and the related combination product, Glyxambi.\nThe following product candidates are the most relevant that are currently under regulatory review. Upon approval, we expect relevant compound patent and data protections to apply:\n•\nDonanemab has been submitted for regulatory review in the EU for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.\n•\nImlunestrant has been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S., the EU, and Japan for the treatment of ER-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.\nWorldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks consisting of our product names, logos, and unique product appearances that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world. Trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product.\nWe also rely in some circumstances on trade secrets and other unpatented know-how. We seek to protect our confidential information in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, corporate partners, collaborators, and vendors. These agreements may be breached, and we cannot be certain that we have adequate remedies. If our trade secrets or confidential information become known or are independently discovered by competitors, or if we enter into disputes over ownership of inventions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. \nPatent Licenses and Collaborations\nSome of our products are subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our license and collaboration agreements, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\" \nPatent Challenges \nIn the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics) when the generic manufacturer files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). \nAbsent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that the patent(s) listed in the innovator's New Drug Application (NDA) are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.\nGeneric manufacturers use this process extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition, generic companies have shown willingness to launch \"at risk,\" i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge.\n13\nUnder the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires, 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However, the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic. \nThe patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA, and the BPCIA itself, is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA, as well as by courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. In addition, there is a procedure in U.S. patent law, known as inter partes review (IPR), which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court and challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents. In recent years, U.S. government officials have proposed the exercise of \"march-in-rights\" and various other measures that, if enacted, could have a negative impact on our patent rights. We cannot predict the likelihood that these or similar proposals will be adopted, but, if adopted, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOutside the U.S., the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely. In recent years, we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the U.S.\nFor more information on patent challenges and litigation involving our intellectual property rights, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies.\" \nGovernment Regulation of Our Operations and Products\nOur operations are regulated extensively by numerous government agencies. The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation. In addition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers, pricing and reimbursement for our products, the environment, occupational health and safety, data privacy and security, and other matters. Evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations and those of other healthcare intermediaries, including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), quality assurance, and similar regulations. Regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical industry entails judgment and interpretation, which can result in varying interpretations of laws and regulations by health and other authorities. In addition, changing political leadership, including the new presidential administration and regulatory authorities in the U.S., may propose, enact, or pursue policy, regulatory, and enforcement changes that create additional uncertainty for our business. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of our current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products and uses has and will continue to require substantial effort, expense, and capital investment.\nOf particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHS), the FDA exercises jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, promotion, advertising, dissemination of information, and post-marketing surveillance of those products and devices. The FDA holds broad discretion under the FDCA to interpret the conditions and evidence necessary for timely approval of and ability to market our drugs and devices as well as those of our competitors. The centrality to our business of the FDA and corresponding international regulators exposes us to risks of oversight, administrative, and enforcement changes, delays, inconsistencies, lapses, or failures, including as may derive from insufficient staffing levels, expertise, or resources.\n14\nFollowing approval, our products must meet, and must continue to comply with, regulation by various government and regulatory agencies in connection with labeling, import, export, sale, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell and comply with notification requirements related to safety and efficacy, product supply, and other aspects of our products and operations. The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market, including as may be identified through market surveillance or third-party studies involving our products. The FDA may also mandate labeling changes, post-marketing studies, or risk management programs to products at any point in a product's life cycle based on new safety information or as part of a labeling change to a particular class of products. In addition, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products to prescribers and patients. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. \nOutside the U.S., our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the EMA in Europe, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan, and the National Medical Products Administration in China. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Regulatory and compliance requirements, as well as approval processes outside the U.S., differ from those in the U.S. and may involve additional costs, uncertainties, and risks.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. extensively regulate all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under their cGMP regulations. Regulators assess compliance with these regulations by inspecting the equipment, facilities, laboratories, and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of our products prior to marketing approval with periodic reinspection thereafter; this may include inspection of our third-party business partners. We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing, product development, and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Nonetheless, manufacturing quality and other aspects of pharmaceutical regulatory compliance is heavily scrutinized and results in government investigations, regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals, line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of any issues, any of which have and could in the future adversely affect our business and reputation. Certain of our products, devices and components are manufactured by third parties, and their failure to comply with these regulations has and could in the future adversely affect us, including through failure to supply product to us or delays in approvals of new products or indications. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business and reputation. For more information on product regulation challenges, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.\"\nWe rely on the FDA and other regulatory bodies for appropriate oversight, administration, and enforcement of our industry, anyone marketing or purporting to market medicines, and public health. We have seen an increase in the production, marketing, and sale of counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded incretins. In the U.S., these activities include mass compounding based on asserted reliance on regulatory exceptions that permit limited compounding in certain circumstances by certain entities. In contrast to the strict regulation of our facilities and manufacturing practices, these actors have experienced low barriers to entry and a lack of regulatory oversight and enforcement. These practices may impact patient safety and undermine regulatory drug approval processes. If inadequately regulated, these practices could materially impact our business and reputation, including by creating consumer confusion or misperceptions about the safety and efficacy of our genuine products, diversion of potential sales and potential net price erosion for our products.\nOther Laws and Regulations\nThe marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws, as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations, including the federal anti-kickback statute, the False Claims Act, antitrust laws, and state laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade practices, and consumer protection. These laws are administered by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, and state attorneys general. State, federal, and foreign governments, agencies, and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight, enforcement activities, and coordination with \n15\nrespect to pharmaceutical companies, which has resulted in intensified scrutiny, litigation costs, corporate criminal sanctions, and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry. \nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities, including U.S. publicly traded companies, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with officials outside the U.S. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals may be employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. \nVarious other jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. \nWe are, and could in the future become, subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages), criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position in any given period.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may affect our research, development, or production efforts. \nRegulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access \nU.S.\nThere continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, U.S. government actions to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, affects payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products. \nIn 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the HHS to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approval or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product’s best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negative impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices effective in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Given our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to expiry of exclusivities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. \nOther IRA provisions require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025 the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program (CGDP) with the new Manufacturer Discount Program (MDP). The 70 percent CGDP discount was replaced by a 10 percent MDP discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20 percent MDP discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold under the new Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant.\n16\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The IRA can cause changes to development approach and timing and investments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\nHeightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products and the practices of pharmacy benefit managers and other supply chain entities has also resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, require advance notice of list price increases, establish upper payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards, allow the importation of drugs from other countries, address pharmacy benefit manager practices, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Pharmacy benefit manager reform could be pursued or enacted in 2025. Restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. executive branch and regulatory authorities worldwide, could intensify these efforts and adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\nIn the U.S., we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs, including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (a minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases above the consumer price index over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of healthcare facilities intended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B covered entities). Additionally, an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs, such as Medicare Part B and Part D, and Medicaid. \nChanges to the 340B program or the Medicaid programs could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, continued expansion of the 340B program and growth of entities claiming entitlement to 340B pricing, including in ways that may be inconsistent with the statutory scheme, impacts our revenue on an increasing percentage of sales. Changes to the calculation of rebates under the Medicaid program could also increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and decrease the prices charged to 340B covered entities.\nWe have implemented a Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System applicable to sales through the 340B program, which generally limits distribution of 340B-priced product to: (i) covered entities and their child sites; or (ii) if a covered entity lacks an in-house outpatient pharmacy, a single contract pharmacy designated by a covered entity to establish a 340B bill to/ship to arrangement. Claims-level data is ordinarily required for any contract pharmacy. Our Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System contains certain exceptions that permit broader contract pharmacy usage, including for \"penny priced\" insulin products, provided that the covered entity passes through all discounts to eligible patients at the point of sale and meets other conditions. We believe our Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System complies with the 340B statute, but it remains subject to ongoing inquiries and litigation that could have a material impact on our business, as discussed in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies.\" Other aspects of the 340B program, including the manner in which manufacturers can offer 340B pricing, and proper definitions of \"patient\" and \"child site\" under the 340B statute, are also subject to ongoing litigation by Lilly and/or other parties, the resolution of which could impact the growth and scope of the 340B program. For example, on November 14, 2024, Lilly sued the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) over its purported rejection of Lilly’s plan to implement a cash replenishment model to make 340B pricing available to 340B covered entities, in place of the current product replenishment model.\nRebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class. \nFor a discussion of risks related to how we price our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are party to litigation and investigations related to our products, how we price or commercialize our products, and other aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our business, and we are self-insured for such matters.\"\n17\nOutside the U.S.\nGlobally, public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value, including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition, third-party organizations, including professional associations, academic institutions, and non-profit entities associated with payers, conduct and publish comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines, the impact of which can influence pharmaceutical access and pricing. \nIn most international markets, we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs, which may include price controls, international reference pricing, discounts and rebates, therapeutic reference pricing (to other, often generic, pharmaceutical choices), health technology assessments, regulatory hurdles, restrictions on physician prescription levels, and mandatory generic substitution. In these markets, healthcare services and the determination of pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products are impacted by government control at the point of care or as the primary payer.\nThe European Commission published its draft General Pharmaceutical Legislation in April 2023. While certain elements in the European Commission draft could expedite regulatory timelines, we anticipate that the overall market and patient impact would be negative if the legislation is approved as drafted. Implementation timing is unknown at this time. Health care cost containment remains a focus in the EU, among other jurisdictions. Most countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in some form of reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined internal or external markets for published prices of a product or national class of drugs. Member states also have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and may condition access on agreement of a reimbursement price or completion of cost-effectiveness or other gating studies. \nIn Japan, our products can be subject to government-mandated annual price reductions. The government may also order re-pricings for specific products or classes of products if certain criteria are met, including exceeding product use thresholds.\nChina has introduced and implemented reforms to accelerate access to innovative products and reduce costs. To drive patient access, we seek inclusion of many of our branded products on China's National Reimbursement Drug List, a list of drugs fully or partially reimbursed by China’s national basic health insurance. In exchange for broad access, these products are generally subject to negotiation of significant price concessions. China also utilizes a value-based procurement program process for products that have generic substitutes. As a general matter, products that we choose to tender through this process are similarly subject to price reductions. Our business in China may be significantly impacted by the country's evolving pharmaceutical regulatory environment, including access, intellectual property protection, regulatory enforcement and compliance, and trade policies.\nGovernments in many emerging markets are also focused on limiting health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property. Reforms in our product markets, including those that may stem from periods of uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence, or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or government budgeting priorities, may continue to result in added pressure on pricing, access, and reimbursement for our products.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by current or potential future legislative, regulatory, or payer developments. However, in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing, resulting in additional state, federal, and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing, access, and reimbursement for our products as well as overall operations.\nSee Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments,\" for additional information regarding recent legislative, administrative, and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results.\nResearch and Development\nOur commitment to research and development dates back nearly 150 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2024, we employed approximately 11,000 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities, including a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel. \n18\nOur internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of immunology, metabolism (including diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular), neuroscience, and oncology. In addition to discovering and developing new medicines, we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses, formulations, and therapeutic approaches, including complementary delivery devices or diagnostic tools, that can provide additional value to patients.\nTo supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including, among others, licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments.\nPharmaceutical development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. In addition, novel modalities can present more challenging or lengthy development timelines. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:\nPhases of New Drug Development\n•\nDiscovery Phase\nIn the discovery phase, scientists identify, design, and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets considered to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that are expected to have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development, which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.\n•\nEarly Development Phase\nEarly development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals, as necessary. In general, the first human tests (often referred to as Phase 1) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently, larger populations of patients are studied (Phase 2) to identify signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel, scientists work to identify safe, effective, and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies may continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early development phase, only a fraction move to the late development phase. The early development phase varies but can take several years to complete.\n•\nLate Development Phase\nLate phase development projects (typically Phase 3) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies. As a result, these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the candidate in treating the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies, placebo, or both. Phase 3 studies are generally conducted globally, are costly, and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval. The duration of Phase 3 testing varies by disease and may take years.\n•\nSubmission Phase\nOnce a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies, the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years, depending on the disease state, the strength and complexity of available data, the degree of unmet need, and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission, which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval, or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas.\nSee Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Clinical Development Pipeline,\" for more details about our current product pipeline.\n19\nRaw Materials and Product Supply\nMost of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, certain materials are procured from a single source. We seek to maintain sufficient inventory to provide reliability of production and manage unforeseen supply variability. However, various developments have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources, implement alternative processes, bring new manufacturing facilities online, or pause or discontinue product sales in one or more markets.\nOur active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations, including formulation, filling, assembling, delivery device manufacturing, and packaging, take place at sites in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, Ireland and a number of other sites throughout the world. To support anticipated demand for our current and prospective products, we have undertaken significant manufacturing expansion initiatives. Investments to increase our manufacturing capacity include sites in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ireland, Germany, and two in Indiana. We also utilize and are expanding arrangements with third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing, filling, finishing operations, and for device or component production and assembly. Among these third parties, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend on China-based suppliers for portions of our supply chain. U.S. federal lawmakers are considering legislation that is intended to limit supply chain reliance on China, including the proposed BIOSECURE Act. In addition, historically, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have led to the imposition of tariffs, sanctions, and certain other business restrictions between the U.S. and China. In February 2025, the U.S. presidential administration imposed new tariffs on China and China responded with tariffs on select U.S. goods. If new legislation or additional trade restrictions are adopted or geopolitical tensions were to increase and disrupt our operations in, or related to, China, such disruption could significantly impact our business and results of operations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business Internationally—Uneven economic growth or downturns or international trade and other global disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results,\" for additional information.\nWe manage our supply chain (including our own facilities, contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products, we use a variety of techniques, including comprehensive quality systems, inventory management, and back-up sites.\nHowever, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity is a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, developments such as unanticipated demand, unplanned plant shutdowns, manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities, failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities in a timely manner or at all, increases in demand on a supplier, or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for and supply of our products and those of our competitors have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products, product shortages, or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one or more markets. For example, in periods of 2024, demand for our incretin medicines exceeded production. Supply and channel dynamics in some cases also contribute to variability in financial results for our products from period to period. Further, cost and wage inflation, availability of adequate capacity in global transportation, supply chain complexities, including consolidation therein, labor market issues, international tension and conflicts, uneven economic growth or downturns, an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials, and public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, have caused, and in the future may cause, delays or disruptions in and/or increased costs related to distribution of our medicines, the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements, as well as other general business impacts. For more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties, disruptions, and shortages in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Manufacturing, quality, or supply chain difficulties, disruptions, or shortages could lead to product supply problems.\"\n20\nQuality Assurance\nOur success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality requires a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing, facilities planning, manufacturing, distribution, and dissemination of information about our medicines. \nQuality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients, equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards. Additional testing for stability over the life of the product is also performed. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or a combination thereof. Additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at third-party suppliers.\nExecutive Officers of the Company\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers.\nThe term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors, to be held on May 5, 2025 in connection with the company's annual meeting of shareholders, or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer has a \"family relationship\" with any other director or executive officer of the company, as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Certain statements in this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" may cause our actual results, financial position, and cash generated from operations to differ from these forward-looking statements.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nThis section provides an overview of our financial results, our clinical development pipeline, and other matters affecting our company and industry. \nFinancial Results\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information:\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercent Change\n2024\n2023\nRevenue\n$\n45,042.7\n \n$\n34,124.1 \n32\nNet income\n10,590.0\n \n5,240.4 \n102\nEarnings per share - diluted\n11.71\n \n5.80 \n102\nRevenue increased in 2024 driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The increase in revenue in 2024 was primarily driven by Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Verzenio, partially offset by Trulicity.\nNet income and earnings per share increased in 2024, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by increased research and development expenses, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, and asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" for additional information.\n41\nClinical Development Pipeline\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. We currently have approximately 55 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase.\nThe following select new molecular entities (NMEs) and new indication line extension (NILEX) products are currently in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review or have recently received regulatory approval in the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU), or Japan. The table reflects the status of these NMEs and NILEX products, including certain other developments, up to the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nCompound\nIndication/Study\nStatus \nDevelopments\nCardiometabolic Health\nTirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound)\nObesity\nApproved\nApproved in the U.S. and the EU in 2023 and in Japan in 2024.

There is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discovery and development. To bring a product from the discovery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies,\" for additional information.\nWe manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines and indications. A delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by pre-clinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category. \nOther Matters\nPatent Matters\nWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. \nSee Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending regarding certain of our patents.\nSee Item 1, \"Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" for a discussion of the impacts of trends involving intellectual property on our business and results.\n44\nTrends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments\nReforms, including those that may stem from political initiatives, periods of uneven economic growth or downturns, or as a result of inflation or deflation, the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or government budgeting priorities, are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\nGlobal concern over access to, and affordability of, pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action, as well as cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approval or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negative impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices effective in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Given our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to expiry of exclusivities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. \nOther IRA provisions require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant.\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The IRA can cause changes to development approach and timing and investments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities in the U.S. and worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the BIOSECURE Act, which is under consideration in the U.S. Senate. This legislation, if passed, could affect elements of the pharmaceutical supply chain; although as currently drafted we do not anticipate the bill would have a material impact on our business.\n45\nConsolidation and integration of private payers and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payer leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to the 340B program, access to insulin, pricing, product safety, and other matters that, if resolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.\nIn addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, safety signals, evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, inability to realize the benefit of capital expenditures, or delays or denials in new product approvals, line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, or other negative impacts, any of which result in reputational harm or adversely affect our business. \nSee Item 1, \"Business—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\" Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIncretin Medicines\nAt various times during 2024, demand for our incretin medicines exceeded production. Supply and channel dynamics have also contributed to variability in quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rates for tirzepatide. Tirzepatide supply currently exceeds demand in the U.S. Demand in launched markets remains dynamic, and increases or changes in demand, by dose or overall, as well as the complex supply chain, may result in periodic unavailability of certain presentations and dose levels at certain locations even when total tirzepatide supply can meet demand. Supply considerations will continue to influence the timing and approach (including available presentations) of tirzepatide launches in new markets. We continue to expand manufacturing capacity and progress efforts to bring tirzepatide to patients via different delivery presentations, such as single-use vials and multi-use pens. Production increases will continue, and additional capacity is expected to be operational over the next several years.\nWe have seen an increase in the production, marketing, and sale of counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded incretins. These practices may impact patient safety and undermine regulatory drug approval processes. Lilly will continue to consider all options, including filing lawsuits where appropriate, to address unlawful practices and the patient safety risks of unapproved, untested, and manipulated drugs.\nSee Item 1, \"Business—Government Regulation of Our Operations and Products” and Item 1A, \"Risk —Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We and our products face intense competition, including from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business,\" for additional information.\n46\nTax Matters\nWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are expected to increase their scrutiny of cross-border tax issues. Changes to existing U.S. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny by tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could have a material adverse impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nEffective January 1, 2024, several EU and non-EU countries enacted legislation (known as \"Pillar Two\") that provided for a minimum level of taxation of multinational companies. The increase to income tax expense as a result of the global minimum tax was not material in 2024 and is not expected to be material in current and future years. Our assessment of the impact for 2025 and subsequent years could be affected by legislative guidance and future enactment of additional provisions.\nAcquisitions\nWe invest in external research and technologies and manufacturing capabilities that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance or refine our pipeline and strengthen our business. \nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.\nContinued regulatory focus on business combinations in our industry, including by the Federal Trade Commission and competition authorities in Europe and other jurisdictions, could continue to delay, jeopardize, or increase the costs of our business development activities and may negatively impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. For discussion of risks related to business development activities, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.\"\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our consolidated results of operations in any given period. There is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in these rates have and could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nOther Factors\nOther factors have had, and may continue to have, an impact on our consolidated results of operations. These factors include cost and wage inflation, supply chain and labor market complexities, international tension and conflicts, uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials. \nSee Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations. \n47\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating Results—2024 \nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nPercent Change\nU.S.\n$\n30,375.2\n \n$\n21,791.0 \n39\nOutside U.S.\n14,667.5\n \n12,333.1 \n19\nRevenue\n$\n45,042.7\n \n$\n34,124.1 \n32\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\nThe following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year:\n2024 vs. 2023\nU.S.\nOutside U.S.\nConsolidated\nVolume\n31 \n%\n20 \n%\n27 \n%\nPrice\n8 \n%\n— \n%\n5 \n%\nForeign exchange rates\n— \n%\n(1)\n%\n— \n%\nPercent change\n39 \n%\n19 \n%\n32 \n%\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\nIn the U.S. the increase in volume in 2024 was primarily driven by Zepbound and Mounjaro, partially offset by Trulicity. In the U.S. the higher realized prices in 2024 were primarily driven by Humalog, Mounjaro, Verzenio, and Zepbound. \nOutside the U.S. the increase in volume in 2024 was primarily driven by Mounjaro and, to a lesser extent, Verzenio, as well as a one-time payment received of $300.0 million related to Jardiance associated with an amendment to our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. Outside the U.S. the increase in volume in 2024 was partially offset by the 2023 sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio.\n48\nThe following table summarizes our revenue, including net product revenue and collaboration and other revenue, by product in 2024 compared with 2023:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nPercent Change\nU.S.\nOutside U.S.\nTotal\nTotal\nMounjaro\n$\n8,949.9\n \n$\n2,590.2\n \n$\n11,540.1\n \n$\n5,163.1 \n124\nVerzenio\n3,420.6\n \n1,886.0\n \n5,306.6\n \n3,863.4 \n37\nTrulicity\n3,693.8\n \n1,559.7\n \n5,253.5\n \n7,132.6 \n(26)\nZepbound\n4,925.7\n \n—\n \n4,925.7\n \n175.8 \nNM\nJardiance\n(1)\n1,597.5\n \n1,743.4\n \n3,340.9\n \n2,744.7 \n22\nTaltz\n2,152.3\n \n1,108.1\n \n3,260.4\n \n2,759.6 \n18\nHumalog\n(2)\n1,502.6\n \n822.2\n \n2,324.8\n \n1,663.3 \n40\nCyramza\n442.2\n \n531.0\n \n973.3\n \n974.7 \n—\nOlumiant\n228.7\n \n728.7\n \n957.4\n \n922.6 \n4\nHumulin\n643.4\n \n273.7\n \n917.1\n \n852.1 \n8\nEmgality\n559.7\n \n310.7\n \n870.4\n \n678.3 \n28\nBasaglar\n(3)\n375.4\n \n301.5\n \n676.9\n \n728.3 \n(7)\nErbitux\n562.1\n \n65.3\n \n627.4\n \n596.5 \n5\nTyvyt\n—\n \n526.0\n \n526.0\n \n393.4 \n34\nZyprexa\n(4)\n2.0\n \n114.3\n \n116.3\n \n1,694.8 \n(93)\nBaqsimi\n2.5\n \n26.7\n \n29.1\n \n677.6 \n(96)\nOther products\n1,316.8\n \n2,080.0\n \n3,396.8\n \n3,103.3 \n9\nRevenue\n$\n30,375.2\n \n$\n14,667.5\n \n$\n45,042.7\n \n$\n34,124.1 \n32\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\nNM - not meaningful\n(1) \nJardiance revenue includes Glyxambi,\n \nSynjardy, and Trijardy XR. \n(2) \nHumalog revenue includes insulin lispro. \n(3) \nBasaglar revenue includes Rezvoglar.\n \n(4) \nZyprexa revenue includes sale of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio in 2023.\nRevenue of Mounjaro increased 85 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by strong demand and increased supply. Revenue outside of the U.S. was $2.59 billion in 2024 compared to $328.9 million in 2023, primarily driven by volume growth in launched markets. \nRevenue of Verzenio increased 36 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, wholesaler buying patterns and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 39 percent, driven by increased demand.\nRevenue of Trulicity decreased 32 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased volume primarily due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints during the first half of 2024. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 8 percent, driven by decreased volume primarily due to competitive dynamics and actions we have taken to manage demand.\nRevenue of Zepbound in the U.S. in 2024 was $4.93 billion, compared to $175.8 million in 2023. Zepbound launched in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in November 2023.\nRevenue of Jardiance remained relatively flat in the U.S. as increased demand was offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 52 percent, driven by increased volume and a one-time payment received of $300.0 million associated with an amendment to our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. Pursuant to the amendment, we and Boehringer Ingelheim adjusted commercialization responsibilities for Jardiance within certain smaller markets. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance.\nRevenue of Taltz increased 18 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts, as well as increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 19 percent, primarily driven by increased demand. \n49\nGross Margin, Costs, and Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our gross margin, costs, and expenses:\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercent Change\n2024\n2023\nGross margin\n$\n36,624.4\n \n$\n27,041.9 \n35\nGross margin as a percent of revenue\n81.3\n \n%\n79.2 \n%\nResearch and development\n$\n10,990.6\n \n$\n9,313.4 \n18\nMarketing, selling, and administrative\n8,593.8\n \n7,403.1 \n16\nAcquired in-process research and development\n3,280.4\n \n3,799.8 \n(14)\nAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges\n860.6\n \n67.7 \nNM\nOther—net, (income) expense\n218.6\n \n(96.7)\nNM\nIncome taxes\n2,090.4\n \n1,314.2 \n59\nEffective tax rate\n16.5\n \n%\n20.1 \n%\nNM - not meaningful\nGross margin as a percent of revenue in 2024 increased 2.1 percentage points compared with 2023, primarily driven by favorable product mix and higher realized prices.\nResearch and development expenses increased 18 percent in 2024, primarily driven by continued investments in our early and late-stage portfolio.\nMarketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 16 percent in 2024, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches.\nAcquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges recognized in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic. Acquired IPR&D charges recognized in 2023 primarily related to acquisitions of DICE Therapeutics, Inc., Versanis Bio, Inc., Emergence Therapeutics AG, and Mablink Biosciences SAS and from a business development transaction with Beam Therapeutics Inc. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges recognized in 2024 primarily related to a $435.0 million litigation charge and an intangible asset impairment for Vitrakvi, driven by expected commercial projections. See Notes 5 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOur effective tax rate was 16.5 percent in 2024, compared with an effective tax rate of 20.1 percent in 2023. The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 were both unfavorably impacted by non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges, with a larger impact occurring in 2023. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFor additional information for other–net, (income) expense, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Results—2023 \nFor a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2023 and 2022 see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\" in our Annual Report on \nForm 10-K\n for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n50\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include: \n•\nworking capital requirements, including related to employee payroll and benefits, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;\n•\ncapital expenditures;\n•\nshare repurchases and dividends;\n•\nrepayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings; \n•\nmilestone and royalty payments; \n•\npotential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements; and \n•\ncontributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans.\nOur management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, income tax payments, capital expenditures, dividends, milestone and royalty payments, business development activities, share repurchases and repayment of outstanding borrowings (see Notes 14, 4, 3, 13, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\nCapital expenditures were $5.06 billion during 2024, compared to $3.45 billion in 2023. We are making investments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These investments, and other capital investments that support our operations, have increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures over the next several years. \nAs we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in development, over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years. \nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $8.82 billion in 2024, compared with $4.24 billion in 2023. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.37 billion and $3.16 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe paid $3.35 billion in 2024 for acquired IPR&D primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic. We paid $947.7 million in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of a manufacturing site in Wisconsin. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2024, total debt was $33.64 billion, an increase of $8.42 billion compared with $25.23 billion at December 31, 2023. In February 2025, we issued $6.5 billion of fixed-rate notes. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the offering to fund potential business development activities, as well as general business purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n51\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a total of $8.45 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $8.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.\nDividends of $5.20 per share and $4.52 per share were paid in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The quarterly dividend was increased to $1.50 per share effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2025, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2025 of $6.00 per share.\nIn 2024, we repurchased $2.50 billion of shares, which completed our $5.00 billion share repurchase program that our board authorized in May 2021. Our board authorized a $15.00 billion share repurchase program in December 2024. No shares were repurchased under this new program as of December 31, 2024. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nSee \"—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters\" for information regarding losses of patent protection.\nBoth domestically and abroad, we monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment and international tension and conflicts; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of healthcare legislation; and various international government funding levels.\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations impact the costs of financing, investing, and operating our business. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.\nOur primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and in some cases we enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31, 2024, all of our total long-term debt is at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 5 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2024 and 2023, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.\nOur foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We in some cases enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.\nOur fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our carrying values of these investments were $1.35 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $269.9 million and $263.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n52\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. \nIndividually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\nBackground and Uncertainties\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for revenue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product revenue may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.\n53\nFinancial Statement Impact\nWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately $600 million. \nThe portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs:\n2024\n2023\nSales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year\n$\n10,667.5\n \n$\n8,214.1 \nReduction of net sales\n(1) \n41,452.3\n \n37,866.8 \nCash payments\n(41,807.0)\n(35,413.4)\nSales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year\n$\n10,312.8\n \n$\n10,667.5 \n(1) \nAdjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 2 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented.\nLitigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies\nBackground and Uncertainties\nLitigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, as applicable, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. \nWe also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance, we are predominantly self-insured for liability losses for all our currently and previously marketed products, as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.\nThe litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\n54\nAcquisitions\nBackground and Uncertainties\nTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. \nIf the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to acquired IPR&D on our consolidated statement of operations at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nThe judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue projections, and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. \nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the \"income method,\" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, probability of technical success, timing of the potential milestone event, and the discount rate.\nFinancial Statement Impact\nAs of December 31, 2024, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income taxes of $1.6 million.\n55\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets\nBackground and Uncertainties\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.\nSeveral methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of long-lived assets, all of which require multiple assumptions. When determining the fair value of indefinite-lived acquired IPR&D as well as the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment testing purposes, we utilize the \"income method,\" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFor acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in \"—Executive Overview—Clinical Development Pipeline.\" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.\nEstimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nBackground and Uncertainties\nWe file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon these interpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of many tax positions due to the complexity of tax laws. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns; however, given the uncertainty of positions that could be taken by taxing authorities during the examinations of our tax returns, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in liabilities that are greater than amounts accrued. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions, when the amount of future taxable income is unlikely to support their utilization.\nFinancial Statement Impact\nAs of December 31, 2024, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $131.3 million and $48.2 million, respectively.\n56\nRetirement Benefits Assumptions\nBackground and Uncertainties\nDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.\nAnnually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 75 percent of which are growth investments), and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.\nFinancial Statement Impact\nIf the 2024 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $15.0 million. If the 2024 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $33.2 million. If our assumption regarding the 2024 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $35.9 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 80 percent for total projected benefit obligation and 85 percent for total plan assets at December 31, 2024.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS \nInformation relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.",
