We design, develop, manufacture and sell automated test systems and robotics products. Our automated test systems are used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in many industries including consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our Robotics products include collaborative robotic arms and autonomous mobile robots (“AMRs”) used by global manufacturing, logistics and industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing and logistics costs. Our automated test equipment and robotics products and services include:\n \n\n\n•\nsemiconductor test (“Semiconductor Test”) systems; \n\n\n•\nrobotics (“Robotics”) products; and \n\n\n•\ndefense/aerospace (“Defense/Aerospace”) test instrumentation and systems, circuit-board test and inspection (“Production Board Test”) systems, and wireless test systems (referred collectively as \"All Other\").\n\n\n \n\n\nThe market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. A few customers drive significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.\n \n\n\nIn 2024, we saw strength in our Semiconductor Test business, with memory and compute offerings growing considerably compared to 2023. We expect mobile, automotive, and industrial will grow in 2025 and that recent advancements in AI inference may help mid-term recovery in these markets. Beyond AI compute, we are investing in other areas of the semiconductor test market that offer the opportunity for accelerating long-term growth, including power semi-conductors and the shift towards vertically integrated products (\"VIPs\"). We have seen the benefits start to materialize in 2024 and expect them to continue through the mid-term.\n \n\n\n2024 was a very weak industrial automation market resulting in a year-over-year decline in Robotics revenues while outperforming our peer group. In 2024, we built key OEM, systems integrators and large account strategic partnerships which will strengthen our go to market for years to come. Introduction of new products, including the MiR 1200 Pallet Jack will further expand our available markets to support our growth\n.\n\n\nOn May 27, 2024, we paid 483.1 million Euros, equivalent to $524.1 million, to purchase a combination of previously issued and outstanding shares and shares newly issued by Technoprobe, S.p.A. (\"Technoprobe\"). The shares purchased represent 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Technoprobe. We also received a board seat as part of the purchase. Additionally, as part of the transaction, we completed the sale of the Device Interface Solutions (\"DIS\") business, a component of our Semiconductor Test segment, to Technoprobe for $85.0 million in cash, net of cash and cash equivalents sold, and a customary working capital adjustment. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $57.1 million recorded as 'Gain on sale of business' in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n\nOur financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. While revenues in our test businesses are predominantly in U.S. dollars, the majority of our Robotics revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar would negatively affect Robotics revenue growth in 2025.\n \n\n\nOur corporate strategy for our test businesses is to profitably grow market share while in Robotics, we plan to profitably grow revenue through the introduction of differentiated products targeting expanding markets. Our capital allocation plan will continue to be balanced between investing in organic and inorganic growth and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n \n\n\nSupply Chain Constraints and Inflationary Pressures\n \n\n\nThe global supply shortage of electrical components, including semiconductor chips, impacted our supply chain in the first half of 2023. In the second half of 2023 and the full year of 2024, we saw improvements related to supply constraints and, consequently, did not experience material increases in our lead times and costs for components. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, inflationary pressures contributed to increased costs for product components and wage inflation, which had a minimal impact on our cost of products, gross margin and profit for the year. While our businesses could be impacted by supply constraints in the future, we do not anticipate supply chain constraints will have a material impact on our financial results in 2025.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nGovernment Regulations\n\n\nWe are subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade sanctions, trade barriers, trade embargoes, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, and other laws and regulations. Additionally, United States and foreign governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could impact our operations. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable trade regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable trade regulations for the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material, and we do not currently expect the cost of complying with existing trade laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or earnings or on our competitive position in any one year. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations or government policies, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects.\n \n\n\nFor information regarding risks associated with import-export control regulations and similar applicable laws and regulations, see Part II - Item 1A \"Risk Factors- Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n \n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \n\n\nWe have identified the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a full description of our accounting policies related to the below items refer to Note B. Accounting Policies, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\n \n\n\nCritical accounting estimates are complex and may require significant judgment by management. Changes to the underlying assumptions may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates may change, as new events occur, and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n \n\n\nIn accordance with ASC 606, “\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”)\n, we recognize revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer. Our determination of revenue requires judgment in the determination of performance obligations and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations. We often sell bundled orders that include both product and services or multiple different products within the same order. We evaluate each of the deliverables to determine if it meets the definition of a performance obligation, which requires that it is capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. This determination is based on an assessment of contractual rights of the contract and the ability of the performance obligation to perform on its own or with readily available resources. In bundled transactions we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including standalone transactions, market information and other observable inputs.\n \n\n\nEquity Method Investments\n \n\n\nWe account for investments using the equity method of accounting when it has significant influence over the financial and operating policies, but not control, of the investee. The equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and included in the 'Equity method investment' in the consolidated balance sheet. We record our share of investee's net income or loss and other comprehensive income, and the amortization of equity method basis difference, calculated as the difference between the investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets acquired, on a 3-month lag, which is applied consistently from period to period. Our share of investee's net income and the amortization of equity method basis difference are reported in 'Equity in net earnings of affiliate' in the consolidated statement of operations. We include our share of investee's other comprehensive income and a cumulative translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We monitor on an ongoing basis its equity method investments for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in fair value below carrying value.\n\n\nInventories\n \n\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost using a standard costing system which approximates cost based on a first-in, first-out basis or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window, is written\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\ndown to estimated net realizable value. Forecasted demand information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenues. The demand forecast is based on assumptions around the product life and customer and market expectations.\n \n\n\nRetirement and Postretirement Plans\n \n\n\nWe recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. Discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future.\n \n\n\nIn developing the expected return on U.S. Qualified Pension Plan (“U.S. Plan”) assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. We believe that 4.65% was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2024. The December 31, 2024 asset allocation for our U.S. Plan was 94% invested in fixed income securities, 5% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other securities. Our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.\n \n\n\nThe discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Plan is based on the FTSE Pension Index adjusted for the U.S. Plan’s expected cash flows and was 5.45% at December 31, 2024, up from 4.75% at December 31, 2023. We estimate that in 2025 we will recognize approximately $0.1 million of pension expense for the U.S. Plan. The U.S. Plan pension expense estimate for 2025 is based on a 5.45% discount rate and a 5.05% return on assets. Future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.\n \n\n\nGoodwill, Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\n \n\n\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of December 31, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. We review intangible and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Impairment of intangible and long-lived assets would result in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. The calculated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible or long-lived asset is dependent upon discounted cash flow (“DCF”) models, discount rates, and market multiples. DCF models rely on our forecasted mid-term plans which are subjective based on customer or market conditions and can change materially. We utilize third party specialists when determining discount rates and selected market multiples. A change in any of these key assumptions could result in a reporting unit, intangible asset, or long-lived asset being impaired in a future period.\n \n\n\nConvertible Debt\n \n\n\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU 2020-06 – “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. In accordance with ASU 2020-06, we account for a convertible debt instrument as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. Unsettled shares are recorded in current debt, and there is no recognition of a debt discount, which was previously amortized to interest expense. Settled shares reduce the outstanding debt balance in an amount equal to the cash paid, but do not result in any gain or loss on extinguishment. We use the if-converted method in the diluted EPS calculation for convertible instruments.\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n \n\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Evaluating the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, “\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n” is a key judgment in the valuation of income taxes. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies.

Forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenues. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window, is written down to estimated net realizable value.\n \n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an inventory provision of $18.9 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products. Of the $18.9 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $13.6 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $2.3 million was related to Robotics, and $3.1 million was related to All Other.\n \n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an inventory provision of $28.4 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products.

awards.\n\n\nThe increase in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by higher tester sales for computing, ADAS, and memory applications, partially offset by lower tester sales for legacy automotive application. The decrease in income before income taxes in Robotics was primarily driven by continued weakness in the Industrial Automation market and softer sales in Universal Robots along with higher selling and administrative costs. The decrease in income before income taxes in All Other was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of Wireless Test products.\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n \n\n\nIncome tax expense for 2024 and 2023 totaled $59.5 million and $76.8 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2024 and 2023 was 9.8% and 14.6%, respectively.\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate from 2023 to 2024 is primarily attributable to a shift in the geographic distribution of income which resulted in a reduction in income in higher tax rate foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the expiration of statute and a decrease in non-deductible officer’s compensation. These decreases in expense were partially offset by reductions in benefits from foreign tax credits, U.S research and development credits and the U.S. foreign derived intangible income deduction.\n \n\n\nWe qualify for a tax holiday in Singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met. The tax savings attributable to the Singapore tax holiday for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $17.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share and $1.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share, respectively. In November 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board which extended our Singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. The new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025.\n \n\n\nCapital Resources and Material Cash Requirements\n \n\n\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased by $213.4 million in 2024 to $723.8 million. Cash decreased due to investments in businesses for $532.1 million, stock repurchases in the amount of $198.6 million, and quarterly cash dividend payments in the amount of $76.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of business and cash generated by our global operations.\n \n\n\nOperating activities during 2024 provided cash of $672.2 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $23.9 million. This was due to a $75.5 million decrease in operating assets and a $51.6 million decrease in operating liabilities.\n \n\n\nThe decrease in operating assets was primarily due to a decrease in other assets and inventory of $119.5 million and $8.7 million respectively, partially offset by a $52.7 million increase in accounts receivable, driven by higher sales at year-end.\n \n\n\nThe decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $48.2 million decrease in accounts payable, a $6.2 million decrease in other accrued compensation, $5.8 million of retirement plan contributions, and a $3.6 million decrease in income taxes, partially offset by a $12.2 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advance payments.\n\n\nInvesting activities during 2024 used cash of $622.3 million, comprised of $532.1 million used for investments in businesses, $198.1 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, and $45.8 million used for purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by $90.3 million in proceeds from the sale of a business, $38.4 million and $24.0 million in proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities, respectively, and $0.9 million in proceeds from life insurance.\n \n\n\nFinancing activities during 2024 used cash of $251.8 million, due to $198.6 million used for the repurchase of 1.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $114.63 per share, $76.4 million used for dividend payments, and $14.1 million used for payments related to net settlement of employee stock compensation awards, partially offset by $37.3 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans.\n \n\n\nOperating activities during 2023 provided cash of $585.2 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $9.6 million. This was due to a $33.2 million decrease in operating assets and a $42.8 million decrease in operating liabilities.\n \n\n\nThe decrease in operating assets was due to a $71.0 million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales and a $5.3 million decrease in inventories, partially offset by a $43.1 million increase in prepayments and other assets due to prepayments to our contract manufacturers.\n \n\n\nThe decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $57.2 million decrease in deferred revenue and customer advance payments, a $26.9 million decrease in income taxes, a $21.2 million decrease in accrued employee compensation, and $5.5 million of retirement plan contributions, partially offset by a $45.0 million increase in accounts payable, and a $23.0 million increase in other accrued liabilities.\n \n\n\nInvesting activities during 2023 used cash of $179.6 million, due to $161.9 million used for purchases of marketable securities, $159.6 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, and $5.0 million used for issuance of convertible loans, partially offset by $85.0 million and $61.4 million in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, respectively, and $0.5 million in proceeds from the cancellation of Teradyne owned life insurance policies related to the cash surrender value.\n \n\n\nFinancing activities during 2023 used cash of $501.9 million, due to $397.2 million used for the repurchase of 3.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $102.47 per share, $67.9 million used for dividend payments, $50.3 million used for the\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\npayments of convertible debt principal, and $20.8 million used for payments related to net settlement of employee stock compensation awards, partially offset by $34.3 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans.\n \n\n\nIn January 2024, May 2024, August 2024 and November 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. Total dividend payments in 2024 were $76.4 million. In January 2023, May 2023, August 2023 and November 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share. Total dividend payments in 2023 were $67.9 million.\n \n\n\nIn January 2023, our Board of Directors cancelled the 2021 repurchase program and approved a new repurchase program for up to $2.0 billion of common stock. In 2024, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $198.6 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of $114.63 per share. In 2023, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of common stock for $397.2 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of $102.47 per share against the 2023 repurchase program. The cumulative repurchases as of December 31, 2024, under the 2023 repurchase program, were 5.6 million shares of common stock for $595.2 million, exclusive of tax,  at an average price per share of $106.21. In 2025, we intend to repurchase up to $400.0 million.\n\n\nWhile we declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. Future cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, which will consider, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.\n \n\n\nOn May 27, 2024, we paid 483.1 million Euros, equivalent to $524.1 million, to purchase a combination of previously issued and outstanding shares and shares newly issued by Technoprobe, S.p.A. (\"Technoprobe\"). The shares purchased represent 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Technoprobe. We also received a board seat as part of the purchase. Additionally, as part of the transaction, we completed the sale of the Device Interface Solutions (\"DIS\") business, a component of the Semiconductor Test segment, to Technoprobe for $85.0 million in cash, net of cash and cash equivalents sold, and a customary working capital adjustment. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $57.1 million recorded as 'Gain on sale of business' in the consolidated statement of operations.\n \n\n\nOn May 1, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of $400 million. On December 10, 2021, the credit agreement was amended to extend the senior secured revolving credit facility to December 10, 2026. On October 5, 2022, the credit agreement was amended to increase the amount of the credit facility to $750.0 million from $400.0 million. On November 7, 2023, the Credit Agreement was amended to allow for the purchase of the shares of Technoprobe. On May 16, 2024, we borrowed $185.0 million under the credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition of 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Technoprobe. We fully repaid our borrowings on the revolving credit facility prior to December 31, 2024. As of February 20, 2025, there are no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.\n \n\n\nWe expect operations to continue to be the primary source of cash to operate the business and meet material cash commitments, including any payments of convertible debt principal, our stock repurchase program, our quarterly dividends, our office lease obligations, contractual obligations related to inventory purchases and the construction of new facilities. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings.\n \n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, our future contractual obligations were related to debt, leases, retirement plan liabilities, deferred tax benefits, and purchase obligations. See Note K. “Debt”, Note J. “Leases”, Note Q. “Retirement Plans”, and Note T. “Income Taxes” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for information about those obligations, which Notes are incorporated by reference into this section. Our purchase obligations were approximately $419.8 million, with $409.6 million expected to be paid within twelve months.\n \n\n\nRetirement Plans\n \n\n\nASC 715-20, “\nCompensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans,\n” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by ASC 715-20. The pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans’ assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31.\n \n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan (“U.S. Plan”), certain qualified plans for non-U.S. subsidiaries, and a U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $0.1 million. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. Discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions related\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nto demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future.\n \n\n\nIn developing the expected return on U.S. Plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. We believe that 4.65% was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2024. The December 31, 2024 asset allocation for our U.S. Plan was 94.0% invested in fixed income securities, 5% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other securities. Our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.\n \n\n\nWe recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. We calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.\n \n\n\nThe discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Plan is based on the FTSE Pension Index adjusted for the U.S. Plan’s expected cash flows and was 5.45% at December 31, 2024, up from 4.75% at December 31, 2023. We estimate that in 2025, we will recognize approximately $0.1 million of pension expense for the U.S. Plan. The U.S. Plan pension expense estimate for 2025 is based on a 5.45% discount rate and a 5.05% return on assets. Future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our pension plans had no unrecognized pension prior service cost.\n \n\n\nThe assets of the U.S. Plan consist substantially of fixed income securities. U.S. Plan assets have decreased from $112.6 million at December 31, 2023 to $81.4 million at December 31, 2024, while the U.S. Plan’s liability decreased from $101.1 million at December 31, 2023 to $69.4 million at December 31, 2024.\n\n\nOur funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2024, we made contributions of $3.1 million to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan, and $1.0 million to certain qualified plans for non-U.S. subsidiaries. In 2025, we expect to contribute approximately $3.3 million to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan. Contributions to be made in 2025 to certain qualified plans for non-U.S. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately $1.1 million.\n \n\n\nEquity Compensation Plans\n \n\n\nIn addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note R: “Stock-Based Compensation” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have a 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the “2006 Equity Plan”) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was initially approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006.\n \n\n\nAt our annual meeting of stockholders held May 21, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 32.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 30.4 million shares issuable thereunder. At our annual meeting of stockholders held May 12, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Equity Plan to extend its term until May 12, 2025. At our annual meeting of stockholders held May 7, 2021, our stockholders approved an amendment to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 3.0 million, for an aggregate of 33.4 million shares issuable thereunder.\n \n\n\nThe following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2024 (share numbers in thousands):\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan category\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of securities\nto be issued upon\nexercise of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants and rights\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted-average\nexercise price of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants and rights\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of securities remaining\navailable for future issuance\nunder equity compensation\nplans (excluding securities\nreflected in column one)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity plans approved by shareholders\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,668\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n99.51\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,862\n\n\n \n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nIncludes 1,527,351 shares of restricted stock units that are not included in the calculation of the weighted average exercise price. \n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\n(2)\nConsists of 3,638,237 securities available for issuance under the 2006 Equity Plan and 3,224,044 of securities available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. \n\n\nThe purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to motivate employees, officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan as of December 31, 2024 was 3,638,237 shares of our common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards in the form of (1) non-qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock-based awards. Awards may be tied to time-based vesting schedules and/or performance-based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the 2006 Equity Plan. Awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of Teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as to our directors. The maximum number of shares of stock-based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units and options was $82.6 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years.\n \n\n\nPerformance Graph\n \n\n\nThe following graph compares the change in our cumulative total shareholder return in our common stock with (i) the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and (ii) the Morningstar Global Semiconductor Equipment & Materials GR USD Industry Group. The comparison assumes $100.00 was invested on December 31, 2019 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends, if any. Historic stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n \n\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2023-07, \n\"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\"\n, which requires us to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") on an annual and interim basis as well as provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, we are required to disclose the title and position of the CODM. We retrospectively adopted and complied with this standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2024. See Note U: \"Segment, Geographic and Significant Customer Information.\" The adoption of this standard had no impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 –\n“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”\n, which requires expanded disclosures relating to the tax rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and income tax expense (benefit), requiring a greater disaggregation of information for each. The provisions of ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments in this update should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard.\n \n\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03-\n\"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income -Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\"\n, which requires disclosure of additional expense information on an annual and interim basis, including the amounts of inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible amortization included within each income statement expense caption. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard.",
