BUSINESS\nGeneral Information\nFifth Third Bancorp (the “Bancorp” or “Fifth Third”), an Ohio corporation organized in 1975, is a bank holding company (“BHC”) as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and has elected to be treated as a financial holding company (“FHC”) under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”).\nThe Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio and is the indirect holding company of Fifth Third Bank, National Association (the “Bank”). As of December 31, 2024, Fifth Third had $213 billion in assets and operates 1,089 full-service Banking Centers and 2,080 Fifth Third branded ATMs in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The Bancorp operates three main businesses: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Fifth Third is among the largest money managers in the Midwest and, as of December 31, 2024, had $634 billion in assets under care, of which it managed $69 billion for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations. Investor information and press releases can be viewed on the Bancorp’s Investor Relations website at ir.53.com. Information on or accessible through our website is not deemed to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Website references in this Annual Report are merely textual references. Fifth Third’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ® Global Select Market under the symbol “FITB.”\nThe Bancorp’s subsidiaries provide a wide range of financial products and services to the commercial, financial, retail, governmental, educational, energy and healthcare sectors. This includes a variety of checking, savings and money market accounts, wealth management solutions, payments and commerce solutions, securities products and services, insurance services and credit products such as commercial loans and leases, mortgage loans, credit cards, installment loans and other lending products. These products and services are delivered through a variety of channels including the Bancorp’s banking centers, other offices, telephone sales, the internet and mobile applications. The Bank has deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”). Refer to Exhibit 21 filed as an attachment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of subsidiaries of the Bancorp as of February 15, 2025.\nAdditional information regarding the Bancorp’s businesses is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAvailability of Financial Information\nThe Bancorp files reports with the SEC. Those reports include the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and annual proxy statement, as well as any amendments to those reports. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. The Bancorp’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, annual proxy statement and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are accessible at no cost on the Bancorp’s Investor Relations website at ir.53.com on a same day basis after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nInformation about the Bancorp’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (as amended from time to time), is available on Fifth Third’s corporate website at www.53.com. In addition, any future waivers from a provision of the Fifth Third Code of Business Conduct and Ethics covering any of Fifth Third’s directors or executive officers (including Fifth Third’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller) will be posted at this internet address.\nCompetition\nThe Bancorp, primarily through the Bank, competes for deposits, loans and other banking services in its principal geographic markets as well as in selected national markets as opportunities arise. In addition to traditional banking institutions, the Bancorp competes with securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, specialty finance, private credit, financial technology and insurance companies. These companies compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers with meaningful alternatives to traditional banking services in nearly all significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology, product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. These competitive trends are likely to continue.\nHuman Capital Resources\nThe Bancorp’s human capital strategy is designed to attract, develop and retain talent. This strategy ensures that Fifth Third has the talent, capabilities and organizational structure to support business needs now and in the future. As of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp had 18,616 full-time equivalent employees, compared to 18,724 as of December 31, 2023. These employees support the organization’s ambition and purpose by upholding its values by committing to excellence, being connected and acting with creativity and courage. Fifth Third is committed to living its values, serving its customers, delivering financial performance and being recognized as a leader in building an engaging workplace.\n16 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nEngagement and Development\nFifth Third believes that an engaged workforce is one of its most valuable assets in sustaining its success. The Bancorp’s continuous listening strategy is an important component of its inclusive culture. The Bancorp’s holistic approach to collecting, measuring and responding to employee feedback enhances the employee experience at critical points during times of change in business or work environments. Feedback is collected through a variety of methods, including the Employee Viewpoints Survey, which includes questions related to culture, engagement, inclusion, employee well-being, expectations and intent to stay. \nThe Bancorp’s learning, development and career mobility strategy delivers personalized and accessible experiences that fuel career growth and help retain talent. In response to employee feedback, Fifth Third continued its focus on career mobility with enhanced tools to support internal career pathing. This includes a robust suite of learning resources covering several areas, including leadership and professional development to foster learning and career advancement across the employee population. In 2024, employees engaged in over 255,000 hours of discretionary learning.\nSeveral new initiatives were introduced, including a comprehensive onboarding program for new managers, a high performing program for senior leaders, and new offerings aimed at developing the professional and leadership skills necessary to build a strong pipeline of leaders. Fifth Third leaders engaged in 2,800 different development offerings. Fifth Third’s commitment to compliance and risk management also remains strong, with all employees and contingent workers completing more than 475,000 course hours on these topics.\nTotal Rewards – Compensation and Benefits \nThe Bancorp is committed to providing competitive compensation programs that attract and retain top talent, while driving the business strategy and effectively managing risk. Fifth Third’s compensation programs are designed to reward performance and align with regulatory expectations while reflecting the Bancorp’s values and behavioral standards. The Bancorp’s compensation philosophy is centered on creating long-term shareholder value.\nFifth Third continuously analyzes its compensation programs to ensure all employees have equal opportunities to maximize their potential. Fifth Third’s comprehensive benefits program is designed to address the personal and professional needs of employees and their families. In addition to traditional benefits offerings, the Bancorp provides comprehensive support with unique programs focused on the financial, physical, emotional and social well-being of employees.\nRecruitment and Retention\nThe Bancorp continues to navigate the changing talent landscape by monitoring the external environment and adapting talent strategies to meet internal needs. The Bancorp’s focus on its employee value proposition demonstrates a continued commitment to employees by developing great leaders and evolving the employee experience. Full year turnover improved, decreasing from 16.9% in 2023 to 16.2% in 2024.\nThe Bancorp’s recruitment strategies enhance the organization by promoting an inclusive culture. To attract the most talented employees, the Bancorp continues to enhance relationships with universities and partner organizations to attract top talent. Creating and developing an inclusive workforce is important for the Bancorp’s business growth, leading to enhanced innovation while focusing on the needs of its customers. \nAcquisitions and Investments\nThe Bancorp’s strategy for growth includes strengthening its presence in core markets, expanding its presence in high-growth markets and broadening its product offerings. In order to take into account the integration and other risks, the Bancorp conducts due diligence to evaluate and identify the risks associated with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations regarding acquisitions and investments may take place and future transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution of tangible book value and net income per share may occur with any future transactions.\n17 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nRegulation and Supervision\nIn addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of banks and their parent companies (such as the Bank and the Bancorp) by bank regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the maintenance of the federal deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or classes of consumers, rather than the protection of shareholders or debtholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to an extensive regulatory framework of complex and comprehensive federal and state laws and regulations addressing the provision of banking and other financial services and other aspects of the Bancorp’s businesses and operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) and legislation modifying Dodd-Frank, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“EGRRCPA”), will continue to impact the Bancorp and the Bank. To the extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. While the regulatory environment has recently been in a period of rebalancing, the Bancorp expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nThe EGRRCPA amended various sections of Dodd-Frank, including section 165, which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for BHCs. The EGRRCPA’s increased asset thresholds took effect immediately for BHCs with total consolidated assets less than $100 billion, with the exception of risk committee requirements, which now apply to publicly traded BHCs with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets. BHCs with consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, including the Bancorp, were subject to the enhanced prudential standards that applied to them before enactment of EGRRCPA until December 31, 2019, when rules adopted by the FRB that tailor the applicability of enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements for BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets became effective, as described in detail below.\nSubsequent to the EGRRCPA, the FRB adopted a rule that adjusts the thresholds at which certain enhanced prudential standards (“EPS”) apply to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (the “EPS Tailoring Rule”) and the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) and FDIC adopted a rule that similarly adjusts the thresholds at which certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to BHCs and banks with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (the “Capital and Liquidity Tailoring Rule” and, together with the EPS Tailoring Rule, the “Tailoring Rules”). The Tailoring Rules establish four risk-based categories of institutions, and the extent to which enhanced prudential standards and certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to these BHCs and banks depends on the banking organization’s category. Under the Tailoring Rules, the Bancorp and the Bank each qualify as a Category IV banking organization subject to the least restrictive of the requirements applicable to firms with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets.\nRegulators\nThe Bancorp and/or the Bank are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and the OCC and additionally by certain other functional regulators and self-regulatory organizations. The Bancorp is also subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of its status as a public company and due to the nature of some of its businesses. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the Bank’s deposits as permitted by law.\nThe federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks and to BHCs regulate, among other matters, the scope of the Bancorp’s and the Bank’s businesses, their activities, their investments, their capital and liquidity levels, their ability to make capital distributions (such as share repurchases and dividends), their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual and related borrowers and the nature, the amount of and collateral for certain loans and the amount of interest that may be charged on loans, as applicable. Various federal and state consumer laws and regulations also affect the services provided to consumers.\nThe Bancorp and the Bank are required to file various reports with and are subject to examination by various regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the CFPB. The FRB, the OCC and the CFPB have the authority to issue orders for BHCs and banks to cease and desist from certain banking practices and violations of conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, the FRB, the OCC and the CFPB. Some of the Bancorp’s and the Bank’s regulators are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals in certain situations, such as when there is a violation of a law or regulation. Applicable state and federal laws also grant the Bancorp’s regulators the authority to impose additional requirements and restrictions on the activities of the Bancorp and the Bank and, in some situations, the imposition of such additional requirements and restrictions will not be publicly available information.\nThe following discussion describes certain elements of the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to the Bancorp and its subsidiaries. This discussion is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to the Bancorp, the Bank and the Bancorp’s other subsidiaries.\nAcquisitions\nThe BHCA requires the prior approval of the FRB for a BHC to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, BHC or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any BHC.\n18 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nThe BHCA generally prohibits a BHC from engaging in, or acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a BHC that engages directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its banking subsidiaries, except that it may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto.\nFinancial Holding Companies\nThe Bancorp is registered as a BHC with the FRB under the BHCA and qualifies for and has elected to become an FHC. An FHC is permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a BHC under the BHCA. Permitted activities for an FHC include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. In addition, an FHC is allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the FRB. A BHC may elect to become an FHC if the BHC is well-capitalized and is well managed and each of its banking subsidiaries is well-capitalized, is well managed and has at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). To maintain FHC status, a BHC must continue to meet these requirements. The failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of the FHC and may also adversely affect the FHC’s ability to enter into certain transactions (including mergers and acquisitions) or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, as well as loss of FHC status. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of an FHC, such information may not necessarily be available to the public.\nDividends\nThe Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and depends in part upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the Bank, to fund its activities, including its ability to make capital distributions, such as paying dividends or repurchasing shares. Under federal law, there are various limitations on the extent to which the Bank can declare and pay dividends to the Bancorp, including those related to regulatory capital requirements, general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits, surplus and available earnings. Certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Bancorp. No assurances can be given that the Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to the Bancorp.\nThe Bancorp’s ability to declare and pay dividends is similarly limited by federal banking law and FRB regulations and policy. The FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay dividends unless a BHC’s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Bancorp’s ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing shares, is subject to the Bancorp complying with the automatic restrictions on capital distributions under the FRBs “Capital Rules” process discussed below (see Regulatory Capital Requirements below).\nSource of Strength\nA BHC, including the Bancorp, is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of the Bancorp or its shareholders or creditors. United States (“U.S.”) banking regulators may require a BHC to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the BHC with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the BHC fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the FRB believes might jeopardize the BHC’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank.\nUnder these requirements, the Bancorp may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress. Capital loans by the Bancorp to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the Bank. In the event of the Bancorp’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Bancorp to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nFDIC Assessments\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor per account ownership category per bank and is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions, based on the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The Bank accepts customer deposits that are insured by the DIF and, therefore, must pay insurance premiums. The FDIC may increase the Bank’s insurance premiums based on various factors, including the FDIC’s assessment of its risk profile.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30%, below the statutory minimum of 1.35%. The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amended restoration plan to increase the likelihood that the reserve \n19 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nratio would be restored to at least 1.35% by September 30, 2028. The FDIC’s amended restoration plan increases the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, which began with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. \nIn response to the bank failures that occurred in the first half of 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule for a special deposit insurance assessment on banking organizations with greater than $5 billion in assets to recover the losses to the DIF associated with protecting uninsured depositors. As of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp’s estimate of its allocation of the special assessment was $252 million, based on the most recent information provided by the FDIC. As a result of this special assessment, the Bancorp recorded expense of $28 million and $224 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and \n2023, respectively,\n related to this estimate. The Bancorp currently expects to pay the special assessment to the FDIC over a total of ten quarterly assessment periods, which began with the first quarter of 2024. The estimate of the cost associated with protecting the uninsured depositors will continue to be subject to periodic adjustment until the final loss amount is determined by the FDIC.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nFederal banking laws restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates, including a parent BHC. The Bank is subject to these restrictions, which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place, including extensions of credit to affiliates, investments in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates. These restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank. Generally, a bank’s covered transactions with any affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. Dodd-Frank expanded the scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as the Bank, and their subsidiaries to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe CRA generally requires insured depository institutions, including the Bank, to identify the communities they serve and to make loans and investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of those communities. The CRA requires the OCC to evaluate the performance of national banks (including the Bank) with respect to these CRA obligations. Depository institutions must maintain comprehensive records of their CRA activities for purposes of these examinations. The OCC must take into account the institution’s record of performance in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. For purposes of CRA examinations, the OCC rates each institution’s compliance with the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The Bank’s most recently received CRA performance rating from the OCC was Outstanding. \nThe CRA requires the relevant federal bank regulatory agency to consider a bank’s CRA assessment when considering the bank’s application to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions or to open or relocate a branch office. The FRB also must consider the CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a BHC in connection with any acquisition or merger application filed by the BHC. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay or result in the denial of an approval or application by the Bancorp or the Bank.\nOn October 24, 2023, the OCC, FRB and FDIC issued a final rule to modernize their respective CRA regulations. The revised rules substantially alter the methodology for assessing compliance with the CRA, with material aspects taking effect January 1, 2026 and revised data reporting requirements taking effect January 1, 2027. Among other things, the revised rules evaluate lending outside traditional assessment areas generated by the growth of non-branch delivery systems, such as online and mobile banking, apply a metrics-based benchmarking approach to assessment and clarify eligible CRA activities. The revised CRA regulations have been subject to an injunction since March 29, 2024. The effective dates will be extended for each day the injunction remains in place, pending the resolution of the lawsuit.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Bancorp and the Bank are subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the capital adequacy rules (the “Capital Rules”) adopted by the FRB, for the Bancorp, and by the OCC, for the Bank. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the FRB and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Bancorp’s operations or financial condition. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bancorp’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications. Under the Capital Rules, the Bancorp’s and the Bank’s assets, exposures and certain off-balance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions’ risk-weighted assets pursuant to the federal banking agencies’ Standardized Approach to risk-weighting of assets. These risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for the Bancorp and the Bank:\n•\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital primarily includes common shareholders’ equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The Bancorp has elected to exclude certain AOCI components, with the result that those components are not recognized in the Bancorp’s CET1. The FDIC, FRB and OCC have jointly issued rules for institutions that do not apply advanced approaches to regulatory capital, including the \n20 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nBancorp and the Bank. These rules simplified the capital treatment of certain items (including mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions) and simplified the recognition and calculation of minority interests that are includable in regulatory capital. The advanced approaches to regulatory capital are generally required for large, internationally active banking organizations including those designated as global systemically important BHCs and those with total assets or cross-jurisdictional activity in excess of certain thresholds.\n•\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments.\n•\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of total capital, including CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses (“ACL”). Tier 2 capital also includes, among other things, certain trust preferred securities.\n•\nLeverage Ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets (net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions).\nUnder the Capital Rules, an institution’s eligible retained income, when considered in conjunction with capital ratios and the stress capital buffer, provides limitations on capital distributions (including dividends and share repurchases) and certain executive compensation arrangements for the quarter following the calculation. As of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp was not subject to these limitations. \nEffective January 1, 2020, the Bancorp elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of ASU 2016-13 (“CECL”) on regulatory capital. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (“modified CECL transitional amount”) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (“CECL transitional amount”) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount was then fixed as of December 31, 2021 and that amount is subject to the three-year phase out. Refer to the Capital Management section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.\nThe Capital Rules also require banking organizations to maintain a stress capital buffer to avoid becoming subject to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers (see Stress Buffer Requirements below). For more information related to the stress capital buffer, refer to Note 29 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe total minimum regulatory capital ratios and well-capitalized minimum ratios are reflected in the table below. The FRB has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for BHCs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the Capital Rules. For purposes of the FRB’s Regulation Y, including determining whether a BHC meets the requirements to be an FHC, BHCs, such as the Bancorp, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater. If the FRB were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as that applicable to the Bank, the Bancorp’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. The FRB may require BHCs, including the Bancorp, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a BHC’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.\nThe following table presents the minimum regulatory capital ratios, minimum ratio plus stress capital buffer and well-capitalized minimums compared with the Bancorp’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2024:\nRegulatory Capital Ratios:\nMinimum Regulatory Capital Ratio\nMinimum Ratio + Stress Capital Buffer\n(a)\nWell-Capitalized Minimums\n(b)\nActual at\nDecember 31, 2024\nCET1 risk-based capital ratio:\nFifth Third Bancorp\n4.50 \n%\n7.70 \nN/A\n10.57 \nFifth Third Bank, National Association\n4.50 \n7.70 \n6.50 \n12.86 \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio:\nFifth Third Bancorp\n6.00 \n9.20 \n6.00 \n11.86 \nFifth Third Bank, National Association\n6.00 \n9.20 \n8.00 \n12.86 \nTotal risk-based capital ratio:\nFifth Third Bancorp\n8.00 \n11.20 \n10.00 \n13.86 \nFifth Third Bank, National Association\n8.00 \n11.20 \n10.00 \n14.19 \nLeverage ratio:\nFifth Third Bancorp\n4.00 \nN/A\nN/A\n9.22 \nFifth Third Bank, National Association\n4.00 \nN/A\n5.00 \n10.02 \n(a)\nReflects the stress capital buffer of 3.2% as of December 31, 2024.\n(b)\nReflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Bancorp under FRB Regulation Y and the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Bank.\n21 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\nThe FRB’s capital plan rule requires BHCs with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets, including the Bancorp, to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the BHC’s business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a detailed description of the BHC’s process for assessing capital adequacy and the BHC’s capital policy.\nThe FRB annually evaluates capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment processes and capital distribution plans of BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The evaluation process is intended to help ensure that those BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company’s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress.\nIn March 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule to integrate the annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements for large BHCs. As a result, the FRB’s supervisory stress test process is now used to calibrate the stress capital buffer requirement for large BHCs. As a result of the EPS Tailoring Rule, Category IV BHCs, including the Bancorp, are no longer required to conduct and disclose the results of company-run stress tests and are subject to the supervisory stress test process every two years. The Bancorp’s most recent required assessment was completed in 2024. These supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp’s capital. \nStress Buffer Requirements\nThe Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum risk-based capital ratios and the stress capital buffer to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp’s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp’s stress capital buffer under the FRB severely adverse scenario was 3.2% as of December 31, 2024 and 2.5% as of December 31, 2023. The Bancorp’s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\nPursuant to Title I of Dodd-Frank, certain U.S. BHCs are subject to enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements. As a result, the Bancorp is subject to more stringent standards, including liquidity and capital requirements, leverage limits, stress testing, resolution planning and risk management standards, than those applicable to smaller institutions. Certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards.\nAs discussed above, under the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp, as a Category IV banking organization, is subject to the least restrictive enhanced prudential standards applicable to firms with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As compared to enhanced prudential standards that were applicable to the Bancorp, under the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp is no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements and is subject to less frequent supervisory stress tests, less frequent internal liquidity stress tests and reduced liquidity risk management requirements.\nHeightened Governance and Risk Management Standards\nThe OCC has published guidelines documenting expectations for the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions, including the Bank. The guidelines require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities. In addition, the guidelines provide standards for the institutions’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. The Bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls.\nPrivacy and Data Security\nThe OCC, FRB, FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the OCC, FRB and the SEC, have increased their focus on cybersecurity through guidance, examinations and regulations. The Bancorp has adopted an information security program that has been approved by the Bancorp’s Board of Directors. For more information related to cybersecurity, refer to Part I, Item 1C of this report.\nThe GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiary’s policies and procedures. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy.\nStates are also increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and data protection such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. The Bancorp continues to assess the requirements of such laws and proposed legislation and their applicability to the Bancorp. \n22 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMoreover, these laws, and proposed legislation, are still subject to revision or formal guidance and they may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our understanding.\nLike other lenders, the Bank and other of the Bancorp’s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the Bancorp and its subsidiaries.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions\nThe Bancorp is subject to federal laws that are designed to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, and transactions with certain persons, companies or foreign governments sanctioned by the U.S. These include the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and regulations for the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act, as administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws obligate depository institutions and broker-dealers to verify their customers’ identity, conduct customer due diligence, report on suspicious activity, file reports of transactions in currency and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts. They also prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with certain designated restricted countries and persons. Depository institutions and broker-dealers are required by their federal regulators to maintain robust policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with these obligations.\nFailure to comply with these laws or maintain an adequate compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger, acquisition, restructuring or other expansionary activity. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions by regulators, as well as state attorneys general and the Department of Justice, against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to these laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas. The Bancorp’s Board has approved policies and procedures that the Bancorp believes comply with these laws.\nDebit Card Interchange Fees\nDodd-Frank includes a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. Interchange fees for electronic debit transactions are limited to 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction, plus an additional one cent per transaction fraud adjustment. These rules impose requirements regarding routing and exclusivity of electronic debit transactions, and generally require that debit cards be usable in at least two unaffiliated networks. On October 25, 2023, the FRB proposed to lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive for a debit card transaction. The proposal would also establish a regular process for updating the maximum amount every other year going forward. Fifth Third continues to monitor the development of these proposed rule revisions.\nResolution Planning\nThe FRB and FDIC have previously required certain BHCs and banking institutions to periodically submit resolution plans discussing how a company or institution could be rapidly and orderly resolved in the event of material financial distress or failure. The Bancorp, as a BHC with less than $250 billion of assets, is no longer subject to the FRB’s resolution plan requirements. However, the Bank is still subject to resolution planning requirements enacted by the FDIC. The FDIC’s resolution planning requirements were temporarily suspended in April 2019 as the FDIC requested comments on how to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size, complexity and risk profile. In 2021, the FDIC provided implementation guidance on certain aspects of its resolution plan rule and the Bank submitted a resolution plan to the FDIC by the December 1, 2022 deadline, as required under that guidance. In June 2024, the FDIC board approved a final rule to amend its resolution plan requirements that largely apply to insured depository institutions with more than $100 billion in assets, including the Bank. This rule requires submission of comprehensive resolution plans that meet enhanced standards every three years, and interim submissions in intervening years. The final rule took effect on October 1, 2024, and the Bank’s first submission under the new requirements is due on or before July 1, 2025. \nRecovery Planning\n \nOn October 21, 2024, the OCC amended its enforceable Recovery Planning Guidelines to apply to banks with at least $100 billion in assets, such as the Bank, effective January 1, 2025, subject to a twelve-month compliance period. Broadly, the guidelines require a recovery plan that includes indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that reflect the Bank’s particular vulnerabilities, credible options the Bank could undertake in response to restore its financial strength and viability and an assessment and description of how these options would affect the Bank. Recovery plans must also address overall organizational and legal entity structure and related interconnections and interdependencies, procedures for escalating decision-making, management reports, communication procedures and any other information the OCC requires.\nRegulatory Regime for Derivatives\nTitle VII of Dodd-Frank imposes a registration regime and regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital margin, segregation trade reporting, position limits, business conduct standards and recordkeeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a swap dealer or a security-based swap dealer. The Bank is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer. The CFTC, SEC and U.S. banking regulators have finalized the rules implementing Title VII applicable to the over-the-counter derivatives markets and swap dealers. As a CFTC registered swap dealer, the Bank is subject to the requirements of Title \n23 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nVII, including rules related to internal and external business conduct standards, reporting, recordkeeping, mandatory clearing for certain swaps and trade documentation and confirmation requirements. In addition, the U.S. banking regulators have finalized regulations applicable to the Bank regarding mandatory posting, collection and segregation of margin by certain swap counterparties and capital requirements. The Bank is not registered as a security-based swap dealer.\nBroker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\nFifth Third’s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC. Financial Industry Regulation Authority (“FINRA”) is the primary self-regulatory organization for Fifth Third’s registered broker-dealer subsidiary. Fifth Third’s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions. The SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA considers a variety of factors in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\nConsumer Protection Regulation and Supervision\nThe Bancorp is subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws. The Bancorp is also subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under Dodd-Frank, state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. State authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services.\nThe CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related final rules since it was established under Dodd-Frank, including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher priced mortgages. The mortgage-related final rules issued by the CFPB have materially restructured the origination, servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the U.S. These rules have impacted, and will continue to impact, the business practices of mortgage lenders, including the Bancorp.\nFuture Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives\nFederal and state legislators as well as regulatory agencies may introduce or enact new laws and rules, or amend existing laws and rules, that may affect the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The regulatory agencies may seek to apply higher standards to the Bancorp and the Bank than as required by law, through supervision. The impact of any future legislative or regulatory changes, or supervisory direction, cannot be predicted. However, such changes could affect the Bancorp’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n24 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents",
  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp’s (the “Bancorp” or “Fifth Third”) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank.\nOVERVIEW\nThis overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&A, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.\nThe Bancorp’s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 66% and 34% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral.\nNoninterest income is derived from wealth and asset management revenue, commercial payments revenue, consumer banking revenue, capital markets fees, commercial banking revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, loan and lease expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense.\nFDIC Special Assessment\nIn response to the bank failures that occurred in the first half of 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule for a special deposit insurance assessment on banking organizations with greater than $5 billion in assets to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors. As of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp’s estimate of its allocation of the special assessment was $252 million, based on the most recent information provided by the FDIC. As a result of this special assessment, the Bancorp recorded expense of $28 million and $224 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and \n2023, respectively,\n related to this estimate. The Bancorp currently expects to pay the special assessment to the FDIC over a total of ten quarterly assessment periods, which began with the first quarter of 2024. The estimate of the cost associated with protecting the uninsured depositors will continue to be subject to periodic adjustment until the final loss amount is determined by the FDIC.\n47 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAccelerated Share Repurchase Transactions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions totaling $625 million. Refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity.\nSenior Notes Offerings\nOn January 29, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold $1.0 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on January 29, 2032. The senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.631% per annum until January 28, 2031. From January 29, 2031 until maturity, the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.840%. \nOn September 6, 2024, the Bancorp issued and sold $750 million of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on September 6, 2030. The senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.895% per annum until September 5, 2029. From September 6, 2029 until maturity, the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.486%. \nRefer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nTransfer of Securities\nIn January 2024, the Bancorp transferred $12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to reflect the Bancorp’s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for more information.\nCFPB Settlements\nOn July 9, 2024, the Bank and the CFPB agreed to resolve previously outstanding litigation which alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act. The Bank agreed to the entry of a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order, pursuant to which the Bank, without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the suit except as specified in the order, agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $15 million, agreed to maintain existing policies around its consumer sales incentives, agreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its account opening practices comply with law and the order and agreed to provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers with checking, savings, or credit card accounts opened beginning January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2016.\nConcurrently, the Bank also agreed to entry of a Consent Order related to a since-discontinued program in its auto lending business that placed collateral protection insurance on certain automobile loans. Under this Consent Order, without admitting or denying any of the findings of fact or conclusions of law (except to establish jurisdiction), the Bank agreed to pay a $5 million civil monetary penalty related to those issues, maintain existing policy changes related to its auto servicing practices, agreed to create a compliance plan to ensure its compliance with the order and provide a redress plan to remediate certain customers within a redress period beginning July 21, 2011 and ending December 31, 2020.\nRefer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these settlements.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change.\nThe following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp’s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp’s compensation programs:\n•\nCET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets\n•\nReturn on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity\n•\nReturn on Average Common Equity, Excluding AOCI (non-GAAP): Net income available to common shareholders divided by total equity, excluding AOCI and preferred stock\n•\nNet Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets\n•\nEfficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income\n•\nEarnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards\n•\nNonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO\n•\nNet Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases \n48 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nReturn on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets\n•\nLoan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits\n•\nHousehold Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts\nThe list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp’s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.\nTABLE 1:  Earnings Summary\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions, except per share data)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome Statement Data\nNet interest income (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n5,630\n \n5,827 \n5,609 \nNet interest income (FTE)\n(a)(b)\n5,654\n \n5,852 \n5,625 \nNoninterest income\n2,849\n \n2,881 \n2,766 \nTotal revenue (FTE)\n(a)(b)\n8,503\n \n8,733 \n8,391 \nProvision for credit losses\n530\n \n515 \n563 \nNoninterest expense\n5,033\n \n5,205 \n4,719 \nNet income\n2,314\n \n2,349 \n2,446 \nNet income available to common shareholders\n2,155\n \n2,212 \n2,330 \nCommon Share Data\nEarnings per share - basic\n$\n3.16\n \n3.23 \n3.38 \nEarnings per share - diluted\n3.14\n \n3.22 \n3.35 \nCash dividends declared per common share\n1.44\n \n1.36 \n1.26 \nBook value per share\n26.17\n \n25.04 \n22.26 \nMarket value per share\n42.28\n \n34.49 \n32.81 \nFinancial Ratios\nReturn on average assets\n1.09\n \n%\n1.13 \n1.18 \nReturn on average common equity\n12.5\n \n14.2 \n13.7 \nReturn on average tangible common equity\n(b)\n17.8\n \n21.3 \n19.7 \nDividend payout\n45.6\n \n42.1 \n37.3\n(a)\nAmounts presented on an FTE basis.

For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.\nEarnings Summary\nThe Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $2.2 billion, or $3.14 per diluted share, which was net of $159 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.2 billion, or $3.22 per diluted share, which was net of $137 million in preferred stock dividends.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreasing $198 million compared to the prior year. Net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in market interest rates and deposit balance migration into higher yielding products as well as a decrease in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans for the year ended December 31, 2024. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher yields on average interest-earning assets and an increase in the average balances of other short-term investments. \nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was \n2.90%\n for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to \n3.05%\n for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe provision for credit losses was $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $515 million in the prior year. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was affected by the impacts of deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast for the commercial portfolio, higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases in specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans, partially offset by the impacts of changes in consumer loan portfolio mix, improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the consumer loan portfolio and improvements in probability of default ratings on commercial loans. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.45% and 0.32% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO increased to 0.71% compared to 0.59% at December 31, 2023. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNoninterest income decreased $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income, mortgage banking net revenue and commercial banking revenue, partially offset by increases in wealth and asset management revenue and commercial payments revenue.\n49 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNoninterest expense decreased $172 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to decreases in other noninterest expense and marketing expense, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits expense, technology and communications expense and net occupancy expense.\nFor more information on net interest income, provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense, refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A.\nCapital Summary\nThe Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp’s capital ratios, as defined by the U.S. banking agencies, were: \n•\nCET1 capital ratio: 10.57%;\n•\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio: 11.86%;\n•\nTotal risk-based capital ratio: 13.86%;\n•\nLeverage ratio: 9.22%\n50 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider the Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.\nThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:\nTABLE 2:  Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Financial Measures and Ratios on an FTE basis\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet interest income (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n5,630\n \n5,827 \n5,609 \nAdd: FTE adjustment\n24\n \n25 \n16 \nNet interest income on an FTE basis (1)\n$\n5,654\n \n5,852 \n5,625 \nInterest income (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n10,426\n \n9,760 \n6,587 \nAdd: FTE adjustment\n24\n \n25 \n16 \nInterest income on an FTE basis (2)\n$\n10,450\n \n9,785 \n6,603 \nInterest expense (3)\n$\n4,796\n \n3,933 \n978 \nNoninterest income (4)\n2,849\n \n2,881 \n2,766 \nNoninterest expense (5)\n5,033\n \n5,205 \n4,719 \nAverage interest-earning assets (6)\n194,800\n \n191,743 \n186,326 \nAverage interest-bearing liabilities (7)\n146,188\n \n137,592 \n119,624 \nRatios:\nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (1) / (6)\n2.90\n \n%\n3.05 \n3.02 \nNet interest rate spread on an FTE basis ((2) / (6)) - ((3) / (7))\n2.08\n \n2.24 \n2.72 \nEfficiency ratio on an FTE basis (5) / ((1) + (4))\n59.2\n \n59.6 \n56.2 \nThe Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.\nThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:\nTABLE 3:  Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Return on Average Tangible Common Equity\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income available to common shareholders (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n2,155\n \n2,212 \n2,330 \nAdd: Intangible amortization, net of tax\n28\n \n34 \n37 \nTangible net income available to common shareholders (1)\n$\n2,183\n \n2,246 \n2,367 \nAverage Bancorp shareholders’ equity (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n19,398\n \n17,704 \n19,080 \nLess: Average preferred stock\n2,116\n \n2,116 \n2,116 \nAverage goodwill\n4,918\n \n4,918 \n4,779 \nAverage intangible assets\n107\n \n146 \n168 \nAverage tangible common equity (2)\n$\n12,257\n \n10,524 \n12,017 \nReturn on average tangible common equity (1) / (2)\n17.8\n \n%\n21.3 \n19.7 \nThe Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. \n51 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:\nTABLE 4:  Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Capital Ratios\nAs of December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nTotal Bancorp Shareholders’ Equity (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n19,645\n \n19,172 \nLess: Preferred stock\n2,116\n \n2,116 \nGoodwill\n4,918\n \n4,919 \nIntangible assets\n90\n \n125 \nAOCI\n(4,636)\n(4,487)\nTangible common equity, excluding AOCI (1)\n17,157\n \n16,499 \nAdd: Preferred stock\n2,116\n \n2,116 \nTangible equity (2)\n$\n19,273\n \n18,615 \nTotal Assets (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n212,927\n \n214,574 \nLess: Goodwill\n4,918\n \n4,919 \nIntangible assets\n90\n \n125 \nAOCI, before tax\n(5,868)\n(5,680)\nTangible assets, excluding AOCI (3)\n$\n213,787\n \n215,210 \nRatios:\nTangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets (2) / (3)\n9.02\n \n%\n8.65 \nTangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets (1) / (3)\n8.03\n \n7.67 \n    \n52 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nNote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp during 2024 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Bancorp’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp’s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, goodwill, legal contingencies and fair value measurements. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nALLL\nThe Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp’s portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorp’s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases. Contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not extended for expected extensions, renewals or modifications except in circumstances where extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the Bancorp. Accrued interest receivable on loans is presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of other assets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. The Bancorp follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status, so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner. As a result, the Bancorp has elected not to measure a reserve for accrued interest receivable as part of its ALLL. However, the Bancorp does record a reserve for the portion of accrued interest receivable that it expects to be uncollectible. For additional information on the Bancorp’s accounting policies related to nonaccrual loans and leases, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and economic conditions and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in management’s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating expected credit losses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ALLL to the Bancorp’s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp’s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for additional information.\nThe Bancorp’s methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated.\nLarger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million on nonaccrual status are individually evaluated for an ALLL. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor’s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan or lease structure (including modifications, if any) and other factors when determining the amount of the ALLL. Other factors may include the borrower’s susceptibility to risks presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp’s evaluation of the borrower’s management. Significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of these factors are most relevant in individual circumstances, and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors. When loans and leases are individually evaluated, allowances are determined based on management’s estimate of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are collateral-dependent are measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are not collateral-dependent are typically measured based on the present value of expected cash flows of the loan or lease, discounted at its effective interest rate. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans and leases are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience.\nThe Bancorp considers loans to be collateral-dependent when it becomes probable that repayment of the loan will be provided through the sale or operation of the collateral instead of from payments made by the borrower. The expected credit losses for these loans are typically estimated based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Specific allowances on individually \n53 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nevaluated consumer and residential mortgage loans are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience.\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans and leases that are not individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers prepayments and, for loans with available credit, expected utilization rates. The Bancorp’s expected credit loss models were developed based on historical credit loss experience and observations of migration patterns for various credit risk characteristics (such as internal credit risk ratings, external credit ratings or scores, delinquency status, loan-to-value trends, etc.) over time, with those observations evaluated in the context of concurrent macroeconomic conditions. The Bancorp developed its models from historical observations capturing a full economic cycle when possible.\nThe Bancorp’s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, the Bancorp considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to three years from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions. This reversion is phased in over a two-year period. The Bancorp evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period, its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances.\nThe Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL in order to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit loss models but are not fully captured within the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models. These considerations inherently require significant management judgment to determine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the ALLL estimate. These may include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers, changes in product structures or changes in economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models. Qualitative factor adjustments may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on the Bancorp’s customers. Given the diverse circumstances that necessitate the application of qualitative factors, the specific factors considered and their relative significance to the ALLL vary from period to period.\nOverall, the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into the models, as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments. The Bancorp’s forecasts of market and economic conditions and the internal risk ratings assigned to loans and leases in the commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss models that require significant management judgment. These inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting ALLL.\nRefer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the Bancorp’s ALLL sensitivity analysis.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the commitments, taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated exposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp’s ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nValuation of Servicing Rights\nWhen the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. The Bancorp may also purchase servicing rights. The Bancorp has elected to measure all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date with changes in the fair value of servicing rights reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. Servicing rights are valued using internal OAS models. Significant management judgment is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the OAS and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. In order to assist in the assessment of the fair value of servicing rights, the Bancorp obtains external valuations of the servicing rights portfolio from \n54 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nthird parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of the key assumptions utilized in the internal OAS model. For additional information on servicing rights, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nBusiness combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the recognition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. As further discussed in Note \n1\n of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Bancorp’s annual goodwill impairment test has historically been performed as of September 30 of each year. However, in 2024, the testing was performed as of September 30 and again as of October 1 to reflect the change in date in which the Bancorp will perform its annual goodwill impairment testing in future periods.\nImpairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp’s common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp’s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A recognized impairment loss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.\nThe fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp’s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorp’s stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The determination of the fair value of the Bancorp’s reporting units includes both an income-based approach and a market-based approach. The income-based approach utilizes the reporting unit’s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit’s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting unit’s forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp’s stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp’s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp’s goodwill.\nLegal Contingencies\nThe Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorp’s estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorp’s defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp’s legal proceedings.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Bancorp employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value including the market, income and cost approaches. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument’s fair value measurement. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Bancorp’s fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a \n55 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nquarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. The level of management judgment necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. Financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) require minimal judgment. The valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgment to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions including reducing liquidity in the capital markets and the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. Table 5 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts of financial instruments valued using Level 3 inputs.\nTABLE 5:  Fair Value Summary\nAs of ($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nBalance\nLevel 3\nBalance\nLevel 3\nAssets carried at fair value\n$\n45,153\n \n1,814\n \n56,073 \n1,859 \nAs a percent of total assets\n21\n \n%\n1\n \n26 \n1 \nLiabilities carried at fair value\n$\n3,114\n \n175\n \n3,106 \n174 \nAs a percent of total liabilities\n2\n \n%\n—\n \n2 \n— \nRefer to Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fair value measurements including a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant financial instruments.\n56 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSTATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS\nThe Bancorp’s Consolidated Statements of Income are presented in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following analysis focuses on a comparison of results for the year ended December 31, 2024 with the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to the Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2022. \nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding (including CDs over $250,000, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders’ equity.\nTables 6 and 7 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreasing $198 million compared to the prior year. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by lower average loan balances as a result of actions taken in 2023 to reduce lower returning facilities as well as decreased demand. Additionally, funding costs remained elevated as higher average market rates continued to drive deposit balance migration into higher yielding products. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher yields on average interest-earning assets and an increase in the average balances of other short-term investments.\nNet interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.08% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2.24% during the year ended December 31, 2023. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 42 bps, partially offset by a 26 bps increase in yields on average interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.90% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 3.05% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily impacted by the previously mentioned impacts of higher market interest rates, migration of average balances of deposits from demand deposits to interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in the average balances of loans and leases. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by elevated balances of other short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \nNet interest margin results are expected to modestly increase over the next several quarters driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and moderating deposit costs. However, net interest margin may be negatively impacted by increased deposit competition or higher levels of cash and other short-term investments. \nInterest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $142 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in yields on loans and leases, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans. For more information on the Bancorp’s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $523 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the average balances of other short-term investments and higher yields on average taxable securities driven by fixed-rate asset repricing.\nInterest expense on average core deposits increased $852 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 287 bps for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 238 bps for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of a mix shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing deposit products, higher short-term interest rates and an increase in the average balances of interest-bearing core deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorp’s deposits.\nInterest expense on average wholesale funding increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in the average balances of and yields on long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of FHLB advances.

The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.\nThe provision for credit losses was $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $515 million in the prior year. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was affected by the impacts of deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast for the commercial portfolio, higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases in specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans, partially offset by the impacts of changes in consumer loan portfolio mix, improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the consumer loan portfolio and improvements in probability of default ratings on commercial loans. \nThe ALLL increased $30 million from December 31, 2023 to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.96%, compared to 1.98% at December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments \n59 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ndecreased $32 million from December 31, 2023 to $134 million at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 2.08%, compared to 2.12% at December 31, 2023.\nRefer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income decreased $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table presents the components of noninterest income:\nTABLE 8:  Components of Noninterest Income\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n(a)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWealth and asset management revenue\n$\n647\n \n581 \n570 \nCommercial payments revenue\n608\n \n564 \n568 \nConsumer banking revenue\n555\n \n546 \n542 \nCapital markets fees\n424\n \n422 \n387 \nCommercial banking revenue\n377\n \n409 \n419 \nMortgage banking net revenue\n211\n \n250 \n215 \nOther noninterest income\n12\n \n91 \n149 \nSecurities gains (losses), net\n15\n \n18 \n(84)\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n2,849\n \n2,881 \n2,766 \n(a)\nDuring 2024, certain noninterest income line items were reclassified to better align disclosures to business activities. These reclassifications were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented. Total noninterest income did not change as a result of these reclassifications.\nWealth and asset management revenue increased $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in personal asset management revenue and brokerage income. The Bancorp’s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $634 billion and $574 billion in total assets under care as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and managed $69 billion and $59 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCommercial payments revenue increased $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in treasury management fees due to new client acquisition and higher average revenue per existing customer.\nConsumer banking revenue increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in interchange income associated with higher transaction volumes.\nCapital markets fees increased $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in corporate bond fees and loan syndication revenue, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from commercial customer derivatives.\nCommercial banking revenue decreased $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in operating lease income.\nMortgage banking net revenue decreased $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue:\nTABLE 9:  Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOrigination fees and gains on loan sales\n$\n67\n \n79 \n91 \nNet mortgage servicing revenue:\nGross mortgage servicing fees\n309\n \n319 \n310 \nNet valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs\n(165)\n(148)\n(186)\nNet mortgage servicing revenue\n144\n \n171 \n124 \nTotal mortgage banking net revenue\n$\n211\n \n250 \n215 \nOrigination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by the impact of gains recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 from sales of forbearance loans that were repurchased from GNMA and a decline in revenue margins due to the competitive environment.

The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included increases of $74 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates decreased during the year ended December 31, 2024 which caused an increase in prepayment speeds. The fair value of the MSR portfolio also decreased $151 million and $148 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFurther detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. Net gains and losses on these securities were immaterial during both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and were a net loss of $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Bancorp’s total residential mortgage loans serviced at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $110.9 billion and $117.0 billion, respectively, with $94.2 billion and $100.8 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others.\nThe following table presents the components of other noninterest income:\nTABLE 11:  Components of Other Noninterest Income\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBOLI income\n$\n66\n \n61 \n64 \nPrivate equity investment income\n35\n \n44 \n70 \nEquity method investment income\n18\n \n52 \n22 \nIncome from the TRA associated with Worldpay, Inc.\n11\n \n22 \n46 \nGains (losses) on sales of businesses\n7\n \n— \n(7)\nLoss on swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.

The tax credits are primarily associated with the Research Credit under Section 41 of the IRC, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. \nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were primarily impacted by $248 million and $230 million, respectively, of tax credits and other tax benefits from CDC investments, which were partially offset by $200 million for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of proportional amortization related to qualifying investments. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were also impacted by $27 million and $25 million, respectively, of tax benefits from tax exempt income. For additional information on income taxes, refer to Note \n21\n of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n63 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW\nThe Bancorp has three reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each segment is included in Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp’s segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices, which are specific to the Bancorp. Therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp’s segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management’s accounting practices and businesses change.\nThe Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third’s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. \nThe Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets increased since December 31, 2023 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products decreased modestly since December 31, 2023 due to modified assumptions and decreasing short-term rates. As a result, net interest income for each segment was negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of these updates to FTP charge and credit rates.\nThe Bancorp’s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses, which are included within other noninterest expense. Additionally, the segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.\nThe following table summarizes income (loss) before income taxes on an FTE basis by segment:\nTABLE 15:  Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes (FTE) by Segment\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome Statement Data\nCommercial Banking\n$\n1,829\n \n3,169 \n2,036 \nConsumer and Small Business Banking\n2,469\n \n3,494 \n1,656 \nWealth and Asset Management\n227\n \n353 \n251 \nGeneral Corporate and Other\n(a)\n(1,585)\n(4,003)\n(834)\nIncome before income taxes (FTE)\n$\n2,940\n \n3,013 \n3,109 \n(a)\nGeneral Corporate and Other is not a reportable segment and is presented for reconciliation purposes.\n64 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCommercial Banking\nCommercial Banking offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and government and professional customers.

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net interest income on an FTE basis and an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense and an increase in noninterest income.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis decreased $1.2 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in average balances of and rates paid on interest checking deposits and money market deposits, decreases in FTP credits on deposits and a decrease in the average balances of commercial loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in yields on average commercial loans and leases. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by an increase in FTP charges on loans and leases, which was primarily attributable to higher FTP charge rates, partially offset by the impact of lower average balances.\nProvision for credit losses increased $292 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in the allocated provision for credit losses related to commercial criticized assets as well as an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 32 bp\ns for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 12 bps for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNoninterest income increased $24 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in commercial payments revenue, partially offset by a decrease in commercial banking revenue. Commercial payments revenue\n \nincreased\n $56 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in treasury management fees due to new client acquisition and higher average revenue per existing customer and commercial card and processing revenue. \nCommercial banking revenue decreased $33 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in operating lease income. \nNoninterest expense decreased $109 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in other noninterest expense. Other noninterest expense decreased $105 million from the year ended December 31, 2023\n primarily as a result of a decrease in allocated expenses, lower leasing business expense and a decrease in losses and adjustments.\n \n65 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAverage commercial loans and leases decreased $5.0 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 driven by\n a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans, which was \nprimarily attributable to a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023 and lower demand throughout 2024.\n \nAverage deposits increased $3.3 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average demand deposits. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have generally migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-bearing products. This migration contributed to increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of $7.9 billion and $477 million, respectively, along with a decrease in average demand deposits of $5.0 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023. \n \nConsumer and Small Business Banking\nConsumer and Small Business Banking provides a full range of deposit and loan products to individuals and small businesses through a network of full-service banking centers and relationships with indirect and correspondent loan originators in addition to providing products designed to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services. Consumer and Small Business Banking includes the Bancorp’s residential mortgage, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards, automobile and other indirect lending, solar energy installation and other consumer lending activities. Residential mortgage activities include the origination, retention and servicing of residential mortgage loans, sales and securitizations of those loans and all associated hedging activities.

Solar energy installation loans and certain other consumer loans are originated through a network of contractors and installers.\nThe following table contains selected financial data for the Consumer and Small Business Banking segment:\nTABLE 17: Consumer and Small Business Banking\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome Statement Data\nNet interest income\n$\n4,169\n \n5,207 \n3,131 \nProvision for credit losses\n322\n \n303 \n139 \nNoninterest income:\n    \nConsumer banking revenue\n551\n \n544 \n538 \nWealth and asset management revenue\n247\n \n216 \n204 \nMortgage banking net revenue\n210\n \n250 \n214 \nCommercial payments revenue\n76\n \n85 \n89 \nOther noninterest income\n10\n \n10 \n8 \nNoninterest expense:\nCompensation and benefits\n882\n \n878 \n828 \nNet occupancy and equipment expense\n263\n \n253 \n234 \nLoan and lease expense\n80\n \n86 \n107 \nCard and processing expense\n75\n \n76 \n72 \nOther noninterest expense\n1,172\n \n1,222 \n1,148 \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n2,469\n \n3,494 \n1,656 \nAverage Balance Sheet Data\nConsumer loans, including held for sale\n$\n42,783\n \n42,933 \n43,049 \nCommercial loans\n3,454\n \n2,829 \n1,727 \nDemand deposits\n21,085\n \n21,891 \n23,600 \nInterest checking deposits\n10,872\n \n12,325 \n15,191 \nSavings deposits\n14,431\n \n17,017 \n20,288 \nMoney market deposits\n30,127\n \n25,288 \n22,766 \nCertificates of deposit\n11,241\n \n8,809 \n2,543 \n \nIncome before income taxes was $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in net interest income, an increase in provision for credit losses and a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense.\nNet interest income decreased $1.0 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 \nprimarily due to a decrease in FTP credits on deposits, increases in rates paid on and average balances of interest-bearing deposits and an increase in FTP charges on loans. These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in yields on loans.\nProvision for credit losses increased $19 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 \nprimarily due to an increase in the allocated provision for credit losses related to commercial criticized assets as well as increases in net charge-offs on solar energy installation loans and \n66 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nindirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. \nNet charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 68 bps for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNoninterest income decreased $11 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by an increase in wealth and asset management revenue. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the fluctuations in mortgage banking net revenue. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $31 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in brokerage income and personal asset management revenue.\nNoninterest expense decreased $43 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in net occupancy and equipment expense. Other noninterest expense decreased $50 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in allocated expenses. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $10 million \nfrom the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023 primarily driven by the Bancorp’s expansion into the Southeast markets.\nAverage consumer loans decreased $150 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by an increase in average solar energy installation loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023 and a decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average other consumer loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022. Average indirect secured consumer loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023, partially offset by increased loan production during 2024. Average solar energy installation loans increased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased loan originations. Average commercial loans increased $625 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by loan originations exceeding payoffs.\nAverage deposits increased $2.4 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 driven by increases in average money market deposits and average CDs, partially offset by decreases in average savings deposits, average interest checking deposits and average demand deposits. Average money market deposits increased $4.8 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of \nhigher average balances per customer account due to higher offering rates as well as balance migration from demand deposits, interest checking deposits and savings deposits.\n Average CDs increased $2.4 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 \nprimarily due to higher offering rates. Average savings deposits \ndecreased $2.6 billion, average interest checking deposits decreased $1.5 billion and average demand deposits decreased $806 million \nfrom the year ended December 31, 2023 \nprimarily as a result of lower average balances per customer account as well as balance migration into CDs and money market accounts.\n \n \nWealth and Asset Management\nWealth and Asset Management provides a full range of wealth management solutions for individuals, companies and not-for-profit organizations, including wealth planning, investment management, banking, insurance, trust and estate services.

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income.\nNet interest income decreased $150 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in FTP credits on deposits and an increase in rates paid on average deposits.\n \nNoninterest income increased $35 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in wealth and asset management revenue, which increased $34 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in personal asset management revenue.\n \nAverage loans and leases decreased $258 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by\n payoffs exceeding loan production.\nAverage deposits decreased $437 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in average interest checking deposits, average demand deposits and average money market deposits as a result of lower average balances per customer account, partially offset by increases in average savings deposits and average CDs\n.\nGeneral Corporate and Other\n \nGeneral Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to its segments.\n \nNet interest income on an FTE basis increased $2.2 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in FTP credits on deposits allocated to the segments, an increase in FTP charges on loans and leases allocated to the segments, an increase in interest income on other short-term investments and decreases in interest expense on FHLB advances and retail brokered CDs. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in interest expense on long-term debt. The increase in FTP charges allocated to the segments was driven by increases in market interest rates, primarily across the fixed-rate asset portfolios. The decrease in FTP credits allocated to the segments was driven by lower assumed liquidity premiums from deposit portfolios. Under the Bancorp’s internal reporting methodology, the Bancorp insulates the segments from interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate lending by transferring this risk to General Corporate and Other through the FTP methodology. As a result, the amount of FTP credits on deposits earned by the segments generally increases or decreases at a faster pace than the amount of allocated FTP charges on loans and leases. \nThe benefit from credit losses was $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $199 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The benefit from credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by increases in allocations to the segments.\nNoninterest income decreased $80 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in the loss recognized on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, a decrease in equity method investment income and a decrease in net securities gains. The decrease in equity method investment income was primarily due to a gain on the partial disposition of an equity method investment during the second quarter of 2023.\nNoninterest expense decreased $32 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by the expense recognized in 2023 associated with the FDIC special assessment, partially offset by a decrease in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other segments and an increase in performance-based compensation.\n \n68 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nLoans and Leases\nThe Bancorp classifies its commercial loans and leases based upon primary purpose and consumer loans based upon product or collateral.

Commercial mortgage loans increased $992 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2023 and included the impact of commercial construction loans transitioning to commercial mortgage loans and increased originations. Commercial leases increased $606 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in lease originations as a result of a shift in business strategy in the second half of 2024. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.0 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of payoffs exceeding loan originations due to lower demand throughout 2024.\nConsumer loans increased $2.3 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2023 due to increases in indirect secured consumer loans, residential mortgage loans, solar energy installation loans and home equity, partially offset by decreases in other consumer loans and credit card. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $1.3 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by loan production exceeding payoffs and as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023. Residential mortgage loans increased $757 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in held-for-investment loan originations and loan purchase transactions completed in the second half of 2024. Solar energy installation loans increased $474 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increased loan originations. Home equity loans increased $272 million, or 7%, as loan originations and new advances exceeded payoffs. Other consumer loans decreased $470 million, or 16%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022.

Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $4.8 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances associated with the exit of certain lower returning facilities in the second half of 2023 and lower demand throughout 2024.\nAverage consumer loans decreased $303 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 primarily due to decreases in average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by increases in average solar energy installation loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $465 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023 and a decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average other consumer loans decreased $464 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2023 driven by paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022. Average indirect secured consumer loans decreased $361 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023, partially offset by increased loan production during 2024. Average solar energy installation loans increased $1.0 billion, or 34%, from December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased loan originations.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities \nwere\n $52.4 billion and $51.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 3.8 \nat December 31, 2024\n compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2023. The taxable held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.5 at \nDecember 31, 2024.\nDebt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management’s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading typically when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne\nar term. At December 31, 2024\n, the Bancorp’s investment securities portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities at both December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023. \nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp did not recognize an allowance for credit losses for its investment securities. The Bancorp also did not recognize provision for credit losses for investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Bancorp recognized $21 million, $5 million and $1 million, respectively, of impairment losses on available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities gains (losses), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions where the Bancorp had determined that it no longer intends to hold the securities until the recovery of their amortized cost bases.\n70 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:\nTABLE 21:  Components of Investment Securities\nAs of December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAvailable-for-sale debt and other securities (amortized cost basis):\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities\n$\n4,358\n \n4,477 \nObligations of states and political subdivisions securities\n—\n \n2 \nMortgage-backed securities:\nAgency residential mortgage-backed securities\n6,460\n \n11,564 \nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities\n23,853\n \n28,945 \nNon-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities\n4,505\n \n4,872 \nAsset-backed securities and other debt securities\n3,924\n \n5,207 \nOther securities\n(a)\n778\n \n722 \nTotal available-for-sale debt and other securities\n$\n43,878\n \n55,789 \nHeld-to-maturity securities (amortized cost basis):\n(b)\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities\n$\n2,370\n \n— \nMortgage-backed securities:\nAgency residential mortgage-backed securities\n4,898\n \n— \nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities\n4,008\n \n— \nAsset-backed securities and other debt securities\n2\n \n2 \nTotal held-to-maturity securities\n$\n11,278\n \n2 \nTrading debt securities (fair value):\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities\n$\n626\n \n647 \nObligations of states and political subdivisions securities\n120\n \n39 \nAgency residential mortgage-backed securities\n10\n \n6 \nAsset-backed securities and other debt securities\n429\n \n207 \nTotal trading debt securities\n$\n1,185\n \n899 \nTotal equity securities (fair value)\n$\n341\n \n613 \n(a)\nOther securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings that are carried at cost.\n(b)\nIncludes a discount of $865 at December 31, 2024 pertaining to the remaining unamortized portion of unrealized losses on securities transferred to HTM.\nIn January 2024, the Bancorp transferred $12.6 billion (amortized cost basis) of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to reflect the Bancorp’s change in intent to hold these securities to maturity in order to reduce potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. The transfer included U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. On the date of the transfer, pre-tax unrealized losses of $994 million were included in AOCI related to these transferred securities. The unrealized losses that existed on the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a component of AOCI and will be amortized into income over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the amortization of the discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.  \nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization of unrealized losses related to securities transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. At December 31, 2024, these transferred securities had an estimated weighted-average life of 6.9 years.\nTABLE 22:  Estimated Amortization of Unrealized Losses on Securities Transferred to Held-to-Maturity\nAs of December 31, 2024 ($ in millions)\n2025\n$\n62 \n2026\n72 \n2027\n84 \n2028\n123 \n2029\n57 \nThereafter\n467 \nUnamortized portion of unrealized losses\n$\n865 \nOn an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities comprised\n \n28% of total interest-earning assets at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

At December 31, 2024, the held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an estimated weighted-average life of 6.9 years and a weighted-average yield of 3.41%.\n71 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInformation presented in Tables 23 and 24 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. \nThe fair values of investment securities are impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp’s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen.

Other short-term investments were\n \n$17.1 billion\n at \nDecember 31, 2024, a decrease of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily associated with an increase in loans and leases, a decrease in retail brokered CDs and a decrease in total borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDeposits\nThe Bancorp’s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates and through its strategy of expanding retail presence in high-growth markets, such as in the Southeast.

Transaction deposits increased $942 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in money market deposits and interest checking deposits, partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and savings deposits.\n \nIn response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products or lower interest-bearing products into higher interest-bearing products. Money market deposits increased $2.2 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of higher balances per consumer customer account due to higher offering rates and the aforementioned balance migration. Interest checking deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the aforementioned balance migration as well as commercial balance growth, partially offset by lower balances per consumer customer account.

Average transaction deposits increased $2.3 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by\n \nincreases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits, partially offset by decreases in average demand deposits and average savings deposits.\n \nAverage CDs $250,000 or less increased $2.2 billion, or 27%, from December 31, 2023. Additionally, average CDs over $250,000 decreased $1.3 billion, or 24%, from December 31, 2023. The fluctuations in the average balances of deposits were driven by similar factors to those previously discussed with respect to the end of period balances.  \nContractual maturities\nThe contractual maturities of CDs as of December 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table:\nTABLE 27: Contractual Maturities of CDs\n(a)\n($ in millions)\nNext 12 months\n$\n12,490 \n13-24 months\n611 \n25-36 months\n28 \n37-48 months\n9 \n49-60 months\n15 \nAfter 60 months\n3 \nTotal CD\ns\n$\n13,156 \n(a)\nIncludes CDs $250,000 or less and CDs over $250,000.\nDeposit insurance\nThe FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $66.5 billion and $71.1 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp’s domestic\n \ndeposits were estimated to be uninsured. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of time deposits were estimated to be uninsured. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank’s regulators.\n74 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBorrowings\nThe Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 13% and 14% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings:\nTABLE 28: Components of Borrowings\nAs of December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nFederal funds purchased\n$\n204\n \n193 \nOther short-term borrowings\n4,450\n \n2,861 \nLong-term debt\n14,337\n \n16,380 \nTotal borrowings\n$\n18,991\n \n19,434 \nTotal borrowings decreased $443 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt partially offset by an increase in other short-term borrowings. Long-term debt decreased $2.0 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to redemptions or maturities of $3.3 billion of notes, $496 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations and $65 million of fair value adjustments associated with hedged long-term debt. These decreases were partially offset by the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in January and September of 2024 totaling $1.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024. For additional information regarding the long-term debt issuances, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other short-term borrowings increased $1.6 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from loan growth and a decrease in retail brokered CDs. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table summarizes the components of average borrowings:\nTABLE 29: Components of Average Borrowings\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nFederal funds purchased\n$\n207\n \n307 \nOther short-term borrowings\n3,024\n \n5,044 \nLong-term debt\n15,835\n \n14,260 \nTotal average borrowings\n$\n19,066\n \n19,611 \nTotal average borrowings decreased $545 million, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in average other short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average long-term debt. Average other short-term borrowings decreased $2.0 billion compared to December 31, 2023 primarily due to lower FHLB advances outstanding. Average long-term debt increased $1.6 billion compared to December 31, 2023 primarily due to the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in January and September of 2024 totaling $1.8 billion and fluctuations within the year in the amount of long-term FHLB advances outstanding. These increases were partially offset by redemptions or maturities of $3.3 billion of notes, $496 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations and $65 million of fair value adjustments associated with hedged long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2024. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp’s liquidity management. \n75 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRISK MANAGEMENT – OVERVIEW\nEffective risk management is critical to the Bancorp’s ongoing success and ensures that the Bancorp operates in a safe and sound manner, complies with applicable laws and regulations and safeguards the Bancorp’s brand and reputation. Risks are inherent in the Bancorp’s business and are influenced by both internal and external factors. The Bancorp is responsible for managing these risks effectively to deliver through-the-cycle value and performance for the Bancorp’s shareholders, customers, employees and communities.\nFifth Third’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework, which is approved annually by the ERMC, RCC and the Board of Directors, includes the following key elements:\n•\nThe Bancorp ensures transparency of risk through defined risk policies, governance and a reporting structure that includes the RCC, ERMC and other risk-specific management committees and councils.\n•\nThe Bancorp establishes a risk appetite in alignment with its strategic, financial and capital plans at the enterprise level and the line of business level. Risk appetite is defined using quantitative metrics and qualitative measures to ensure prudent risk taking that drives balanced decision making. The Bancorp’s goal is to ensure that aggregate residual risks do not exceed the Bancorp’s risk appetite, and that risks taken are supportive of the Bancorp’s portfolio diversification and profitability objectives. The Board and executive management approve the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies and forms the basis for enterprise risk management.\n•\nThe core principles that define the Bancorp’s risk appetite are as follows:\n◦\nConduct the Bancorp’s business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and in alignment with internal policies and procedures.\n◦\nAct with integrity in all activities.\n◦\nUnderstand the risks taken and ensure that they are in alignment with the Bancorp’s business strategies and risk appetite. \n◦\nAvoid risks that cannot be understood, managed or monitored.\n◦\nProvide transparency of risk to the Bancorp’s management and Board by escalating risks and issues as necessary. \n◦\nEnsure Fifth Third’s products and services are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to the Bancorp’s customers and to Fifth Third.\n◦\nOnly offer products or services that are appropriate or suitable for the Bancorp’s customers.\n◦\nFocus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate and efficient services to meet customers’ needs.\n◦\nMaintain a strong financial position to ensure the Bancorp meets its strategic objectives through all economic cycles and is able to access the capital markets at all times, even under stressed conditions.\n◦\nProtect the Bancorp’s reputation by thoroughly understanding the consequences of business strategies, products and processes.\n•\nFifth Third’s culture and values provide the foundation for supporting sound risk management practices by setting expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization. All employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with Fifth Third’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. Fifth Third’s Management Compliance Committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. Prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees and is a foundational element of Fifth Third’s culture.\n•\nThe Bancorp manages eight defined risk types to a prescribed appetite. The risk types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk.\n•\nThe Bancorp identifies and monitors existing and potential risks that may impact the company’s risk profile, including emerging risks that create uncertainties and/or would have broad implications if materialized (e.g., contagion risks, climate change, etc.). Enhanced monitoring and action plans are implemented as necessary to proactively mitigate risk.\n•\nFifth Third’s Risk Management Process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks. The five components of the Risk Management Process are: identify, assess, manage, monitor and report. The Bancorp has also established processes and programs to manage and report concentration risks, to ensure robust talent, performance and compensation management, and to aggregate risks across the enterprise.\nFifth Third drives accountability for managing risk through its Three Lines of Defense structure:\n•\nThe first line of defense is comprised of front-line units (and enterprise-wide functions that support front-line units) that create risk or are involved in risk-taking activities and are accountable for managing risk. These groups are the Bancorp’s primary risk takers and are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting on the risks associated with their activities consistent with established risk appetite and limits.\n•\nThe second line of defense, or Independent Risk Management, consists of Enterprise and Non-Financial Risk Management, Capital Markets Risk Management, Compliance, Financial Crimes, Model Risk Management, Credit Risk Management and Credit Risk Review. The second line is responsible for developing enterprise frameworks and policies to govern risk-taking activities, providing challenge and oversight of those activities, advising on controlling risk, assessing risks and issues independent of the first line of defense, and providing input on key risk decisions. Risk Management complements the front line’s management of risk-taking activities through its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, including adherence to the Bancorp Risk Appetite. Additionally, the second line of defense is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting on aggregate risks enterprise-wide.\n•\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, which provides oversight of the first and second lines of defense, and independent assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls.\n76 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\nCredit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. \nThe objective of the Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, product and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority based on risk and exposure amount, the use of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk ratings and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp’s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. Certain loans and leases with probable or observed credit weaknesses receive enhanced monitoring and undergo a periodic review. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp’s credit rating categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting.\nIn addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk rating systems. The first of these risk rating systems is based on regulatory guidance for credit risk rating systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also separately maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a “through-the-cycle” rating philosophy for assessing a borrower’s creditworthiness. This “through-the-cycle” rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen categories for estimating probabilities of default and an additional eleven categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the regulatory risk rating system.\nThe Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Bancorp’s processes for developing these models, for estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans.\nFor the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nFor collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower’s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios.\n77 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCommercial Portfolio\n \nThe Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting.\nThe Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic factors and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including, but not limited to, the level of inflation, labor and supply chain issues, volatility and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, including debt and default levels. Additionally, despite recent cuts, borrowers are expected to experience lingering effects from higher-for-longer interest rates. The Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to concentrations.\nThe Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial loans and leases outline the risks and underwriting requirements for businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry and regional expertise to better monitor and manage different industry and geographic segments of the portfolio.\n78 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides detail on commercial loans and leases by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System), by loan size and by state, illustrating the diversity and granularity of the Bancorp’s commercial loans and leases:\nTABLE 30:  Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio (excluding loans and leases held for sale)\n2024\n2023\nAs of December 31 ($ in millions)\nOutstanding\nExposure\nNonaccrual\nOutstanding\nExposure\nNonaccrual\nBy Industry:\nReal estate\n$\n14,375\n \n22,429\n \n6\n \n$\n12,558 \n19,679 \n4 \nFinancial services and insurance\n9,507\n \n19,939\n \n1\n \n9,998 \n21,022 \n— \nManufacturing\n8,850\n \n19,230\n \n68\n \n9,010 \n19,101 \n54 \nHealthcare\n5,648\n \n8,192\n \n76\n \n5,485 \n7,831 \n13 \nBusiness services\n5,596\n \n9,755\n \n113\n \n5,917 \n10,339 \n50 \nWholesale trade\n5,315\n \n10,305\n \n14\n \n5,259 \n10,414 \n6 \nAccommodation and food\n4,371\n \n6,731\n \n18\n \n4,326 \n6,946 \n25 \nRetail trade\n3,495\n \n8,429\n \n45\n \n3,953 \n9,847 \n85 \nCommunication and information\n3,304\n \n6,140\n \n74\n \n3,191 \n6,482 \n60 \nMining\n2,676\n \n5,897\n \n—\n \n2,813 \n5,940 \n— \nConstruction\n2,674\n \n6,815\n \n19\n \n2,656 \n6,391 \n10 \nTransportation and warehousing\n2,311\n \n4,124\n \n7\n \n2,382 \n4,326 \n5 \nUtilities\n1,882\n \n3,326\n \n—\n \n1,850 \n3,493 \n— \nEntertainment and recreation\n1,749\n \n3,091\n \n5\n \n1,687 \n2,964 \n8 \nOther services\n1,215\n \n1,798\n \n5\n \n1,181 \n1,680 \n6 \nAgribusiness\n204\n \n513\n \n5\n \n300 \n614 \n— \nPublic administration\n110\n \n160\n \n—\n \n151 \n240 \n— \nIndividuals\n11\n \n24\n \n—\n \n29 \n77 \n— \nTotal\n$\n73,293\n \n136,898\n \n456\n \n$\n72,746 \n137,386 \n326 \nBy Loan Size:\nLess than $1 million\n5\n \n%\n5\n \n15\n \n4 \n%\n4 \n19 \n$1 million to $5 million\n7\n \n5\n \n10\n \n7 \n6 \n11 \n$5 million to $10 million\n4\n \n4\n \n6\n \n5 \n4 \n5 \n$10 million to $25 million\n13\n \n11\n \n22\n \n14 \n11 \n23 \n$25 million to $50 million\n24\n \n22\n \n33\n \n24 \n23 \n— \nGreater than $50 million\n47\n \n53\n \n14\n \n46 \n52 \n42 \nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n100\n \n100 \n100 \n100 \nBy State:\nCalifornia\n10\n \n%\n8\n \n6\n \n10 \n%\n8 \n5 \nIllinois\n8\n \n8\n \n5\n \n9 \n8 \n5 \nTexas\n8\n \n9\n \n1\n \n9 \n9 \n1 \nOhio\n8\n \n10\n \n3\n \n8 \n11 \n6 \nFlorida\n7\n \n6\n \n8\n \n7 \n7 \n35 \nNew York\n7\n \n6\n \n12\n \n7 \n6 \n— \nMichigan\n5\n \n5\n \n6\n \n5 \n5 \n3 \nGeorgia\n4\n \n4\n \n16\n \n4 \n4 \n21 \nIndiana\n3\n \n4\n \n2\n \n3 \n3 \n1 \nTennessee\n3\n \n3\n \n10\n \n3 \n3 \n1 \nNorth Carolina\n3\n \n3\n \n1\n \n3 \n3 \n2 \nSouth Carolina\n3\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2 \n2 \n1 \nOther\n31\n \n32\n \n30\n \n30 \n31 \n19 \nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n100\n \n100 \n100 \n100 \nThe origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending.

The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. The Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Nonaccrual assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. Additionally, collateral values are also reviewed at least annually for all criticized assets.\n79 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio.

The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these six categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, specific geographic concentration risks and additional risk elements.\nThe Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a high-rate environment and as rates begin to fall. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer products fall within the Bancorp’s risk appetite. These guidelines are monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the prevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance limits.\nThe payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to changes in benchmark interest rates. Previous increases in interest rates have caused minimum payments on these products to increase, raising the potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. Recent rate cuts and potential future decreases in interest rates may lessen these risks moving forward. The impacts of these rate changes will take time to manifest and their significance will be dependent on the size and number of current and future rate cuts. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to changes in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio.\nResidential mortgage portfolio\n \nThe Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to loan characteristics determined to influence credit risk. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.\nThe Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $458 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are strong with a weighted-average origination debt-to-income ratio of 34% and weighted-average origination LTV of 72%. Approximately 43% of these loans are expected to experience an increase in rate upon reset. For those borrowers, rates are expected to increase by an average of approximately 1.9%, resulting in an average increase in monthly payment amount of approximately 26%.\nCertain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp’s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk. Approximately two-thirds of these loans consist of loans originated through the Bancorp’s loan program for doctors.\n81 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides an analysis of the residential mortgage portfolio loans outstanding by LTV at origination:\nTABLE 35:  Residential Mortgage Portfolio Loans by LTV at Origination\n2024\n2023\nAs of December 31 ($ in millions)\nOutstanding\nWeighted-Average LTV\nOutstanding\nWeighted-Average LTV\nLTV ≤ 80%\n$\n11,836\n \n63.5\n \n%\n$\n11,718 \n62.7 \n%\nLTV > 80%, with mortgage insurance\n(a)\n3,165\n \n95.5\n \n2,996 \n95.1 \nLTV > 80%, no mortgage insurance\n2,542\n \n90.9\n \n2,312 \n91.1 \nTotal\n$\n17,543\n \n73.5\n \n%\n$\n17,026 \n72.4 \n%\n(a)\nIncludes loans with either borrower or lender paid mortgage insurance.\nThe following tables provide an analysis of the residential mortgage portfolio loans outstanding by state with a greater than 80% LTV at origination and no mortgage insurance:\nTABLE 36:  Residential Mortgage Portfolio Loans, LTV Greater Than 80% at Origination, No Mortgage Insurance\nAs of December 31, 2024 ($ in millions)\nOutstanding\n90 Days Past Due and Accruing\nNonaccrual\nBy State:\nOhio\n$\n518\n \n1\n \n7\n \nIllinois\n518\n \n—\n \n5\n \nFlorida\n457\n \n—\n \n2\n \nNorth Carolina\n202\n \n—\n \n—\n \nMichigan\n167\n \n—\n \n2\n \nIndiana\n165\n \n—\n \n2\n \nKentucky\n130\n \n—\n \n1\n \nAll other states\n385\n \n—\n \n5\n \nTotal\n$\n2,542\n \n1\n \n24\n \nTABLE 37:  Residential Mortgage Portfolio Loans, LTV Greater Than 80% at Origination, No Mortgage Insurance\nAs of December 31, 2023 ($ in millions)\nOutstanding\n90 Days Past Due and Accruing\nNonaccrual\nBy State:\nOhio\n$\n512 \n— \n8 \nIllinois\n462 \n1 \n4 \nFlorida\n407 \n— \n1 \nNorth Carolina\n163 \n— \n1 \nMichigan\n167 \n— \n1 \nIndiana\n166 \n— \n2 \nKentucky\n123 \n— \n1 \nAll other states\n312 \n— \n5 \nTotal\n$\n2,312 \n1 \n23 \nNet charge-offs on residential mortgage loans with an LTV greater than 80% at origination and no mortgage insurance were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2024 and there were net recoveries of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nHome equity portfolio \nThe Bancorp’s home equity portfolio of $4.2 billion is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp’s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 21% of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp’s portfolio of home equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately $594 million of the balances mature before December 31, 2028.\nThe home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 39, Table 40 and Table 41.

The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes.\nThe following table provides an analysis of home equity portfolio loans outstanding disaggregated based upon refreshed FICO score:\nTABLE 38:  Home Equity Portfolio Loans Outstanding by Refreshed FICO Score\n2024\n2023\nAs of December 31 ($ in millions)\nOutstanding\n% of Total    \nOutstanding\n% of Total    \nSenior Liens:\nFICO ≤ 659\n$\n111\n \n3\n \n%\n$\n109 \n2 \n%\nFICO 660-719\n160\n \n4\n \n187 \n5 \nFICO ≥ 720\n1,013\n \n24\n \n1,052 \n27 \nTotal senior liens\n$\n1,284\n \n31\n \n%\n$\n1,348 \n34 \n%\nJunior Liens:\nFICO ≤ 659\n242\n \n6\n \n218 \n6 \nFICO 660-719\n521\n \n12\n \n460 \n12 \nFICO ≥ 720\n2,141\n \n51\n \n1,890 \n48 \nTotal junior liens\n$\n2,904\n \n69\n \n%\n$\n2,568 \n66 \n%\nTotal\n$\n4,188\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n3,916 \n100 \n%\nThe Bancorp believes that home equity portfolio loans with a greater than 80% LTV (including senior liens, if applicable) present a higher level of risk.

A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 48. For further information on the Bancorp’s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nNonperforming assets were $860 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $689 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, $7 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $1 million at December 31, 2023.\nNonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.71% and 0.59% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As described in Note \n1\n of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments). The Bancorp’s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp’s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable.\nThe Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL in order to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but are not fully captured within the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models. These may include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers, changes in product structures or changes in economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models. Qualitative factor adjustments may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. Given the diverse circumstances that necessitate the consideration of qualitative factors, the specific factors which are determined to be relevant and their relative significance to the ALLL vary from period to period. \nIn addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp’s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nFor collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp’s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower’s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions.\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp’s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp’s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession.\nThe Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time and worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse.\nDecember 31, 2024 ACL\nThe ACL as of December 31, 2024 decreased $2 million from December 31, 2023, as the favorable impacts of improvements in the risk profile of the loan and lease portfolio and changes in consumer loan portfolio mix were partially offset by the impacts of higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases in specific reserves. As of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp’s macroeconomic scenarios included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by expected interest rate cuts and geopolitical risks. At December 31, 2024, the Bancorp assigned an 80% probability weighting to the Baseline scenario and 10% to each of the Upside and Downside scenarios. \n90 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, economic growth remained resilient despite restrictive monetary policy. The FOMC continues to seek a soft landing for the economy while balancing the risks of cutting rates too soon with the risks of maintaining a restrictive policy for too long. Seeing positive momentum in inflation trending toward its long-term target of 2%, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 25 bps in both November and December 2024. \nThe Baseline scenario used in the December 31, 2024 ACL assumed that the normalization of inflation rates will take longer than previously expected when considering recent trends and additional inflationary pressures that may arise from changes in U.S. fiscal, tariff and immigration policies. This scenario assumed a rise in inflation mid-2025, increasing to 2.7% by the end of 2026 and not approaching the 2% target before early 2027. In response to fiscal tightening and high interest rates, this scenario also assumed that real GDP growth would be below trend in the near term but that the unemployment rate will remain steady. The Baseline scenario assumed an average annual real GDP growth rate of 2.2% for 2025, followed by 1.6% in 2026 and 1.8% in 2027. The Baseline scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 4.1% for 2025, 2026 and 2027. While the Treasury rate environment is relatively stable with the 10-year yield remaining in a range between 4.24% and 4.33%, credit spreads are projected to expand from 1.5% at the start of the scenario to a peak of 2.60% in early 2027. Lastly, the Baseline scenario assumed additional cuts to the target federal funds rate beyond 2024, with an average federal funds rate of 4.1% in 2025 that decreases to an average of 3.4% and 3.0% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. \nThe Upside scenario assumed that, on an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 3.2% in 2025, 2.4% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. The Upside scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026 and 3.5% in 2027. 10-year Treasury yields are fairly stable reaching a peak of 4.43% at the end of 2025, while credit spreads are consistent with the baseline scenario peaking at 2.57% in 2027. In the Upside scenario, the forecast for federal funds rate cuts was generally consistent with the Baseline scenario. \nThe Downside scenario included significant worsening of economic conditions, causing the U.S. economy to fall into a recession in the first quarter of 2025. The Downside scenario assumed that real GDP declines from the fourth quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025, with a cumulative decline of 2.6%, modestly recovering to an average annualized GDP growth rate of 0.4% for the full year of 2026 and 2.7% for the full year of 2027. The Downside scenario assumed an average unemployment rate of 7.3% in 2025, increasing to an average of 8.0% in 2026 and decreasing to an average of 6.6% in 2027. The 10-year treasury yield increases to 4.51% in mid-2025, then drops to 3.07% by the end of the third quarter of 2025. Credit spreads also expand in this scenario reaching a peak of 3.89% in the third quarter of 2025. In the Downside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate included steeper rate cuts than the Baseline scenario, with average target rates of 4.1% in 2025, followed by 1.7% and 1.1% in 2026 and 2027, respectively.\nThe Bancorp’s qualitative adjustments resulted in a net increase to the ACL as of December 31, 2024, primarily driven by a qualitative increase in the ACL for the commercial portfolio segment. These qualitative adjustments primarily reflect the Bancorp’s expectations that additional credit losses may be present in its portfolio loans and leases beyond what is predictable through the use of quantitative models. The qualitative increase for the commercial portfolio segment was primarily driven by additional allowances for certain nonowner-occupied commercial loans secured by real estate, particularly loans secured by office buildings, based on current challenges in the commercial real estate market that are not fully reflected in the Bancorp’s quantitative models. These challenges include, but are not limited to, an imbalance between supply and demand in the market for commercial real estate properties and pressures on borrowers and property valuations resulting from elevated interest rates. Specific to office properties, the Bancorp has also observed industry data indicating that the office sector of the commercial real estate market continues to lag behind others in terms of property values, driven in part by lessened demand as a result of the increased prevalence of remote work across many professions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe Bancorp’s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $2.1 billion. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted.\n91 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the Bancorp’s ACL:\nTABLE 52:  Changes in Allowance for Credit Losses\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nALLL:\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n2,322\n \n2,194 \n1,892 \nLosses charged-off\n(a)\n(686)\n(522)\n(362)\nRecoveries of losses previously charged-off\n(a)\n154\n \n134 \n135 \nProvision for loan and lease losses\n562\n \n565 \n529 \nImpact of adoption of ASU 2022-02\n—\n \n(49)\n— \nBalance, end of period\n$\n2,352\n \n2,322 \n2,194 \nReserve for unfunded commitments:\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n166\n \n216 \n182 \n(Benefit from) provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments\n(32)\n(50)\n34 \nBalance, end of period\n$\n134\n \n166 \n216 \n(a)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Bancorp recorded $28, $35 and $32, respectively, in both losses charged-off and recoveries of losses previously charged-off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the Bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit enhancements.\n92 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides an attribution of the Bancorp’s ALLL to portfolio loans and leases:\nTABLE 53:  Attribution of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses to Portfolio Loans and Leases\nAs of December 31 ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAttributed ALLL:\nCommercial and industrial loans\n$\n728\n \n767 \nCommercial mortgage loans\n351\n \n284 \nCommercial construction loans\n59\n \n66 \nCommercial leases\n16\n \n13 \nResidential mortgage loans\n146\n \n145 \nHome equity\n106\n \n102 \nIndirect secured consumer loans\n311\n \n271 \nCredit card\n165\n \n227 \nSolar energy installation loans\n351\n \n292 \nOther consumer loans\n119\n \n155 \nTotal ALLL\n$\n2,352\n \n2,322 \nPortfolio loans and leases:\nCommercial and industrial loans\n$\n52,271\n \n53,270 \nCommercial mortgage loans\n12,246\n \n11,276 \nCommercial construction loans\n5,588\n \n5,621 \nCommercial leases\n3,188\n \n2,579 \nResidential mortgage loans\n(a)\n17,543\n \n17,026 \nHome equity\n4,188\n \n3,916 \nIndirect secured consumer loans\n16,313\n \n14,965 \nCredit card\n1,734\n \n1,865 \nSolar energy installation loans\n4,202\n \n3,728 \nOther consumer loans\n2,518\n \n2,988 \nTotal portfolio loans and leases\n$\n119,791\n \n117,234 \nAttributed ALLL as a percent of respective portfolio loans and leases:\nCommercial and industrial loans\n1.39\n \n%\n1.44 \nCommercial mortgage loans\n2.87\n \n2.52 \nCommercial construction loans\n1.06\n \n1.17 \nCommercial leases\n0.50\n \n0.50 \nResidential mortgage loans\n0.83\n \n0.85 \nHome equity\n2.53\n \n2.60 \nIndirect secured consumer loans\n1.91\n \n1.81 \nCredit card\n9.52\n \n12.17 \nSolar energy installation loans\n8.35\n \n7.83 \nOther consumer loans\n4.73\n \n5.19 \nTotal ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases\n1.96\n \n%\n1.98 \nTotal ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases\n2.08\n \n2.12 \n(a)\n Includes $108 and $116 of residential mortgage loans measured at fair value at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Bancorp’s ALLL may vary significantly from period to period based on changes in economic conditions, economic forecasts and the composition and credit quality of the Bancorp’s loan and lease portfolio.

This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp’s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest-sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons:\n•\nAssets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times;\n•\nShort-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or\n•\nThe expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.\nIn addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp’s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp’s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. \nManagement continually reviews the Bancorp’s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of key risk indicators and early warning indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk.\nThe Commercial Banking and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Consumer and Small Business Banking line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp’s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM and Board-approved key risk indicators are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance.\nThe Bancorp’s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Corporate Credit Committee (accountable to the ERMC), provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The Bancorp’s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks, including those for Mortgage and Treasury activities.\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity\n \nThe Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management’s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. The NII simulation model does not represent a forecast of the Bancorp’s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of market interest rate environments. As a result, actual results will differ from simulated results for multiple reasons, which may include actual balance sheet composition differences, timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected customer behavioral assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp’s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons under parallel and non-parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Risk appetite thresholds are utilized for scenarios assuming a 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates over 12-month and 24-month horizons. The Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in rates, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve, and employs key risk indicators and early warning indicators to monitor and manage exposures under these types of scenarios. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the basis between interest rates.\nIn order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance migration or attrition in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity modeling assumes additional attrition of approximately $470 million of demand deposit balances over a period of 24 months for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $470 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. The incremental balance attrition and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes.\n94 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnother important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which the Bancorp’s interest-bearing deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorp utilizes dynamic deposit beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels. The dynamic beta models were developed utilizing the Bancorp’s performance during prior interest rate cycles. Since the beginning of the recent tightening cycle in early 2022 and through December 31, 2024, the Bancorp’s actual cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was approximately 55%-60%. Using the dynamic beta models, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity modeling assumes weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit betas at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of approximately 75%-80% for both a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates. In the event of continued rate cuts, this approach assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of approximately 65%-70% for both a 100 bps and 200 bps decrease in rates. In falling rate scenarios, deposit rate floors are utilized to ensure modeled deposit rates will not become negative. NII simulation modeling assumes no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. Future actual performance will be dependent on market conditions, the level of competition for deposits and the magnitude of continued interest rate increases. The Bancorp provides sensitivity analysis in Tables 55 and 56 for key assumptions related to its deposit modeling, including beta and demand deposit balance performance.\nThe Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities.\nThe following table shows the Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile and policy limits as of December 31:\nTABLE 54:  Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and Policy Limits\n2024\n2023\n % Change in NII  (FTE)\nPolicy Limit\n% Change in NII  (FTE) \nPolicy Limit\nChange in Interest Rates (bps)\n12 \nMonths \n13-24 \nMonths \n12 \nMonths \n13-24 \nMonths \n12 \nMonths \n13-24 \nMonths \n12 \nMonths \n13-24\nMonths\n+200 Ramp over 12 months\n(3.57)\n%\n(4.00)\n(6.00)\n(7.00)\n(2.55)\n%\n(4.89)\n(5.00)\n(6.00)\n+100 Ramp over 12 months\n(1.75)\n(1.84)\nN/A\nN/A\n(1.26)\n(2.30)\nN/A\nN/A\n-100 Ramp over 12 months\n0.94\n0.24\nN/A\nN/A\n0.28\n0.32\nN/A\nN/A\n-200 Ramp over 12 months\n1.57\n(0.27)\n(6.00)\n(7.00)\n0.17\n(0.19)\n(5.00)\n(6.00)\nTable 54 presents the change in estimated net interest income for 12 month and 13-24 month horizons for alternative interest rate scenarios relative to the net interest income projection for a static rate scenario for those same time horizons. As previously mentioned, these numbers do not represent a forecast, but are instead risk measures that are monitored to evaluate the consolidated interest rate risk position of the Bancorp. At December 31, 2024, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity in the rising-rate scenarios is negative in years one and two as interest expense is expected to increase more than interest income due to deposit repricing and balance migration estimates given the high interest rate environment. The Bancorp’s NII simulation projects an increase in NII in years one and two under the parallel 100 bps ramp decrease in interest rates and in year one in the 200 bps ramp decrease in interest rates, driven by an expectation that deposits would reprice faster than earning assets. However, in year two, some deposits have reached their floors but assets continue to reprice to lower rates, generating less NII. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to December 31, 2023 were primarily attributable to increases in fixed-rate loans and interest-bearing core deposits combined with reduced wholesale funding.\nTables 55 and 56 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp’s estimated NII profile at December 31, 2024 to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity (beta) assumptions.\nThe following table includes the Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile with an immediate $1 billion decrease and an immediate $1 billion increase in demand deposit balances as of December 31, 2024:\nTABLE 55:  Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile at December 31, 2024 with a $1 Billion Change in Demand Deposit Assumption\n% Change in NII (FTE)\nImmediate $1 Billion Balance  Decrease\nImmediate $1 Billion Balance  Increase\nChange in Interest Rates (bps)\n12    \nMonths    \n13-24  \nMonths  \n12  \nMonths  \n13-24  \nMonths  \n+200 Ramp over 12 months\n(4.46)\n%\n(4.97)\n(2.68)\n(3.03)\n+100 Ramp over 12 months\n(2.56)\n(2.66)\n(0.95)\n(1.02)\n-100 Ramp over 12 months\n0.32 \n(0.27)\n1.57 \n0.75 \n-200 Ramp over 12 months\n1.03 \n(0.63)\n2.11 \n0.10 \n95 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table includes the Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile with a 10% increase and a 10% decrease to the corresponding deposit beta assumptions as of December 31, 2024:\nTABLE 56:  Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile at December 31, 2024 with Deposit Beta Assumptions Changes\n% Change in NII (FTE)\nBetas 10% Higher\n(a)\nBetas 10% Lower\n(a)\nChange in Interest Rates (bps)\n12  \nMonths\n13-24  \nMonths  \n12  \nMonths  \n13-24  \nMonths  \n+200 Ramp over 12 months\n(5.17)\n%\n(6.95)\n(2.06)\n(1.37)\n+100 Ramp over 12 months\n(2.55)\n(3.30)\n(1.00)\n(0.54)\n-100 Ramp over 12 months\n1.67 \n1.52 \n0.26 \n(0.90)\n-200 Ramp over 12 months\n2.98 \n2.07 \n0.23 \n(2.31)\n(a)\nApplies a +/- 10% multiple on assumed betas.\nEconomic Value of Equity Sensitivity\nThe Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool to govern and manage its interest rate risk exposure. The exposure is governed by a risk framework that uses risk appetite thresholds for scenarios assuming an instantaneous 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates. The Bancorp routinely analyzes exposures to other interest rate scenarios and employs key risk indicators to monitor and manage exposures. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and two-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate any assumptions related to continued production or renewal activities used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits.\nThe following table shows the Bancorp’s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31:\nTABLE 57:  Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile\n2024\n2023\nChange in Interest Rates (bps)\n% Change in  EVE\nPolicy Limit\n% Change in  EVE\nPolicy Limit\n+200 Shock\n(6.57)\n%\n(12.00)\n(3.68)\n(12.00)\n+100 Shock\n(3.04)\nN/A\n(1.49)\nN/A\n-100 Shock\n1.79\n \nN/A\n0.65 \nN/A\n-200 Shock\n2.48\n \n(12.00)\n(1.67)\n(12.00)\n \nThe EVE sensitivity is negative in both a +200 bps and +100 bps rising-rate scenario and positive in both a -200 bps and -100 bps falling-rate scenario at December 31, 2024. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from December 31, 2023 were primarily related to changes in forward interest rate expectations, mix-shift of deposit composition into higher beta products, an increase in fixed-rate loans and reduced wholesale funding, which was partially offset by shortening of the investment portfolio duration. \nWhile an instantaneous shift in spot interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates.\nThe Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, basis risks relative to the Prime Rate and various SOFR terms, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.\nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk\nAn integral component of the Bancorp’s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its \n96 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ninterest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities.\nTables 58 and 59 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp’s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index, to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Fifth Third’s asset and liability management activities:\nTABLE 58:  Summary of Qualifying Hedging Instruments\nWeighted-Average\nAs of December 31, 2024 ($ in millions)\nNotional Amount  \nFair Value\nRemaining (years) \nFixed Rate  \nIndex\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed\n$\n11,000\n \n(2)\n5.7\n3.05\n \n%\nSOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed – forward starting\n(a)\n1,000\n \n1\n \n7.0\n3.20\n \nSOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans – cash flow – receive-fixed – forward starting\n(a)\n4,000\n \n3\n \n7.1\n3.50\n \nSOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to long-term debt – fair value – receive-fixed\n4,955\n \n(11)\n4.7\n5.04\n \nSOFR\nTotal interest rate swaps\n$\n20,955\n \n(9)\n(a)\nForward starting swaps will become effective in January and February 2025.\nTABLE 59:  Summary of Qualifying Hedging Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2023 ($ in millions)\nNotional Amount  \nFair Value\nRemaining (years) \nFixed Rate  \nIndex\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed\n$\n8,000 \n(9)\n4.4\n3.02 \n%\nSOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed – forward starting\n(a)\n6,000 \n5 \n7.8\n3.11 \nSOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans – cash flow – receive-fixed – forward starting\n(a)\n4,000 \n— \n8.1\n3.50 \nSOFR\nInterest rate swaps related to long-term debt – fair value – receive-fixed\n5,955 \n(32)\n4.9\n5.18 \nSOFR\nTotal interest rate swaps\n$\n23,955 \n(36)\nInterest rate floors related to C&I loans – cash flow – receive-fixed\n$\n3,000 \n1 \n1.0\n2.25 \nSOFR\n(a)\nForward starting swaps will become effective on various dates between June 2024 and February 2025.\nAdditionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well. Refer to the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure.\nThe Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n97 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPortfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk\nAlthough the Bancorp’s portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the Bancorp’s portfolio loans and leases, excluding interest receivable, disaggregated by scheduled principal repayment, as of December 31, 2024:\nTABLE 60:  Cash Flows from Portfolio Loans and Leases \n($ in millions)\nDue in 1 year or less\nDue after 1 year through 5 years\nDue after 5 years through 15 years\nDue after 15 years\nTotal\nCommercial and industrial loans\n$\n11,581 \n38,582 \n2,088 \n20 \n52,271 \nCommercial mortgage loans\n3,763 \n7,147 \n1,232 \n104 \n12,246 \nCommercial construction loans\n2,188 \n3,219 \n174 \n7 \n5,588 \nCommercial leases\n763 \n2,090 \n254 \n81 \n3,188 \nTotal commercial loans and leases\n18,295 \n51,038 \n3,748 \n212 \n73,293 \nResidential mortgage loans\n936 \n2,914 \n6,479 \n7,214 \n17,543 \nHome equity\n279 \n577 \n379 \n2,953 \n4,188 \nIndirect secured consumer loans\n3,312 \n9,638 \n2,900 \n463 \n16,313 \nCredit card\n1,734 \n— \n— \n— \n1,734 \nSolar energy installation loans\n194 \n550 \n1,756 \n1,702 \n4,202 \nOther consumer loans\n1,026 \n887 \n556 \n49 \n2,518 \nTotal consumer loans\n7,481 \n14,566 \n12,070 \n12,381 \n46,498 \nTotal portfolio loans and leases\n$\n25,776 \n65,604 \n15,818 \n12,593 \n119,791 \nThe following table displays a summary of cash flows, excluding interest receivable, occurring after one year for both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate loans and leases as of December 31, 2024:\nTABLE 61:  Cash Flows from Portfolio Loans and Leases Occurring After One Year\nInterest Rate\n($ in millions)\nFixed  \nFloating or Adjustable\nCommercial and industrial loans\n$\n4,338 \n36,352 \nCommercial mortgage loans\n1,956 \n6,527 \nCommercial construction loans\n123 \n3,277 \nCommercial leases\n2,425 \n— \nTotal commercial loans and leases\n8,842 \n46,156 \nResidential mortgage loans\n12,410 \n4,197 \nHome equity\n354 \n3,555 \nIndirect secured consumer loans\n12,994 \n7 \nSolar energy installation loans\n4,008 \n— \nOther consumer loans\n1,252 \n240 \nTotal consumer loans\n31,018 \n7,999 \nTotal portfolio loans and leases\n$\n39,860 \n54,155 \nResidential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk\nThe fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $1.7 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. For further information on the significant drivers and components of the valuation adjustments on MSRs, refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp’s foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $861 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure \n98 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nto foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management.\nCommodity Risk\nThe Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management.\n99 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT \nThe goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe Bancorp’s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp’s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios.\nLiquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp (parent company) receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon.\nThe Bancorp’s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management.\nSources of Funds \nThe Bancorp’s primary sources of funds include revenue from noninterest income as well as cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of borrowings.\nTable 60 of the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A presents information about the timing of cash flows from loan and lease repayments. The Bancorp’s available-for-sale debt and other securities and held-to-maturity securities portfolios had a fair value of $50.5 billion at December 31, 2024. From these portfolios, $8.2 billion in principal and interest payments are expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $8.6 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp’s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.\nAsset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp’s ability to \nmonetize loans, leases and investment securities through a variety of channels, including repurchase agreements, outright sales, securitizations or pledging to secured borrowing sources. \nIn order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans, solar energy installation loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. The Bancorp sold or securitized loans and leases totaling \n$4.4 billion\n during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $7.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. For further information, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCore deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp’s average core deposits and average shareholders’ equity funded 86\n%\n and 85% of its average total assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. \nIn June of 2023, the Board of Directors authorized $10.0 billion of debt or other securities for issuance, of which $7.0 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance a\ns of December 31, 2024\n. The Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. The Bancorp issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes of $1.0 billion in January 2024 and $750 million in September 2024, as further discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n100 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Bank’s global bank note program had a borrowing capacity of \n$25.0 billion\n, of which\n $20.4 billion\n was available for issuance. Additionally, at December 31, 2024, the Bank had approximately \n$67.6 billion\n of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources, including the FRB and the FHLB. \nFor further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 32. \nCurrent Liquidity Position\nThe Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over\n \n$100 billion in current available liquidity. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for more information regarding the Bancorp’s deposit portfolio characteristics. The Bancorp maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources, while supplementing with a variety of secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources across the maturity spectrum, which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. The Bancorp’s investment portfolio remains highly concentrated in liquid and readily marketable instruments and is a significant source of secured borrowing capacity via several monetization channels. As part of its liquidity management activities, the Bancorp maintains collateral at its secured funding providers to ensure immediate availability of funding. Additionally, the Bancorp executes periodic test trades to assess the operational processes and market depth associated with its secured funding sources.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp (parent company) had sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary for 33\n months.\nThe Bancorp and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various types of contracts. In addition to commitments to extend credit and letters of credit (which are further discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), these include deposits, lease obligations, partnership investment commitments, derivative contracts, borrowings, and pension benefit payments. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A and Notes 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 and 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these contractual obligations.\nCredit Ratings \nThe cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp’s or Bank’s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp’s or Bank’s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.\nThe Bancorp’s and Bank’s credit ratings are summarized in Table 62. The ratings reflect the ratings agency’s view on the Bancorp’s and Bank’s capacity to meet financial commitments.*  \n*As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency. \nTABLE 62:  Agency Ratings\nAs of February 24, 2025\n \nMoody’s\n \nStandard and \nPoor’s\n \nFitch\n \nDBRS Morningstar\nFifth Third Bancorp:\n \n \n \n \nShort-term borrowings\n \nNo rating\n \nA-2\n \nF1\n \nR-1L\nSenior debt\n \nBaa1\n \nBBB+\n \nA-\n \nA\nSubordinated debt\n \nBaa1\n \nBBB\n \nBBB+\n \nAL\nFifth Third Bank, National Association:\n \n \n \n \nShort-term borrowings\n \nP-2\n \nA-2\n \nF1\n \nR-1M\nShort-term deposit\n \nP-1\n \nNo rating\n \nF1\n \nNo rating\nLong-term deposit\n \nA1\n \nNo rating\n \nA\n \nAH\nSenior debt\n \nA3\n \nA-\n \nA-\n \nAH\nSubordinated debt\n \nA3\n \nBBB+\n \nBBB+\n \nA\nRating Agency Outlook for Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association:\n \nStable\n \nStable\n \nStable\nStable\n101 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n \nOperational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct or adverse external events that are neither market- nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorp’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, poor design or delivery of products and services, cybersecurity or physical security incidents and privacy breaches or failure of third parties to perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, reputational damage, litigation and regulatory fines or other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorp’s risk management goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorp’s risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.\nTo control, monitor and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions and providing independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). Business Controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day-to-day operational risk (first line of defense).\nThe Bancorp’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the Bancorp’s approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management. These include programs, such as risk and control self-assessments, product delivery risk assessments, scenario analysis, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, Third-Party Risk Management, cybersecurity risk management, review of operational losses and monitoring of significant organizational or process changes. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes support the Bancorp’s goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorp’s performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred.\nThe Bancorp also maintains a robust information security program to support the management of cybersecurity risk within the organization with a focus on prevention, detection and recovery processes. Refer to Part I, Item 1C of this report for more information, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nExternal threats remain elevated which may result in increased fraud and cybersecurity risks. The Bancorp’s strategic initiatives also have the potential to increase operational risk as changes to process and technology are implemented. Other factors such as increased reliance on third parties, reliance on data and increased use of cloud-based technologies as well as the use of emerging technologies such as generative models and artificial intelligence may introduce additional operational risk considerations. These risks continue to be carefully managed and monitored to ensure effective controls are in place, with appropriate oversight and governance by the second line of defense.\nFifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of operational control issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Operational Risk Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of operational risk across the enterprise. The Information Security Governance Committee and Model Risk Committee report to the Operational Risk Committee and are responsible for governance of information security and model risks. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the RCC of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association.\nThe Bancorp is aware of and actively monitoring climate-related risks. Climate-related risks could impact the Bancorp in the form of physical risks due to acute or chronic weather-related events that could disrupt the operations of the Bancorp or could impair the ability of clients to meet financial obligations. The Bancorp also faces transition risk resulting from economic transition towards a lower-carbon future which may negatively impact some clients or present credit, strategic or reputational risks to the Bancorp. \nClimate risk is a priority for management and accordingly the Board oversees both the RCC and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The RCC is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of Fifth Third’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework including climate risks. In the course of business, the Bancorp’s Environmental Risk Group works with partners to manage or mitigate environmental risks including climate-related risks. As part of its larger environmental, social and governance responsibilities the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing climate strategy and climate-related issues in the context of stakeholder concerns.\n102 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT \nLegal and regulatory compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Third’s activities and functions. Legal risks include the risk of actions against the institution that result in unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, legal sanctions, or adverse judgments, which disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of the institution. Failure to effectively manage such risks can elevate the risk level or manifest itself as other types of key risks, including reputational or operational risk. Fifth Third focuses on managing legal and regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorp’s integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Bancorp’s risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels, consistent with the Bancorp’s risk appetite.\nTo mitigate such risks, Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to foster consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program and ensures that lines of business and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring legal and regulatory compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. Moreover, such strategies are modified from time to time to respond to new or emerging risks in the environment. Compliance Risk Management and the Legal Division provide guidance to the lines of business and enterprise functions, which are ultimately responsible for managing such risks associated with their areas. The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for formulating and directing the strategy, development, implementation, communication and maintenance of the Compliance Risk Management program, which implements key compliance processes, including but not limited to, executive- and board-level governance and reporting routines, compliance-related policies, risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory change management and regulatory compliance testing and monitoring. In partnership with Compliance Risk Management, the Financial Crimes Division conducts and oversees anti-money laundering and economic sanctions processes. Compliance Risk Management also partners with the Corporate Responsibility Office to oversee the Bancorp’s compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.\nFifth Third also reports and escalates legal and regulatory compliance risks to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Management Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee oversees Bancorp-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments, regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of legal and regulatory compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the RCC of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank, National Association.\n103 Fifth Third Bancorp\nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \nManagement regularly reviews the Bancorp’s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. \nRegulatory Capital Ratios \nThe Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of “well-capitalized” for insured depository institutions. For additional information regarding the prescribed capital ratios, refer to Note 29 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp’s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. At \nDecember 31, 2024 and \n2023\n,\n the Bancorp’s stress capital buffer requirement was 3.2% and 2.5%, respectively. The Bancorp’s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented.\nThe Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. \nThe Bancorp’s modified CECL transition amount began phasing out on January 1, 2022, and will be fully phased-out by January 1, 2025. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp’s regulatory capital at December 31, 2024 was an increase in capital of approximately $124 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp’s CET1 capital ratio would be reduced by 7 bps as of December 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the Bancorp’s capital ratios as of December 31:\nTABLE 63:  Capital Ratios\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAverage total Bancorp shareholders’ equity as a percent of average assets\n9.12\n \n%\n8.49 \n9.22 \nTangible equity as a percent of tangible assets\n(a)(b)\n9.02\n \n8.65 \n8.31 \nTangible common equity as a percent of tangible assets\n(a)(b)\n8.03\n \n7.67 \n7.30 \nRegulatory capital:\n(c)\nCET1 capital\n$\n17,339\n \n16,800 \n15,670 \nTier 1 capital\n19,455\n \n18,916 \n17,786 \nTotal regulatory capital\n22,746\n \n22,400 \n21,606 \nRisk-weighted assets\n164,102\n \n163,223 \n168,909 \nRegulatory capital ratios:\n(c)\nCET1 capital\n10.57\n \n%\n10.29 \n9.28 \nTier 1 risk-based capital\n11.86\n \n11.59 \n10.53 \nTotal risk-based capital\n13.86\n \n13.72 \n12.79 \nLeverage\n9.22\n \n8.73 \n8.56 \n(a)\nThese are non-GAAP measures.

Under the Enhanced Prudential Standards tailoring rules, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The Bancorp is also subject to the FRB’s supervisory stress tests every two years. The Bancorp was subject to the 2024 supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB and submitted its Board-approved capital plan and information contained in Schedule C - Regulatory Capital Instruments, as required, by the April 5, 2024 deadline.\nDividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program\n \nThe Bancorp’s Capital Management and Dividend Policy reflects its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of \n$1.44,\n $1.36 and \n$1.26 \nduring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and \n2022\n, respectively. \n104 Fifth Third Bancorp \nTable of Contents\n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn June of 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the Bancorp to repurchase up to 100 million common shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and to utilize any derivative or similar instrument to effect share repurchase transactions. Under this authorization, t\nhe Bancorp entered into and settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended December 31, 2024 and \n2023\n. Refer to Note 24 and Note \n32\n of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the accelerated share repurchase activity. \nThe following table summarizes shares authorized for repurchase as part of publicly announced plans or programs:\nTABLE 64:  Share Repurchases\nFor the years ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nShares authorized for repurchase at January 1\n32,115,811\n \n37,705,807 \nAdditional authorizations\n—\n \n— \nShare repurchases\n(a)\n(15,043,170)\n(5,589,996)\nShares authorized for repurchase at December 31\n17,072,641\n \n32,115,811 \nAverage price paid per share\n(a)\n$\n41.87\n \n35.78 \n(a)\nExcludes 1,866,182 and 1,649,542 shares repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with various employee compensation plans.
