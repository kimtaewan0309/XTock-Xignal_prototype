MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended \nAugust 29, 2024\n. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2025 and 2024 each contain 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts.\nOverview\nWe are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life \nfor all\n. With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, manufacturing, and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience.\nWe manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global network of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it also brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams such as research and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of inflationary pressures and regulatory uncertainty. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending.\nProduct Technologies\nOur product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products through our business units into various markets in numerous forms, including: components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, multi-chip packages, and wafers. Many of our system-level solutions combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM.\nDRAM:\n DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used in the data center, client PC, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets.\nNAND\n:\n NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a variety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the data center, client PC, consumer, and automotive markets and in removable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and embedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and home networking.\n29 |\n \n2025 Q3 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nNOR\n:\n NOR products are non-volatile, re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly used for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for frequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications.\nIndustry Conditions\nIn the third quarter of 2025, DRAM revenue improved from the prior quarter due to improvements across end markets, in particular strong sequential growth in consumer-oriented and data center markets, especially for HBM products. During the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024, we have shifted our supply to meet the strong demand in data center DRAM resulting in a portfolio mix weighted more towards high-growth segments. In 2024 and for the first nine months of 2025, we experienced substantial improvements in revenue, pricing, and margins as compared to 2023, reflecting demand growth, driven in part by deployment of AI, which resulted in a substantially improved industry supply and demand balance. \nIn the third quarter of 2025, NAND revenue improved from the prior quarter due to improvements across end markets, in particular strong bit growth in consumer-oriented markets due to reduced customer inventories. We saw reduced demand from NAND customers in the first two quarters of 2025 as customers reduced inventory to align with their end customers. We continue to prudently manage our NAND supply, including the levels of our capital investment, the pace of ramp of our new technology node, and fab utilization consistent with our demand growth.\n \n30\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nThird Quarter\nSecond Quarter\nThird Quarter\nNine Months Ended\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenue\n$\n9,301 \n100 \n%\n$\n8,053 \n100 \n%\n$\n6,811 \n100 \n%\n$\n26,063 \n100 \n%\n$\n17,361 \n100 \n%\nCost of goods sold\n5,793 \n62 \n%\n5,090 \n63 \n%\n4,979 \n73 \n%\n16,244 \n62 \n%\n14,485 \n83 \n%\nGross margin\n3,508 \n38 \n%\n2,963 \n37 \n%\n1,832 \n27 \n%\n9,819 \n38 \n%\n2,876 \n17 \n%\nResearch and development\n965 \n10 \n%\n898 \n11 \n%\n850 \n12 \n%\n2,751 \n11 \n%\n2,527 \n15 \n%\nSelling, general, and administrative\n318 \n3 \n%\n285 \n4 \n%\n291 \n4 \n%\n891 \n3 \n%\n834 \n5 \n%\nOther operating (income) expense, net\n56 \n1 \n%\n7 \n— \n%\n(28)\n— \n%\n61 \n— \n%\n(267)\n(2)\n%\nOperating income (loss)\n2,169 \n23 \n%\n1,773 \n22 \n%\n719 \n11 \n%\n6,116 \n23 \n%\n(218)\n(1)\n%\nInterest income (expense), net\n12 \n— \n%\n(4)\n— \n%\n(14)\n— \n%\n(3)\n— \n%\n(28)\n— \n%\nOther non-operating income (expense), net\n(68)\n(1)\n%\n(11)\n— \n%\n10 \n— \n%\n(90)\n— \n%\n(24)\n— \n%\nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n(235)\n(3)\n%\n(177)\n(2)\n%\n(377)\n(6)\n%\n(695)\n(3)\n%\n172 \n1 \n%\nEquity in net income (loss) of equity method investees\n7 \n— \n%\n2 \n— \n%\n(6)\n— \n%\n10 \n— \n%\n(11)\n— \n%\nNet income (loss)\n$\n1,885 \n20 \n%\n$\n1,583 \n20 \n%\n$\n332 \n5 \n%\n$\n5,338 \n20 \n%\n$\n(109)\n(1)\n%\nTotal Revenue:\n Total revenue for the third quarter of 2025 and first nine months of 2025 was impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. \nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2025 increased 15% as compared to the second quarter of 2025 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products.\n•\nSales of DRAM products increased 15% primarily due to an over 20% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a low-single-digit percent range decrease in average selling prices primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.\n•\nSales of NAND products increased 16% primarily due to a mid-20% range increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a high-single-digit percent range decrease in average selling prices.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2025 increased 37% as compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products.\n•\nSales of DRAM products increased 51% primarily due to a mid-20% range increase in average selling prices and an increase in bit shipments in the low-20% range.\n•\nSales of NAND products increased 4% primarily due to a low-30% range increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a low-20% range decrease in average selling prices. \nTotal revenue for the first nine months of 2025 increased 50% as compared to the first nine months of 2024 due to increases in both DRAM and NAND sales.\n•\nSales of DRAM products increased 60% primarily due to a high-40% range increase in average selling prices and a high-single-digit percent range increase in bit shipments.\n•\nSales of NAND products increased 29% primarily due to a high-teen percentage range increase in bit shipments and a high-single-digit percent range increase in average selling prices.\n31 |\n \n2025 Q3 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Gross Margin\n:\n \nOur consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. Our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 38% for the third quarter of 2025 from 37% for the second quarter of 2025, primarily due to an improvement in margins for DRAM products, partially offset by a decrease in margins for NAND products. DRAM margins improved primarily due to an increased mix of HBM and manufacturing cost reductions driven by improvements in product and process technology. NAND margins declined primarily due to decreases in average selling prices. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 38% for the third quarter of 2025 from 27% for the third quarter of 2024 and improved to 38% for the first nine months of 2025 from 17% for the first nine months of 2024. Improvements in our consolidated gross margins for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to corresponding periods of 2024 were primarily due to increases in average selling prices for DRAM products, manufacturing cost reductions, and an increased mix in sales of high-margin cloud products, particularly HBM. Our consolidated gross margin for the first nine months of 2024 reflected $987 million of benefit due to lower costs from the sale of inventories written down to their net realizable value in 2023.\nRevenue by Business Unit\nThird Quarter\nSecond Quarter\nThird Quarter\nNine Months Ended\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nCNBU\n$\n5,069 \n54 \n%\n$\n4,564 \n57 \n%\n$\n2,573 \n38 \n%\n$\n14,028 \n54 \n%\n$\n6,495 \n37 \n%\nSBU\n1,451 \n16 \n%\n1,392 \n17 \n%\n1,353 \n20 \n%\n4,574 \n18 \n%\n2,911 \n17 \n%\nMBU\n1,551 \n17 \n%\n1,068 \n13 \n%\n1,588 \n23 \n%\n4,146 \n16 \n%\n4,479 \n26 \n%\nEBU\n1,227 \n13 \n%\n1,025 \n13 \n%\n1,294 \n19 \n%\n3,304 \n13 \n%\n3,442 \n20 \n%\nAll other\n3 \n— \n%\n4 \n— \n%\n3 \n— \n%\n11 \n— \n%\n34 \n— \n%\n \n$\n9,301 \n$\n8,053 \n$\n6,811 \n$\n26,063 \n$\n17,361 \nPercentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding.\nChanges in revenue for each business unit for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the second quarter of 2025 were as follows:\n•\nCNBU revenue increased 11% primarily due to higher sales of HBM products, which increased nearly 50%, along with growth in our high-capacity DRAM and low-power server DRAM.\n•\nSBU revenue increased 4% primarily due to increases in bit shipments driven by increased demand in consumer markets.\n•\nMBU revenue increased 45% primarily due to increases in bit shipments driven by reduced customer inventories and strong demand from DRAM content growth, partially offset by declines in average selling prices for both mobile DRAM and NAND.\n•\nEBU revenue increased 20% primarily due to increases in bit shipments driven by demand in industrial and embedded consumer markets.\nChanges in revenue for each business unit for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2024 were as follows:\n•\nCNBU revenue increased 97% and 116%, respectively, primarily due to increases in average selling prices and bit shipments driven by improved demand, particularly in cloud server markets, including HBM.\n•\nSBU revenue increased 7% for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices for NAND.

We completed reorganization of our operations and organizational structure and began to manage operations under our new segment structure effective in the fourth quarter of 2025. The changes will require us to recast our segment reporting and we will report financial results under this new structure starting with our 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Segment and Other Information.”\nOperating Expenses and Other\nResearch and Development: \nR&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. \n33 |\n \n2025 Q3 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nR&D expenses for the third quarter of 2025 increased 7% as compared to the second quarter of 2025 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and higher volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers. R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2025 increased 14% as compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and higher volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers. R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2025 increased 9% as compared to the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to increases in employee compensation and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers.\nSelling, General, and Administrative: \nSG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2025 increased 12% as compared to the second quarter of 2025 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation. SG&A expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 increased 9% and 7%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation.\nOther Operating (Income) Expense, Net: \nSee “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net.”\nIncome Taxes: \nOur income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:\nThird Quarter\nSecond Quarter\nThird Quarter\nNine Months Ended\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIncome (loss) before taxes\n$\n2,113 \n$\n1,758 \n$\n715 \n$\n6,023 \n$\n(270)\nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n(235)\n(177)\n(377)\n(695)\n172 \nEffective tax rate\n11.1 \n%\n10.1 \n%\n52.7 \n%\n11.5 \n%\n63.7 \n%\nThe change in our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily due to discrete items related to tax return filings during the second quarter of 2025. The change in our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 and the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the respective periods in 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability. \nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $240 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.21) for the third quarter of 2025, $171 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.15) for the second quarter of 2025, and $623 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.55) for the first nine months of 2025, respectively. As a result of the low level of profitability and geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented for 2024.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective tax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens percentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate.\nVarious tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements.\nOther:\n \nFurther information related to our operating expenses and other can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”:\n•\nDebt\n•\nEquity Compensation Plans\n \n34\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $12.21 billion as of May 29, 2025, and $9.15 billion as of August 29, 2024. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of May 29, 2025, $4.80 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We expect to engage in a variety of financing transactions, from time to time, for such purposes as well as to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of May 29, 2025, $3.50 billion was available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives, which are subject to various conditions and may not be obtained.\nTo develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $14 billion. Actual amounts for 2025 will vary depending on market conditions and may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures and proceeds from government incentives. As of May 29, 2025, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.69 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases and debt, see “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Leases,” and “ – Debt.”\nTo support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the CHIPS Act, we announced plans to invest in leading-edge memory manufacturing sites in Idaho and New York, based on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. \nAs part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with first DRAM wafer output projected in the second half of calendar 2027. In June 2025, in connection with certain amendments to our CHIPS Act agreements, we announced plans for a second leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Idaho to serve growing market demand fueled by AI. \nOur announced plan for New York includes construction of a leading-edge DRAM memory manufacturing site, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp after the completion of the second Idaho fab. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity, in line with industry demand trends and our objective of maintaining stable bit share.\nOn December 9, 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Boise, Idaho and two planned fabs in Clay, New York. On June 11, 2025, we entered into amendments to the direct funding agreements to add a second planned fab in Boise, Idaho and allocate certain award funding to the second planned Idaho fab from the $6.1 billion grants previously awarded. The direct funding for up to $6.1 billion remains unchanged. We elected not to pursue the federal loans previously disclosed as included in the non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for the Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York fabs. On June 11, 2025, we also entered into a direct funding agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $275 million in direct funding to expand and modernize our fab in Manassas, Virginia. The grants under the funding agreements represent total CHIPS Act grants of up to $6.4 billion in connection with our U.S. manufacturing expansion and modernization projects. In addition, we announced plans to bring advanced HBM packaging capabilities to the U.S. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” \nIn addition to the CHIPS Act direct funding, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the State of \n35 |\n \n2025 Q3 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nNew York that provides for up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages.\nAdditionally, we have established cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, and have recently received the EUV lithography tool that will support production of advanced DRAM. We are expanding our production capacity in Taiwan for DRAM and HBM products to meet rising market demand. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We are expanding our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China. Construction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade. In January 2025, we broke ground on an HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore to meaningfully expand our total advanced packaging capacity beginning in calendar 2027.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through May 29, 2025, we had repurchased an aggregate of $7.19 billion of the authorized amount. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity” and “Item 1.
