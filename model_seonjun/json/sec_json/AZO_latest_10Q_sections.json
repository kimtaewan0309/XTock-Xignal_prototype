We began operations in 1979 and at May 10, 2025, operated 6,537 stores in the U.S., 838 stores in Mexico and 141 stores in Brazil. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light duty trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. At May 10, 2025, in 6,011 of our domestic stores as well as the vast majority of our stores in Mexico and Brazil, we had a commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts and other products and commercial credit to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, fleet owners and other accounts. We also sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. Additionally, we sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic, repair, collision and shop management software through www.alldata.com. We also provide product information on our Duralast branded products through www.duralastparts.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services. Our websites and the information contained therein or linked thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this report.\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOperating results for the twelve and thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 30, 2025. Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 or 17 weeks. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 has 16 weeks, and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 had 17 weeks. Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales generally occurring during the months of February through September, and the lowest sales generally occurring in the months of December and January. \nExecutive Summary\nNet sales increased to $4.5 billion, a 5.4% increase over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating profit decreased 3.8% to $866.2 million, net income decreased 6.6% to $608.4 million and diluted earnings per share decreased 3.6% to $35.36 for the quarter. The third quarter was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates which had an overall impact to net sales of $89.3 million. Operating profit comparison was negatively impacted $27.1 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and $8.0 million net due to an unfavorable non-cash LIFO impact.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2025, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 86% of total sales, whereas they represented approximately 85% of total sales in the comparable prior year period. Failure related categories continue to be the largest portion of our sales mix. \nWe did not experience any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to the previous year. Our sales mix can be impacted by weather over a short-term period. Over the long-term, we believe the impact of weather on our sales mix is not significant.\nOur business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumers and our industry, including but not limited to inflation, interest rates, levels of consumer debt, fuel and energy costs, prevailing wage rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, tariffs, trade policies and other geopolitical factors, hiring and other economic conditions. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.\nThe two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. For the twelve-month period ended March 2025, miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.0% compared to the same period in the prior year, based on the latest information available from the U.S. Department of Transportation. According to S&P Global Mobility, as of 2025 the average age of light vehicles on the road in the U.S. was 12.8 years.\nTwelve Weeks Ended May 10, 2025\nCompared with Twelve Weeks Ended May 4, 2024\nNet sales for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, increased $228.9 million to $4.5 billion, or 5.4% over net sales of $4.2 billion for the comparable prior year period. This growth was driven by an increase in total company same store sales of 5.4% on a constant currency basis and net sales of $97.2 million from new domestic and international stores, partially offset by a $89.3 million impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Domestic commercial sales increased $123.2 million to $1.3 billion, or 10.7% over the comparable prior year.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSame store sales, or sales for our domestic and international stores open at least one year, are as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTwelve Weeks Ended\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nConstant Currency\n (1)\n​\n​\n​\nMay 10, 2025\n​\nMay 4, 2024\n​\nMay 10, 2025\n​\nMay 4, 2024\nDomestic\n​\n 5.0\n%  \n​\n 0.0\n%  \n​\n 5.0\n%  \n​\n 0.0\n%  \nInternational\n \n(9.2\n%)  \n​\n 18.1\n%  \n \n 8.1\n%  \n \n 9.3\n%  \nTotal Company\n \n 3.2\n%  \n​\n 1.9\n%  \n \n 5.4\n%  \n \n 0.9\n%  \n(1)\nConstant currency same store sales exclude impacts from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates by converting both the current year and prior year international results at the prior year foreign currency exchange rate.\nGross profit for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, was $2.4 billion, compared with $2.3 billion during the comparable prior year period. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 52.7% for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, compared to 53.5% for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was negatively impacted by \nhigher inventory shrink, higher commercial mix, new distribution center startup costs and an unfavorable 21-basis point ($8 million net) non-cash LIFO impact\n. \nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $1.5 billion compared with $1.4 billion during the comparable prior year period. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were 33.3% compared with 32.2% during the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in our self-insurance expense and investments to support our growth initiatives. \nNet interest expense was $111.3 million and $104.4 million for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively. Average borrowings were $9.2 billion and $8.8 billion, and weighted average borrowing rates were 4.48% and 4.43% for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively.\nOur effective income tax rate was 19.4% and 18.1% of pretax income for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively. The benefit from stock options exercised was $22.7 million and $38.1 million for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025 and the comparable prior year period, respectively.\nNet income for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, decreased by $43.3 million from the comparable prior year period to $608.4 million due to the factors set forth above, and diluted earnings per share decreased by 3.6% to $35.36 from $36.69. The impact on current quarter diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases since the end of the comparable prior year period was an increase of $0.26 per share.\nThirty-six Weeks Ended May 10, 2025\nCompared with Thirty-six Weeks Ended May 4, 2024\nNet sales for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, increased $411.1 million to $12.7 billion, or 3.3% over net sales of $12.3 billion for the comparable prior year period. This growth was driven by an increase in total company same store sales of 3.4% on a constant currency basis and net sales of $233.5 million from new domestic and international stores, partially offset by a $238.4 million impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Domestic commercial sales increased $230.2 million to $3.5 billion, or 7.1% over the comparable prior year period.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSame store sales, or sales for our domestic and international stores open at least one year, are as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThirty-Six Weeks Ended\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nConstant Currency\n (1)\n​\n​\n​\nMay 10, 2025\n​\nMay 4, 2024\n​\nMay 10, 2025\n​\nMay 4, 2024\nDomestic\n​\n 2.4\n%  \n​\n 0.5\n%  \n​\n 2.4\n%  \n​\n 0.5\n%  \nInternational\n​\n(5.7\n%)  \n​\n 22.2\n%  \n​\n 10.4\n%  \n​\n 10.2\n%  \nTotal Company\n​\n 1.4\n%  \n​\n 2.7\n%  \n​\n 3.4\n%  \n​\n 1.5\n%  \n(1)\nConstant currency same store sales exclude impacts from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates by converting both the current year and prior year international results at the prior year foreign currency exchange rate.\nGross profit for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, was $6.7 billion, compared with $6.6 billion during the comparable prior year period. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 53.2% compared to 53.4% during the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was negatively impacted by higher supply chain costs, higher inventory shrink, and an unfavorable 20 basis point ($24.0 million net) non-cash LIFO impact, partially offset by higher merchandise margins.\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $4.3 billion compared with $4.1 billion during the comparable prior year period. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were 34.2% compared with 33.1% during the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in our self-insurance expense and investments to support our growth initiatives.\nNet interest expense was $327.7 million and $298.4 million for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively. Average borrowings were $9.1 billion and $8.5 billion, and weighted average borrowing rates were 4.45% and 4.35% for the thirty-six week periods ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively.\nOur effective income tax rate was 20.4% and 19.8% of pretax income for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively. The tax rate was impacted by an $18.4 million favorable valuation allowance adjustment related to our international business. The benefit from stock options exercised for the thirty-six week period ended May 10, 2025, was $42.3 million compared to $72.3 million in the comparable prior year period.\nNet income for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, decreased by $98.9 million from the comparable prior year period to $1.7 billion due to the factors set forth above, and diluted earnings per share decreased by 2.0% to $96.17 from $98.11. The impact on current year to date diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases since the end of the comparable prior year period was an increase of $0.38.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products and accessories. We believe that our cash generated from operating activities and available credit, supplemented with our long-term borrowings, will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As of May 10, 2025, we held $268.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $2.2 billion in undrawn capacity on our Revolving Credit Agreement. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business, repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the short-term and long-term. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. However, decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns would negatively impact our ability to generate cash from operating activities. Decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreements and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Agreement. In the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. All of our material borrowing arrangements are described in greater detail in “Note H – Financing” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Except for the issuance of $500 million 5.125% Senior Notes due June 2030, repayments of the $400 million 3.250% Senior Notes due April 2025 and the $500 million 3.625% Senior Notes \n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndue April 2025, and the $225.5 million increase in commercial paper, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2024. \nFor the thirty-six week periods ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, our net cash flows from operating activities provided $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Cash flows from operations increased over last year primarily due to favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nOur net cash flows used in investing activities for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $917.3 million as compared with $916.3 million in the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $885.6 million compared to $725.9 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by our growth initiatives, including \nnew stores and hub and mega hub store expansion projects\n. During the thirty-six week periods ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, we opened 163 and 96 net new stores, respectively. Investing cash flows were impacted by our wholly-owned captive, which purchased $54.3 million and $17.6 million, and sold $54.8 million and $21.2 million in marketable debt securities during the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, and the comparable prior year period, respectively.\n Our investment in tax credit equity investments was $50.4 million and $193.3 million during the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, and the comparable prior year period, respectively.\nOur net cash flows used in financing activities for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $1.3 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the comparable prior year period. During the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, we had $500 million in debt issuances compared to $1.0 billion in debt issuances in the comparable prior year period, and $900 million in debt repayments compared to $300 million in debt repayments in the comparable prior year period. Stock repurchases were $1.1 billion in the current thirty-six week period versus $2.4 billion in the comparable prior year period. The treasury stock repurchases were primarily funded by cash flows from operations. For the thirty-six week periods ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, we had $225.5 million and $631.3 million in net proceeds from commercial paper, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock from exercises of stock options for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, provided $111.0 million and $154.4 million, respectively. \nDuring fiscal 2025, we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2024. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our g\nrowth initiatives, which include new stores and hub and mega hub store expansion projects\n. The amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors, including whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment) and whether such buildings are located in the U.S., Mexico or Brazil, or located in urban or rural areas.\nIn addition to the building and land costs, our new stores require working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our suppliers’ ability to factor their receivables from us. \nThe Company has arrangements with third-party financial institutions to confirm invoice balances owed by the Company to certain suppliers and pay the financial institutions the confirmed amounts on the invoice due dates. These arrangements allow the Company’s inventory suppliers, at their sole discretion, to enter into agreements with these financial institutions to finance the Company’s obligations to the suppliers at terms negotiated between the suppliers and the financial institutions. Supplier participation is optional and our obligations to our suppliers, including the amount and dates due, are not impacted by our suppliers’ decision to enter into an agreement with a third-party financial institution. \nA downgrade in our credit or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions’ and our suppliers’ willingness to participate in these arrangements; however, we do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows. We plan to continue negotiating extended terms with our suppliers, benefitting our working capital and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 115.6% at May 10, 2025, and 119.7% at May 4, 2024. \nDepending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may \n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbe funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing based on our current credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.\n​\nFor the trailing four quarters ended May 10, 2025, our adjusted after-tax return on invested capital (“ROIC”), which is a non-GAAP measure, was 43.5% as compared to 51.4% for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted ROIC is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). We use adjusted ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.\nOur adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (“EBITDAR”) ratio, which is a non-GAAP measure, was 2.5:1 as of May 10, 2025 and May 4, 2024. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, financing lease liabilities and rent times six; and we calculate EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and share-based compensation expense to net income. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is calculated on a trailing four quarter basis. We target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. We believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. To the extent EBITDAR increases, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if EBITDAR decreases, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.\nDebt Facilities \nOn November 15, 2024, we amended the Revolving Credit Agreement, extending the termination date by one year. As amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate, and all amounts borrowed will be due and payable, on November 15, 2028.\nThe Senior Notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience both a change of control and a rating event (both as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our Senior Notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. \nAs of May 10, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements.\n \nSee “Note H – Financing” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning our revolving credit agreement, outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds commitment and Senior Notes.\nStock Repurchases\nSee “Note I – Stock Repurchase Program” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our share repurchases. \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted After-Tax ROIC and Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors. Additionally, our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our underlying operating results and the Compensation Committee of the Board uses select measures to determine payments of performance-based compensation against pre-established targets.\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted After-Tax ROIC and Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR provide additional information for determining our optimal capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value. \nWe have included reconciliations of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following reconciliation tables.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted After-Tax ROIC\nThe following tables calculate the percentages of adjusted ROIC for the trailing four quarters ended May 10, 2025, and May 4,
