We provide information solutions for businesses, governments and consumers, and we provide human resources business process automation and outsourcing services for employers. We have a large and diversified group of clients, including financial institutions, corporations, government agencies and individuals. Our services are based on comprehensive databases of consumer and business information derived from numerous sources including credit, financial assets, telecommunications and utility payments, employment, income, educational history, criminal justice data, healthcare professional licensure and sanctions, demographic and marketing data. We use advanced statistical techniques, machine learning and proprietary software tools to analyze available data to create customized insights, decision-making and process automation solutions and processing services for our clients. We are a leading provider of information and solutions used in payroll-related and human resource management business process services in the United States of America (“U.S.”), as well as e-commerce fraud and charge back protection services in North America. For consumers, we provide products and services to help people understand, manage and protect their personal information and make more informed financial decisions. Additionally, we also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management.\nWe currently operate in four global regions: North America (U.S. and Canada), Asia Pacific (Australia, New Zealand and India), Europe (the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay). We maintain support operations in Chile, Costa Rica, India and Ireland. We also have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. \n \nEquifax was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in 1913, and its predecessor company dates back to 1899. As used herein, the terms Equifax, the Company, we, our and us refer to Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Equifax Inc.\nWe are organized and report our business results in three operating segments, as follows:\n \n•\nWorkforce Solutions\n \n—\n provides services enabling customers to verify income, employment, educational history, criminal justice data, healthcare professional licensure and sanctions of people in the U.S. (Verification Services), as well as providing our employer customers with services which include unemployment claims management, I-9 and onboarding services, Affordable Care Act compliance management, tax credits and incentives and other complementary employment-based transaction services (Employer Services). Workforce Solutions revenue is predominantly in the U.S., and they have also established operations in Canada, Australia and the U.K.\n•\nU.S. Information Solutions (“USIS”)\n \n—\n provides consumer and commercial information solutions to businesses in the U.S. including online information, decisioning technology solutions, identity management services, analytical services, e-commerce fraud and charge back protection services, portfolio management services, mortgage information and marketing services. We provide products to consumers in the U.S. to enable them to understand and monitor their credit and help protect their identity. We also sell consumer credit information to resellers who may combine our information with other information to provide direct-to-consumer monitoring, reports and scores.\n•\nInternational\n \n—\n provides products and services similar to those available in the USIS operating segment but with variations by geographic region. We also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management. In addition, we provide products to consumers in Canada, the U.K., Australia and Chile to enable them to understand and monitor their credit and help protect their identity. This operating segment is comprised of our Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and Canada business units. It also includes our joint ventures in Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore.\n2\nOur Business Strategy\n \nOur vision is to be a trusted global leader in data, analytics and technology that creates innovative solutions and insights for our customers. Our business strategy is driven by the following imperatives:\n•\nLeverage our Equifax Cloud capabilities to accelerate innovation, new products and growth.\n Our cloud data and technology transformation has changed nearly every facet of our global technology infrastructure, including a migration to a public cloud environment that employs virtual private cloud deployment techniques. Central to our move to cloud-native technology is our custom single data fabric, which is a cloud native platform that enables Equifax to build, manage and deploy data products, as well as implementation of best-in-class cloud-based tools and capabilities. Our growth strategy includes leveraging our cloud data and technology transformation to accelerate innovation and new product development, deliver market-leading capabilities to our customers, facilitate customer and partner implementation and integration, improve ease of consumer access to and interaction with Equifax, and strengthen system resiliency and uptime.\n•\nLeverage and expand our differentiated portfolio of data assets.\n We use proprietary advanced analytical platforms, including capabilities in machine learning, artificial intelligence and advanced visualization tools, to leverage our unique data to develop leading analytical insights that enhance the precision of our customers’ decisioning activities. Our cloud-native technology simplifies our customers’ access to our leading analytical and decisioning platforms, allowing us to accelerate the development of unique insights and the conversion of these insights into innovative new products and services consumable by our customers through our delivery platforms. We strive to advance these capabilities and bring our customers multi-data solutions at scale by expanding our unique and differentiated data assets and analytics through organic growth, business acquisitions and partnerships.\n•\nFoster a culture of putting customers and consumers first.\n We are focused on maintaining a culture in which our customers and consumers are at the center of our decision processes, and where we exceed customer and consumer expectations by delivering solutions with speed, flexibility, stability and performance. We prioritize engagement with our customers and strive to accelerate innovation through collaboration. We seek to leverage our cloud native technology and unique data assets and capabilities, as well as customer expertise and data and technology assets, to drive the development of high-value analytical products and services designed to address a broader range of customer and consumer needs. We work to maximize the value of our differentiated data assets, analytics and decisioning to drive new products and services that provide a fuller picture of consumers and commercial entities to our customers in banking and financial services, government, employee hiring and onboarding and other service providers. \n•\nExecute strategic acquisitions that expand our data portfolio and capabilities and drive revenue growth. \nA critical lever of our strategy is inorganic growth through accretive and strategic acquisitions that drive incremental annual revenue growth. Our acquisition priorities are clear and focused on re-investing in acquisitions that expand our unique differentiated data assets and solutions to strengthen and grow our core businesses. We continue to invest, including through acquisitions and partnerships, to expand our addressable markets and the data and capabilities we offer to solve customer challenges across the services we provide and to expand our access to differentiated data including across identity authentication, fraud mitigation and risk management. We believe there are opportunities to continue to expand in the U.S. and internationally, across the existing financial, mortgage, telecommunications, automotive, insurance, talent management, human resource services, government and other markets that we serve, as well as in new and emerging market segments.\n•\nContinue our leadership in data security. \nWe are committed to being an industry leader in security. We have built an Equifax culture that prioritizes security, and we consider data and technology security, and more broadly risk management, as a primary requirement in all decisions. We make extensive use of advanced data and technology security tools, techniques, services and processes in order to enhance our ability to protect the information with which we are entrusted. We are committed to working openly with our peers, customers and partners to tackle emerging security challenges, document best practices, provide vital data security thought leadership and work together to deliver solutions that benefit both the security community and consumers.\n•\nBuild a world-class Equifax team by investing in talent to drive our strategy and promote a culture of innovation. \nAt Equifax, we are committed to nurturing a culture where talent thrives. We are focused on providing meaningful opportunities for career advancement and development, fostering an inclusive work environment, and promoting employee engagement and recognition. We leverage our enterprise-wide talent \n3\ninitiatives to develop, retain and attract a highly-qualified workforce in order to promote our culture of innovation, add diverse perspectives and deliver on our business strategy.\nWe seek to enhance shareholder value through the disciplined execution of these imperatives and by positioning our Company as a global data, analytics and technology leader with industry-leading security.\nMarkets and Clients\n \nOur products and services serve clients across a wide range of verticals, including mortgage, financial services, employers, government (state, federal and local), automotive, commercial, identity and fraud, consumer, resellers, healthcare, telecommunications, retail and insurance. We also serve consumers directly. Our revenue streams are highly diversified with our largest client providing approximately 3% of total revenue. The following table summarizes the various end-user markets we serve:\n1.\nPredominantly sold to companies who serve the direct-to-consumer market and includes other small end user markets. Mortgage and auto resellers are excluded from this category as they are included within their respective categories above.\n2.\nOther includes revenue from other miscellaneous end-user markets.\nWe market our products and services primarily through our own direct sales organization that is structured around sales teams that focus on client segments typically aligned by vertical markets and geography. In the U.S., the vertical market sales teams for the Mortgage, Financial, Government and Automotive markets sell products from both the USIS and Workforce Solutions business units. Sales groups are based in field offices located throughout the U.S., including our headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and in the countries where we have operations. We also market our products and services through indirect channels, including alliance partners, joint ventures and other resellers. In addition, we market our products directly to consumers through e-commerce channels.\n \nRevenue from international clients, including end users and resellers, amounted to 24% of our total revenue in 2024, 23% of our total revenue in 2023 and 22% of our total revenue in 2022.\nProducts and Services\n \nOur products and services help our clients make more informed decisions with higher levels of confidence by leveraging a broad array of data assets. Analytics are used to derive insights from the data that are most relevant for the client’s decisioning needs. The data and insights are then processed through proprietary software and generally transmitted to the client’s operating system to execute the decision.\n \n4\nThe following chart summarizes the key products and services offered by each of the business units within our segments:\nWorkforce Solutions\nUSIS\nInternational\nVerification Services\nEmployer Services\nOnline Information Solutions\nFinancial Marketing Services\nEurope\nAsia Pacific\nLatin America\nCanada\nOnline data\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nPortfolio management services\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nAnalytical services\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nTechnology services \nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nIdentity verification services\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nFraud management services\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nMarketing services\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nDirect-to-consumer services\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nEmployment and income verification services\nX\nX\nX\nX\nTalent management\nX\nX\nBusiness process outsourcing (BPO)\nX\nX\nX\nDebt collection software, services and analytics\nX\nX\nX\n \nEach of our operating segments is described more fully below. For the operating revenue, operating income and total assets for each segment, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\n \nWorkforce Solutions\n \nWorkforce Solutions operates in the U.S. through two business units:\n \nVerification Services.\n  Verification Services include employment, income, educational history, criminal justice data, healthcare professional licensure and sanctions verification services. Our online verification services enable third-party verifiers, including various governmental agencies, mortgage originators, credit card and automotive lenders and pre-employment screeners, to verify the employee’s employment status and income information. We also offer an offline manual verification service, which expands employment verification to locate data outside our existing automated database. In addition, Verification Services administers a comprehensive source of incarceration, justice and people-based risk intelligence data.\n \nEmployer Services.\n  These services are aimed at reducing the cost of the human resources function of businesses through a broad suite of services, including assisting with employment tax matters designed to reduce the cost of unemployment claims through effective claims representation and management and efficient processing to better manage the tax rate that employers are assessed for unemployment taxes; comprehensive services designed to research the availability of employment-related tax credits (e.g., federal work opportunity tax credits and employee retention credits), and to process the necessary filings and assist the client in obtaining the tax credit; tax form management services (which include initial distribution, reissuance and correction of W-2 and 1095-C forms); I-9 management services designed to help clients electronically comply with the immigration laws that require employers to complete an I-9 form for each new hire; immigration case management services; onboarding services using an online platform to complete the new hire process for employees of corporations and government agencies; and identity theft protection services. In addition, we provide software and services to employers to assist in their compliance with the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Work Number\n®\n is our key employment and income data platform providing a service on behalf of our employer customers to the lenders, government agencies and other customers of our Verification Services business unit. We rely on payroll data received from over four million organizations to provide up-to-date verifications. The updates occur as employers and other data contributors transmit data electronically to Equifax from their payroll systems. Employers provide this data to us so that we can handle verification requests on behalf of each employer. We use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to verifiers who are lenders, employers/background screeners and government agencies.\n \nThe fees we charge for services in these two business units are generally on a per transaction basis. We have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the platform because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to The Work Number\n®\n, and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to third-party employment verification requests while providing them with the assurance that the \n5\nprocess is automated and not subject to human interpretation. The Work Number\n®\n held about 188 million active and 734 million total (active and historic) employment records at December 31, 2024.\nWorkforce Solutions has established an income and employment verification service in Canada, Australia and the U.K., known as Verification Exchange. At present, revenues from these services in all three regions mentioned are insignificant.\nUSIS\n \nUSIS provides consumer and commercial information solutions to businesses in the U.S. through three product and service lines, as follows:\nOnline Information Solutions.\n  Online Information Solutions’ products are derived from multiple large and comprehensive databases of consumer and commercial information that we maintain about individual consumers and businesses, including credit history, current credit status, payment history, address and other identity information. Our clients utilize the information and analytical insights we provide to make decisions for a broad range of financial and business purposes, such as whether, and on what terms, to approve auto loans or credit card applications, and whether to allow a consumer or a business to open a new utility or telephone account. In addition, this information is used by our clients for cross-selling additional products to existing customers, improving their underwriting and risk management decisions, and authenticating and verifying consumer and business identities. We also sell consumer and credit information to resellers who may combine our information with other information to provide services to the financial, mortgage, fraud and identity management, and other end-user markets. Our software platforms and analytical capabilities can integrate all types of information, including third-party and client information, to enhance the insights and decisioning process to help further mitigate the risk of granting credit, predict the risk of bankruptcy, indicate the applicant’s risk potential for account delinquency, ensure the identity of the consumer and reduce exposure to fraud. Identity verification and fraud management products combine financial and non-financial identity information and activity to provide identity verification and authentication services, to assist customers in assessing the risk of loss due to account takeover, identity theft and chargebacks. These risk management services enable our clients to monitor risks and opportunities and proactively manage their portfolios.\nOnline Information Solutions’ clients access products through a full range of electronic distribution mechanisms, including direct real-time access, which facilitates instant decisions. We also develop and host customized applications that enhance the decision-making process for our clients. These decisioning technology applications assist with a wide variety of decisioning activities, including determining pre-approved offers, cross-selling of various products, determining deposit amounts for telephone and utility companies and verifying the identity of their customers. We have also compiled commercial databases regarding businesses in the U.S., which include loan, credit card, public records and leasing history data, trade accounts receivable performance and Secretary of State and Securities and Exchange Commission registration information. We offer scoring and analytical services that provide additional information to help mitigate the credit risk assumed by our clients. \nOnline Information Solutions also includes our consumer solutions product suite that gives U.S. consumers information to enable them to understand and monitor their credit and to monitor and help protect their identity. Equifax products offer monitoring features for consumers who are concerned about identity theft, including credit report monitoring from all three credit bureaus, internet scanning, bank account monitoring and lost wallet support. Products may also be available indirectly through relationships with business partners who distribute our products or provide these services to their employees or customers. We also sell consumer credit information to resellers who may combine our information with other information to provide direct-to-consumer monitoring, reports and scores.\nMortgage Solutions.\n  Our Mortgage Solutions products, offered in the U.S., consist of specialized credit reports that combine information from the three major consumer credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) into a single “merged” credit report in an online format, commonly referred to as a tri-merge report. Mortgage lenders use these tri-merge reports in making their mortgage underwriting decisions. Additionally, we offer services designed to alert lenders to changes in a consumer’s credit status during the underwriting period and securitized portfolio risk assessment services for evaluating inherent portfolio risk.\n \nFinancial Marketing Services.\n  Our Financial Marketing Services products utilize consumer and commercial financial information enabling our clients to more effectively manage their marketing efforts, including targeting and segmentation, to identify and acquire new clients for their products and services; to develop portfolio strategies to minimize risk and maximize profitability; and to realize additional revenue from existing customers through more effective cross-selling of additional products and services. Our products are also utilized by customers to support digital identity verification and fraud detection and protection. These products utilize information derived from consumer and commercial information, including credit, \n6\nincome, asset, liquidity, net worth and spending activity, which also support many of our Online Information Solutions’ products. These data assets broaden the understanding of consumer and business financial potential and opportunity, which can further drive high value decisioning and targeting solutions for our clients. We also provide account review services, which assist our clients in managing their existing customers and prescreen services that help our clients identify new opportunities with their customers. Clients for these products primarily include institutions in the banking, brokerage, retail, insurance and mortgage industries, as well as companies primarily focused on digital and interactive marketing.\n  \nInternational\n \nThe International operating segment includes our Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada business units. These business units offer products that are similar to those available in the USIS operating segment, but with variations by geographic region. In some jurisdictions, data sources tend to rely more heavily on government agencies than in the U.S. We also offer specialized services that help our customers better manage risk in their consumer portfolios. This operating segment’s products and services generate revenue in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Spain, the U.K. and Uruguay. We also maintain support operations in Chile, Costa Rica, India and Ireland. We have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. We also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management in Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.\n \nLatin America.\n  Our Latin America operation provides consumer and commercial information solutions products, marketing products and consumer credit protection products. We offer a full range of products, generated from credit records that we maintain, including credit reporting and scoring, decisioning technology, risk management, identity management, authentication and fraud detection services. Our consumer products are the primary source of revenue in each of the countries in this region in which we operate, with the exception of Mexico where debt management services constitute the core of the business. We also offer various commercial products, which include credit reporting, decisioning tools and risk management services, in the countries we serve. We also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management. Additionally, we provide a variety of consumer and commercial marketing products generated from our credit information databases, including business profile analysis, business prospect lists and database management. The countries in this region in which we operate include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. We also have an investment in a consumer credit information company through a joint venture in Brazil.\n \nEurope.\n  Our Europe operation provides information solutions, fraud detection services, debt collection services,  marketing products, and credit monitoring products to resellers or directly to consumers. Information solutions and fraud products are generated from information that we maintain and include credit reporting, monitoring and scoring, asset information, risk management, identity management and authentication services and fraud detection and modeling services. These products are sold in the U.K. and Spain. Limited marketing products are available in the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, in Spain. We also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management in the U.K. and Spain. In the U.K., this includes a contract to provide these services to the U.K. government.\nAsia Pacific.\n \nOur Asia Pacific operation provides consumer and commercial information solutions products, marketing products, employment verification services and consumer credit protection products. We offer a full range of products, generated from credit records and other data, including credit reporting and scoring, decisioning technology, risk management, identity management, authentication and fraud detection services. Our consumer and commercial products are the primary source of revenue in each of the countries in which we operate and include credit reporting, decisioning tools and risk management services. We also provide information, technology and services to support talent management, as well as debt collections and recovery management. Additionally, we provide a variety of consumer and commercial marketing products generated from information databases, including business profile analysis, business prospect lists and database management. The countries in which we operate include Australia, New Zealand and India, as well as Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore through joint ventures.\nCanada.  \nSimilar to the USIS business units, our Canada operation offers products derived from the credit information that we maintain about individual consumers and businesses. We offer many products in Canada, including credit reporting, monitoring and scoring, consumer and commercial marketing, risk management, fraud detection and modeling services, identity management and authentication services, together with certain of our decisioning products that facilitate pre-approved offers of credit and automate a variety of credit decisions. We also offer credit monitoring products to resellers or directly to consumers, as well as commercial credit solutions, which help businesses manage financial and credit risk and gain insights on customers, markets and industry groups using our commercial data assets. We also provide data, technology and services to facilitate the search of land data and process real estate transactions in Canada.\n7\nCompetition\nThe market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change. Our competitors vary widely in size and in the nature of the products and services they offer. Sources of competition are numerous and include the following:\n•\nCompetition in the Verification Services business, for both the U.S. and key International segments of Australia, Canada and the U.K., is highly competitive with low barriers to entry and includes employers who manage verifications in-house, lenders who obtain verifications directly from employers, and numerous online and offline firms that provide verification services. Third parties may also seek to obtain verifications directly from employees by leveraging paper copies of information or by seeking employee credentials to access information systems. Competition in the U.S. Employer Services business is also highly competitive with low barriers to entry and includes in-house management of such services or the outsourcing of one or more of such services to numerous online and offline third-party outsourced providers; human resources consulting firms; human resources management services providers; payroll processors; accounting firms; and hundreds of smaller companies that provide one or multiple offerings that compete with our Employer Services business.\n•\nCompetition for our credit information solutions and direct-to-consumer solutions products varies by both application and industry, but generally includes global consumer credit reporting companies that offer a product suite similar to our credit information solutions, providers of personal identity theft protection services and providers offering free credit scores. There are also a large number of competitors who offer competing products in specialized areas (such as fraud prevention, risk management and application processing and decisioning solutions) and software companies offering credit modeling services or analytical tools. We believe our product provides the greatest value for customers given our decisioning technology and the features and functionality of our analytical capabilities. We emphasize our improved decision making and product quality while remaining competitive on price.\n•\nCompetition for our commercial solutions products primarily includes companies providing commercial credit reports, credit marketing and other business insights and analytics, including providers of these services in the international markets we serve. \n•\nCompetition for our debt collection and recovery management software, services and analytics is spread across a number of providers. We believe that the breadth and depth of our offering enables our clients to develop a more current and comprehensive view of consumers. In the category of platforms and analytics, we compete with entities that deploy collections platforms, account management systems or recovery solutions.  \nWhile we believe that none of our competitors offers the same mix of products and services as we do, we have strong competition in every category and certain competitors may have a larger share of particular geographic or product markets or operate in geographic areas where we do not currently have a presence.\nWe assess the principal competitive factors affecting our markets to include: our ability to protect information and systems; product attributes such as quality, depth, coverage, adaptability, scalability, interoperability, functionality and ease of use; product price; technical performance including system response time and availability; access to unique proprietary data tools; quickness of response, flexibility and client services and support; effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; existing market penetration; proprietary technology; and new product innovation.\nTechnology and Intellectual Property\n \nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect strategic or valuable intellectual property developed in connection with our business. We register, and apply for registration of, certain intellectual property in the U.S. and several foreign countries under applicable patent laws. We also register and rely on common law rights, where applicable, to protect trademarks, service marks, logos and internet domain names in the U.S. and in many foreign countries, the most important of which include “Equifax,” “The Work Number,” “Interconnect,” “Equifax Ignite,” and variations thereof. These marks are used in connection with many of our product lines and services. Our intellectual property rights are generally important to our operations and competitive position, but no single intellectual property right or group of intellectual property rights is solely responsible for protecting our businesses. Certain Company trademarks, including the “Equifax” trademark, contribute to the success of our business, and their loss could have a significant negative impact on us.\n \n8\nWe license other companies to use certain data, software and other technology and intellectual property rights we own or control, primarily as core components of our products and services, on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards and that are designed to protect our interest in our intellectual property. Other companies license us to use certain data, technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control. For example, we license credit-scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee. We do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations.\n \nGovernmental Regulation\n \nWe are subject to a number of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve consumer reporting, privacy and consumer protection, data protection, intellectual property, competition, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, employment, health, taxation or other subjects. In particular, we are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding the collection, protection, dissemination and use of personal information we collect, process or otherwise have in our possession. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n \nU.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws are enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate, and in some instances also through private civil litigation. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection that could affect us.\n \nSummary of U.S. Regulations Relating to Consumer and Data Protection\n \nOur U.S. operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations that govern the collection, protection and use of consumer credit and other information and impose penalties for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data. Many of these laws and regulations also affect our customers’ use of consumer credit or other data that we license. Examples of the most significant U.S. laws include, but are not limited to, the following:\nFederal Laws and Regulation\n•\nFCRA\n.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) regulates consumer reporting agencies, including many of our U.S. operations, as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports such as banks and other companies. FCRA provisions govern the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies (“CRAs”) that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating certain information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. Among other requirements, the FCRA limits the type of information that may be reported by CRAs, limits the distribution and use of consumer reports and establishes consumer rights to access, freeze and dispute information in the consumer's files. CRAs are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates and if a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information in the consumer’s file, to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) is the primary regulator that enforces and provides regulatory guidance related to the FCRA in the United States. CRAs are required to comply with regulations promulgated by the CFPB and are subject to regular supervisory engagements related to a variety of FCRA requirements. Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. The FCRA contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits against a CRA for violations of the FCRA. The United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state attorneys general may also enforce the requirements of the FCRA.\n•\nDodd-Frank Act. \n Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) created the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with examination and supervisory authority over CRAs, including us. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to consumer financial services practices and provides the CFPB with enforcement authority to enforce those provisions. Among other areas, the CFPB’s UDAAP authority extends to the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers. Allegations that we failed to safeguard or handle such data in a compliant manner may subject us to CFPB enforcement action. The CFPB may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce the laws and rules subject to its jurisdiction. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders, which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts, as well as other types of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary \n9\nviolations and up to $1 million per day for known violations. Also, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions in certain circumstances for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties).\n•\nFTC Act. \n The Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”) prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Under the FTC Act, the FTC’s jurisdiction includes the ability to bring enforcement actions based on the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers. Allegations that we failed to safeguard or handle such data in a reasonable manner may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action. There is no private right of action under the FTC Act.\n•\nGLBA.\n  The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), regulates, among other things, the use of non-public personal information of consumers that is held by financial institutions, including us. We are subject to various GLBA provisions, including rules relating to the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the physical, administrative and technological protection of non-public personal financial information. Breach of the GLBA can result in civil and/or criminal liability and sanctions by regulatory authorities. Regulatory enforcement of the GLBA is under the purview of the FTC, the CFPB, the federal prudential banking regulators, the SEC and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with each other.\n•\nCROA. \n The Credit Repair Organizations Act (“CROA”) regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing. There have been efforts to apply the CROA to credit monitoring services offered by CRAs and others. The CROA allows for a private right of action. Consumers can sue to recover the greater of the amount paid or actual damages, punitive damages, costs, and attorney’s fees for violations of the CROA.\nState Laws and Regulations Relating to Consumer and Data Protection\n \n•\nA number of states have enacted requirements similar to the federal FCRA. Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA, especially in connection with investigations and responses to reported inaccuracies in consumer reports. The FCRA preempts some of these state laws, but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts. The state of Vermont is grandfathered under the original FCRA requirements and thus we are subject to additional requirements to comply with Vermont law.\n•\nAll fifty states have adopted versions of data security breach laws that require notification to affected consumers and potentially regulators or law enforcement authorities in the event of a breach of personal information. A subset of these laws and other state laws require the implementation of data security measures as well. State attorneys general can enforce such state laws and can seek equitable as well as monetary remedies and in some cases private rights of action are permitted by such laws. \n•\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) has enacted extensive regulatory requirements applicable to CRAs that require registration with that agency, prohibit unfair and deceptive consumer practices and require compliance with significant portions of the NYDFS cybersecurity rules. \n•\nWe or certain of our operations are also subject to and affected by new and evolving state privacy and data security laws such as data broker registration requirements in California and Vermont, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, imposes additional data privacy requirements on many businesses operating in the state. The CCPA expansively defines “personal information” and imposes new notice requirements relating to the collection, use and sharing of personal information. It provides consumers with extensive rights, including the right to access the categories and specific pieces of personal information businesses collect, the right to request businesses delete information, and the right to opt-out of “sales” of personal information with sales being defined under the CCPA to include monetary and non-monetary valuable consideration. The CCPA also contains a private right of action in the event that a business suffers a security breach that was due to unreasonable security measures. We may also become subject to and affected by newly enacted state privacy laws similar to the CCPA, such as laws in effect in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia, as well as enacted laws in states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Tennessee that become effective throughout 2025 and 2026. A number of other state legislatures, including New York and Washington, have introduced comprehensive data privacy legislation modeled after, and which contain certain elements of, the CCPA, other state consumer privacy laws, or the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which is an extremely broad privacy law. \n10\nAdditional state legislatures are expected to consider similar legislation in 2025. If enacted, such laws may contain variations and impose new compliance risks and obligations on us. \n•\nState banking and financial services regulatory agencies have asserted either express or implied authority under applicable state laws to examine us as a third-party service provider to financial institutions, and in certain cases to bring enforcement actions against us. Generally, such examinations, and related enforcement actions, are focused on assessing our safety and soundness in support of financial institutions we serve. In 2018, we entered into a consent order with certain state banking regulators in response to their multi-state review of our information security program. This consent order obligated us to, among other things, make certain changes to our corporate governance and information security practices.\n•\nWe are also subject to federal and state laws that are generally applicable to any U.S. business with national or international operations, such as antitrust laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, state unfair or deceptive practices acts and various employment laws. We continuously monitor legislative and regulatory activities that involve credit reporting, data privacy, security and other relevant issues to identify issues in order to remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nSummary of International Regulations Relating to Consumer and Data Protection\n \nWe are subject to various data protection, privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we operate. Examples of the most significant of these laws include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nIn the U.K.\n, we are subject to a regulatory framework that provides for regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). The FCA focuses on consumer protection, the integrity of the U.K. financial system, and effective competition in the interests of consumers. The FCA has significant powers, including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products, to specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products, impose unlimited fines, and to investigate organizations and individuals. In addition, the FCA is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban; it has the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading, and to publish such decisions. Our core credit reporting and debt collections services and recovery management businesses in the U.K. are subject to FCA supervision. In addition to regulation by the FCA, we are also subject to regulation by the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office, which focuses on upholding information rights in the public interest and the protection of data privacy for individuals.\nIn the U.K., we are subject to provisions that are broadly equivalent to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (described below). These equivalent provisions were adopted into U.K. laws following the end of the transition period that followed the U.K.’s exit from the EU.\n•\nIn Europe\n, we are subject to the EU's GDPR, which is an extremely broad and sweeping privacy law. The GDPR establishes multiple privacy and data protection requirements that are more specific and comprehensive than those of the U.S. and most other countries where Equifax operates. In addition, the GDPR includes data breach notification requirements and it establishes the ability of regulators to pursue substantial penalties for non-compliance. In addition to the GDPR, each EU member state may include specific requirements regarding personal data breaches in its local data protection regulations. \n•\nIn Canada\n, federal and provincial laws govern how we collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of our commercial activities. Federally, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by organizations in the private sector. Businesses must follow the fair information principles set forth in PIPEDA to protect personal information, including: accountability, identifying purposes, consent, limiting collection, limiting use, disclosure and retention, accuracy, safeguards, openness, individual access and compliance. It sets out specific obligations with respect to accountability and identifying purposes, consent, collection, use, disclosure, retention, accuracy, safeguards, personal data breach reporting, individual access and compliance. Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec privacy legislation sets out similar privacy laws and rules that apply to our Canadian business. The federal and provincial privacy regulators have powers of investigation and intervention, and provisions of Canadian law regarding civil liability apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned. Canada also has specific credit reporting legislation that is regulated at a provincial level. At present, each province has credit reporting legislation, with the exception of the territories (Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut). Generally \n11\nspeaking, the legislation regulates the contents of credit files, the length of time information can be included on a credit file, who can receive credit reports and consumer rights pertaining to the maintenance of credit reports.\n•\nIn Latin America,\n data protection and credit reporting laws and regulations vary considerably among Latin American countries. Some countries, such as El Salvador, Paraguay, Chile and Honduras, establish a constitutional right to privacy without general data protection standards or a data protection authority. These countries, however, have laws that govern the functioning of credit bureaus. Other countries, such as Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico and most recently Brazil have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation similar to the EU's GDPR. The EU recognizes Argentina and Uruguay as having adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing.\n•\nIn Australia, \nwe are subject to regulatory oversight by various agencies. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (“OAIC”) is the regulator with direct responsibility for administering the Australian Privacy Principles (which relate to the collection, holding, use and disclosure of personal information) and Part IIIA of the Privacy Act 1988 (which regulates credit reporting). The OAIC can investigate a complaint, conduct its own investigations, resolve/make binding determinations and seek civil penalties. Our credit reporting business, Equifax Information Services and Solutions, is a member of an external dispute resolution scheme, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which has been approved by the OAIC to handle privacy and credit reporting complaints and make binding determinations. The OAIC can register codes of practice under the Privacy Act 1988, and has registered the Privacy (Credit Reporting) Code 2024. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) is the regulator responsible for administering and enforcing the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and related legislation concerning consumer protection and competition. The ACCC has the authority to use a range of actions to ensure compliance with the law, including investigative powers and the ability to seek penalties through litigation and other formal enforcement means.\n \nThe ACCC also administers Consumer Data Right legislation, which mandates the supply by banks of comprehensive credit information to credit reporting bodies, including Equifax. The Australian Retail Credit Association is a credit and credit reporting industry self-regulatory body, which administers principles and standards for the exchange of credit data between industry participants. Equifax Australasia Credit Ratings Pty Limited (formerly named Corporate Scorecard Pty Limited, one of our Australian subsidiaries) holds an Australia Financial Services License, which allows it to provide general advice to wholesale clients by issuing a credit rating, and has been approved in New Zealand as a rating agency by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand under section 86 of the Non-Bank Deposit Takers Act 2013 (NZ). The Australian Securities and Investments Commission regulates corporations and has authority to investigate, prosecute, ban individuals and to seek civil penalties. \n•\nIn New Zealand, \nthe regulatory framework provides for primary regulation under the Privacy Act 2020. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner (“OPC”) investigates complaints relating to the collection, use, holding and disclosure of personal information, both credit-related and non-credit related. The OPC can make a finding that there has been an interference with privacy but cannot impose civil penalties for this. In extreme cases where there has been an interference with privacy, it can refer these cases to the Director of Human Rights for determination in the Human Rights Review Tribunal. The OPC can issue practice codes under the Privacy Act 2020 and has issued and subsequently amended the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2020. The Privacy Act 2020 contains mandatory data breach reporting. The Retail Credit Association of New Zealand is an industry association which addresses reciprocity of data issues relating to comprehensive credit reporting and data standards.\n•\nIn India\n, various legislation including the Information Technology Act of 2000 and rules framed thereunder and the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act of 2005 and rules and regulations framed thereunder, establishes a federal data protection framework. Entities that collect and maintain personal data and/or credit information must ensure that it is complete, accurate and safeguarded, and must adopt certain privacy principles with respect to collecting, processing, preserving, sharing and using such data and/or credit information. India enacted a new privacy law, The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (\"DPDP Act\"), in August 2023. If it becomes effective, the DPDP Act would provide greater protection to individuals' personal data in digital form. The DPDP Act will become effective at a future date or dates to be determined by the Indian Central Government. In January 2025, the Central Government published draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025, which would supplement the DPDP Act. Our Indian business is also subject to regulation by the Reserve Bank of India, which is India’s central banking institution.\n12\nSummary of Regulations Affecting our Employer Services Business\n \nThe Employer Services business unit within our Workforce Solutions business segment helps employers comply with various regulatory frameworks applicable to employers in the United States. As a result, changes to those regulatory frameworks could impact the services we provide. For instance, if the federal government or a state government mandates the use of E-Verify or changes the requirements for individuals to work in the U.S., our I-9 service may be impacted. In addition, if the federal government changes the employer mandate or tax form requirements of the Affordable Care Act, our Affordable Care Act Management Service may be impacted. The Unemployment Cost Management service could be impacted if a state government changes the requirements for employers to process and/or protest unemployment claims. The Tax Management Services business within our Employer Services business is potentially impacted by changes in renewal or non-renewal of U.S. federal and state tax laws or interpretations, for example, those pertaining to work opportunity tax credits and unemployment compensation claims.\n \nHuman Resources\n \nOur People\nEquifax employed approximately 14,700 employees in 22 countries as of December 31, 2024. Our global employee base consisted of approximately 3,100 employees in our Workforce Solutions business unit, 2,500 employees in our USIS business unit, 4,500 employees in our International business unit and 4,600 employees in our corporate Centers of Excellence, which include our support centers in Chile, Costa Rica, India and Ireland. In 2024, we hired approximately 2,200 new employees and promoted approximately 1,900 employees as we continue to grow and transform our businesses around the world.\nForward-Looking Statements\n \nThis report contains information that may constitute “forward-looking statements.” Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will,” “may” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Equifax Inc. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section discusses the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for each of the periods presented.\nAs used herein, the terms Equifax, the Company, we, our and us refer to Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Equifax Inc.\n \nAll references to earnings per share data in MD&A are to diluted earnings per share, or EPS, unless otherwise noted. Diluted EPS is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding.\n \nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\n \nEquifax Inc. is a global data, analytics and technology company. We provide information solutions for businesses, governments and consumers, and we provide human resources business process automation and outsourcing services for employers. We have a large and diversified group of clients, including financial institutions, corporations, government agencies and individuals. Our services are based on comprehensive databases of consumer and business information derived from numerous sources including credit, financial assets, telecommunications and utility payments, employment, income, educational history, criminal justice data, healthcare professional licensure and sanctions, demographic and marketing data. We use advanced statistical techniques, machine learning and proprietary software tools to analyze available data to create customized insights, decision-making and process automation solutions and processing services for our clients. We are a leading provider of information and solutions used in payroll-related and human resource management business process services in the U.S., as well as e-commerce fraud and charge back protection services in North America. For consumers, we provide products and services to help people understand, manage and protect their personal information and make more informed financial decisions. Additionally, we also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management.\n \nWe currently operate in four global regions: North America (U.S. and Canada), Asia Pacific (Australia, New Zealand and India), Europe (the U.K., Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay). We maintain support operations in Chile, Costa Rica, India and Ireland. We also have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. \nRecent Events and Company Outlook\nAs further described above, we operate in the U.S., which represented 76% of our revenue in 2024, and internationally in 20 countries. Our products and services span a wide variety of vertical markets including financial services, mortgage, talent solutions, federal, state and local governments, automotive, telecommunications, e-commerce and many others.\nDemand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit and small business commercial credit decisioning and portfolio review, marketing, identity validation and fraud protection activity, employee hiring and onboarding activity, and activity in provisioning support services in the U.S. by government agencies. Demand is also enhanced by our initiatives to expand our products, capabilities and markets served. \nFor 2025, our planning assumes that U.S. economic activity, as measured by GDP, is expected to grow at a similar rate as experienced in 2024. We expect U.S. mortgage credit activity in 2025 to be below the levels of activity seen in 2024. The U.S. mortgage market, particularly the mortgage refinance portion of the U.S. mortgage market, can be significantly impacted by U.S. interest rates which impact mortgage rates available to consumers. In the international markets in which we operate, in particular in Australia, the U.K., and Canada, our planning also assumes economic activity, as measured by GDP, to grow in 2025 at similar rates as experienced in 2024. \n32\nSegment and Geographic Information\nSegments.  \nThe Workforce Solutions segment consists of the Verification Services and Employer Services business lines. Verification Services revenue is transaction-based and is derived primarily from employment and income verification, as well as criminal justice data and educational background data. Employer Services revenue is derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. These services include unemployment claims management, I-9 and onboarding services, Affordable Care Act compliance management, tax credits and incentives and other complementary employment-based transaction services. Workforce Solutions revenue is predominantly in the U.S., and they have also established operations in Canada, Australia and the U.K.\nThe USIS segment consists of three service lines: Online Information Solutions, Mortgage Solutions and Financial Marketing Services. Online Information Solutions and Mortgage Solutions revenue is principally transaction-based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer and commercial credit reporting and scoring, identity management, fraud detection, modeling services and consumer credit monitoring services. USIS also markets certain decisioning software services which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer and commercial credit-oriented decisions. Online Information Solutions also includes our U.S. consumer credit monitoring solutions business. Financial Marketing Services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit and consumer wealth information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross-selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk. \nThe International segment consists of Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada. Canada’s services are similar to our USIS offerings. Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America are made up of varying mixes of service lines that are generally consistent with those in our USIS reportable segment. We also provide information and technology services to support lenders and other creditors in the collections and recovery management process.\n  \nGeographic Information.  \nWe currently have operations in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Spain, the U.K., Uruguay and the U.S. We also have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. Approximately 76% and 77% of our revenue was generated in the U.S. during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSeasonality.\n \nWe experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. Revenue generated by the online consumer information services component of our USIS operating segment is typically the lowest during the first quarter, when consumer lending activity is at a seasonal low. Revenue generated from the Employer Services business unit within the Workforce Solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of 1095-C services that occur in the first quarter each year. Revenue generated from our financial wealth asset products and data management services in our Financial Marketing Services business is generally higher in the fourth quarter each year due to the significant portion of our annual renewals and deliveries which occur then. Mortgage related revenue is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year due to the increase in consumer home purchasing during the summer in the U.S. Any change in the U.S. mortgage market has a corresponding impact on revenue and operating profit for our business within the Workforce Solutions and USIS operating segments. \n \n33\nKey Performance Indicators.\n  Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. The key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nKey Performance Indicators\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except per share data)\nOperating revenue\n$\n5,681.1\n \n$\n5,265.2 \n$\n5,122.2 \nOperating revenue change\n8\n \n%\n3 \n%\n4 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n1,042.1\n \n$\n933.6 \n$\n1,056.0 \nOperating margin\n18.3\n \n%\n17.7 \n%\n20.6 \n%\nNet income attributable to Equifax\n$\n604.1\n \n$\n545.3 \n$\n696.2 \nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n4.84\n \n$\n4.40 \n$\n5.65 \nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,324.5\n \n$\n1,116.8 \n$\n757.1 \nCapital expenditures*\n$\n(495.9)\n$\n(585.8)\n$\n(617.4)\n*Amounts include accruals for capital expenditures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS —\nTWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022 \n \nConsolidated Financial Results\n \nOperating Revenue\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nChange\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nOperating Revenue\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\n(In millions)\nWorkforce Solutions\n$\n2,433.8\n \n$\n2,315.8 \n$\n2,325.4 \n$\n118.0\n \n5\n \n%\n$\n(9.6)\n— \n%\nU.S. Information Solutions\n1,893.0\n \n1,720.4 \n1,657.7 \n172.6\n \n10\n \n%\n62.7 \n4 \n%\nInternational\n1,354.3\n \n1,229.0 \n1,139.1 \n125.3\n \n10\n \n%\n89.9 \n8 \n%\nConsolidated operating revenue\n$\n5,681.1\n \n$\n5,265.2 \n$\n5,122.2 \n$\n415.9\n \n8\n \n%\n$\n143.0 \n3 \n%\n \nRevenue for 2024 increased 8% compared to 2023 due to revenue growth in USIS, International and Workforce Solutions. USIS revenue growth is primarily due to growth in mortgage related online services. International revenue growth is driven by growth in Latin America from the Boa Vista Serviços S.A. (\"BVS\") acquisition, completed in the third quarter of 2023, as well as local currency growth in Latin America, Europe and Canada. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is primarily due to growth in Verification Services, partially offset by declines in Employer Services. The effect of foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by $105.5 million, or 2%, in 2024 compared to 2023.\nRevenue for 2023 increased 3% compared to 2022 due to revenue growth in International and USIS. International revenue growth was driven by growth in Latin America primarily from the BVS acquisition, as well as growth in Canada, Europe and Asia Pacific. USIS revenue growth was primarily due to growth in online revenue, partially offset by declines in Mortgage Solutions. Workforce Solutions revenue declined slightly, as a decline in Verification Services revenue due to the impact of the decline in mortgage activity was principally offset by growth in Employer Services revenue. The effect of foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by $51.2 million, or 1%, in 2023 compared to 2022. \n34\nOperating Expenses\n \nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nOperating Expenses\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\n \n(In millions)\nConsolidated cost of services\n$\n2,518.7\n \n$\n2,335.1 \n$\n2,177.2 \n$\n183.6\n \n8\n \n%\n$\n157.9 \n7 \n%\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses\n1,450.5\n \n1,385.7 \n1,328.9 \n64.8\n \n5\n \n%\n56.8 \n4 \n%\nConsolidated depreciation and amortization expense\n669.8\n \n610.8 \n560.1 \n59.0\n \n10\n \n%\n50.7 \n9 \n%\nConsolidated operating expenses\n$\n4,639.0\n \n$\n4,331.6 \n$\n4,066.2 \n$\n307.4\n \n7\n \n%\n$\n265.4 \n7 \n%\n \nCost of Services.\n  Cost of services increased $183.6 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher royalty and revenue share costs, costs of purchased data and information, and costs from BVS, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased cost of services by $28.1 million.\nCost of services increased $157.9 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase is primarily due to higher royalty and revenue share costs, people costs, third party cloud usage fees and software costs, and costs of purchased data and information. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased cost of services by $16.9 million. \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\n  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64.8 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased people costs and costs from BVS, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The increased people costs, excluding the impact of costs from BVS, is primarily due to higher incentive plan costs. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $39.2 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $56.8 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in 2023 is primarily due to an increase in litigation expense, mainly due to a payment to the U.K. FCA for a penalty associated with resolution of the investigation of a material 2017 cybersecurity incident, as well as higher people costs, partially offset by lower discretionary expenses. The increase in people costs is primarily driven by higher incentive plan costs, partially offset by lower temporary labor. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $16.6 million.\n \nDepreciation and Amortization.\n  Depreciation and amortization expense for 2024 increased $59.0 million. The increase is primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs resulting from technology transformation capital spending incurred previously, as well as higher amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the BVS acquisition. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.9 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $50.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase is due to increased amortization of capitalized internal-use software and system costs from technology transformation capital spending incurred previously, as well as higher amortization of purchased intangible assets related to recent acquisitions.

At December 31, 2024, we had $169.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, as well as $1,212.1 million available to borrow under our Revolver. \nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe believe that our existing cash balance, liquidity available from our CP and Revolver, cash generated from ongoing operations and continued access to public or private debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. While there was no significant changes in our cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, we have utilized existing CP capacity, together with cash from operating activities, to meet our current obligations. As further described in our Financing Activities section below, during 2024 we issued $650.0 million of 4.8% Senior Notes, and we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our then-outstanding delayed draw term loan prior to the August 2026 maturity.\nFund Transfer Limitations.\n  The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to the U.S may be limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments. These restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. As of December 31, 2024, we held $166.0 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries.\nInformation about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nChange\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(In millions)\nOperating activities\n$\n1,324.5\n \n$\n1,116.8 \n$\n757.1 \n$\n207.7\n \n$\n359.7 \nInvesting activities\n$\n(511.5)\n$\n(878.2)\n$\n(959.5)\n$\n366.7\n \n$\n81.3 \nFinancing activities\n$\n(846.4)\n$\n(306.2)\n$\n273.7 \n$\n(540.2)\n$\n(579.9)\n \nOperating Activities\n \nCash provided by operating activities for 2024 increased $207.7 million compared to 2023 primarily due to changes in our working capital position and increased net income.\nCash provided by operating activities for 2023 increased $359.7 million compared to 2022 due primarily to the $345.0 million consumer class action settlement payment that was made in January 2022 related to the U.S. Consumer MDL Litigation settlement that became effective on January 11, 2022 that did not recur in 2023.\n \nInvesting Activities\nCapital Expenditures\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nChange\nNet cash used in:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(In millions)\nCapital expenditures*\n$\n(511.5)\n$\n(601.3)\n$\n(624.5)\n$\n89.8\n \n$\n23.2 \n*Amounts above are total cash outflows for capital expenditures.\n42\nOur capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, the licensing of certain software applications, investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements, and updating or expanding our office facilities.\nCapital expenditures decreased in 2024 and 2023 from 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to lower capitalized software costs and lower spending on technology infrastructure as compared to the prior year periods as we near completion of our technology transformation. \nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Investments\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nChange\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(In millions)\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\n$\n—\n \n$\n(283.8)\n$\n(433.8)\n$\n283.8\n \n$\n150.0 \nCash received from divestitures\n$\n—\n \n$\n6.9 \n$\n98.8 \n$\n(6.9)\n$\n(91.9)\n \n2024 Acquisitions and Investments. \nDuring 2024, we did not complete any acquisitions.\n2023 Acquisitions and Investments. \nDuring 2023, we acquired The Food Industry Credit Bureau and BVS within the International operating segment.

The decrease in net short-term borrowings in 2023 is due to higher repayments on short-term borrowings on our CP notes during the year as compared to 2022. \nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt in 2024 represent the issuance of $650.0 million of 4.8% Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2024. Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in 2023 represent $175.0 million of borrowings on our Revolver during the first quarter of 2023 and the issuance of $700.0 million of 5.1% Senior Notes in the second quarter of 2023. Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in 2022 represent the issuance of $750.0 million of 5.1% Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2022.\n43\nIn August 2024, we issued $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.8% five-year Senior Notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\") in an underwritten public offering. Interest on the 2029 Notes accrues at a rate of 4.8% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds of the sale of the 2029 Notes were ultimately used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our then-outstanding delayed draw term loan (the \"Term Loan\") prior to the August 2026 maturity. We must comply with various non-financial covenants, including certain limitations on mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions, as well as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The 2029 Notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\nIn May 2023, we issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.1% five-year Senior Notes due 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\") in an underwritten public offering. Interest on the 2028 Notes accrues at a rate of 5.1% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The net proceeds of the sale of the 2028 Notes were ultimately used to repay our then-outstanding $400.0 million 3.95% Senior Notes due June 2023 at maturity. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our CP program. We must comply with various non-financial covenants, including certain limitations on mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions, as well as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The 2028 Notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\nIn September 2022, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.1% five-year Senior Notes due 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") in an underwritten public offering. Interest on the 2027 Notes accrues at a rate of 5.1% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The net proceeds of the sale of the 2027 Notes were ultimately used to repay our then-outstanding $500.0 million 3.30% Senior Notes due December 2022. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our CP program. We must comply with various non-financial covenants, including certain limitations on mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions, as well as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The 2027 Notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\nPayments on long-term debt in 2024 represent repayment of our $750.0 million 2.60% Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2024 with cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings and $695.6 million of payments on our then-outstanding Term Loan during the third quarter of 2024. Payments on long-term debt in 2023 represent $175.0 million of repayments on our Revolver and repayment of our $400.0 million 3.95% Senior Notes during the second quarter of 2023. Payments on long-term debt in 2022 reflect the October 2022 repayment of the $500.0 million Senior Notes due December 2022 with the proceeds from the $750.0 million 5.1% Senior Notes issued in September 2022 and commercial paper borrowings. \nCredit Facility Availability.\n We have access to a $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver), which matures in August 2027. Borrowings under the Revolver may be used for working capital, for capital expenditures, to refinance existing debt, to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. The Revolver includes an option to request a maximum of three one-year extensions of the maturity date any time after the first anniversary of the closing date of the Revolver. In May 2024, we exercised our first option to extend the maturity date by one year, from August 2026 to August 2027, and amended the Revolver agreement to replace a discontinued reference rate for Canadian Dollar-denominated commitments. Availability of the Revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our CP notes and by any letters of credit issued under the Revolver.\nOur $1.5 billion CP program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of CP with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. We may use the proceeds of CP for general corporate purposes. The CP program is supported by our Revolver and the total amount of CP that may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our Revolver and by any letters of credit issued under the facility.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were $1.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver, and $286.5 million of outstanding CP notes. Availability under the Revolver was $1,212.1 million at December 31, 2024.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, approximately 94% of our debt was fixed-rate debt and 6% was variable-rate debt. Our variable-rate debt consists of outstanding amounts under our CP program. The interest rates reset periodically, depending on the terms of the respective financing agreements. At December 31, 2024, the interest rate on our variable-rate debt ranged from 4.55% to 4.81%.\nDebt Covenants.\n  A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our CP program and our Revolver, and could limit or, in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue CP. Our outstanding \n44\nindentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on mortgages, liens, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets.\nThe Revolver requires a maximum leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated EBITDA, of 3.75 to 1.0. We may also elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio by 0.5 to 1.0 (subject to a maximum leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.0) in connection with certain material acquisitions if we satisfy certain requirements. The Revolver also permits cash in excess of $175 million to be netted against debt in the calculation of the leverage ratio, subject to certain restrictions. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.\nWe do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt; however, our 2.6% senior notes due 2025, 3.25% senior notes due 2026, 5.1% senior notes due 2027, 5.1% senior notes due 2028, 4.8% senior notes due 2029, 3.1% senior notes due 2030, 2.35% senior notes due 2031 and 7.0% senior notes due 2037 (collectively, the “Senior Notes”) contain change in control provisions. If the Company experiences a change of control or publicly announces an intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the Senior Notes is lowered by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n \nCredit Ratings.\n  Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. \nA downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our CP program and our Revolver, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue CP. If our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. In addition, the market’s demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment. These ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change.\n For additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nEquity Transactions\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nChange\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(In millions)\nDividends paid to Equifax shareholders\n$\n(193.2)\n$\n(191.8)\n$\n(191.1)\n$\n(1.4)\n$\n(0.7)\nDistributions paid to noncontrolling interests\n$\n(4.6)\n$\n(45.6)\n$\n(3.1)\n$\n41.0\n \n$\n(42.5)\nProceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan\n$\n78.2\n \n$\n32.3 \n$\n16.9 \n$\n45.9\n \n$\n15.4 \n \nSources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n \n•\nWe did not repurchase any shares on the open market in 2024, 2023 or 2022. As of December 31, 2024, under the existing board authorization, the Company is approved for additional stock repurchases of $520.2 million.\n•\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we paid cash dividends to Equifax shareholders of $193.2 million, $191.8 million and $191.1 million, respectively, at $1.56 per share for 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n45\n•\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $4.6 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we paid distributions to noncontrolling interests of $45.6 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $3.1 million.\n•\nWe received cash of $78.2 million, $32.3 million, and $16.9 million during the first twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nWe anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends. The actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, results of operations, capital requirements, our financial condition and other relevant factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at current levels or at all.\nContractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Other Contingencies\nThe company's material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. Our plan is to use existing cash balances and funds generated by operating activities to fund our obligations and commitments. If our cash requirements exceed our existing cash balances and funds generated by operations, we will finance future cash requirements with existing borrowing capacity, as necessary. In the event that additional financing is needed, we would finance using the public and private corporate bond markets or syndicated loan markets, if available. The following sections provide details of material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding variable and fixed rate debt with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion, with $687.7 million payable within the next twelve months, as detailed further in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Future interest payments associated with the outstanding variable and fixed rate notes totals $964.6 million, with $209.0 million payable within the next twelve months.\nWe also issue unsecured promissory notes through our Revolver and CP program, with the Revolver set to expire in August 2027. As of December 31, 2024, we had no amount outstanding under our Revolver and $286.5 million outstanding under our CP program.\nData Processing, Outsourcing Agreements and Other Purchase Obligations\nWe utilize several outsourcing partners for services that we outsource associated with our network and security infrastructure, computer data processing operations, applications development, business continuity and recovery services, help desk service and desktop support functions, operation of our voice and data networks, maintenance and related functions and to provide certain other administrative and operational services. These agreements expire between 2025 and 2030. As of December 31, 2024 the estimated aggregate minimum contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately $1.4 billion, with $520.9 million payable within the next twelve months.\nPension, Post-Retirement and Deferred Compensation Obligations\nAs detailed further in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, we have several pension, post-retirement benefit and deferred compensation plans. Our U.S. Retirement Plan is frozen and is supported by plan assets to fund future payments. We have three supplemental retirement plans for certain key employees which are unfunded. As of December 31, 2024, the total gross obligation for the pension and post-retirement plans was $451.5 million, with $42.0 million of benefits expected to be paid within the next twelve months.\nWe maintain deferred compensation plans for certain management employees and the Board of Directors to defer the receipt of compensation until a later date based on the terms of the plan. As of December 31, 2024, the total obligation for the deferred compensation plans was $53.0 million, with $8.8 million expected to be paid within the next twelve months. These obligations exclude those under our deferred stock compensation plans.\nPayments to Resolve Certain Legal Proceedings and Investigations\nThe Company has made payments to resolve certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, described more fully in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this Form 10-K. Through 2024, the Company \n46\nhas made payments of $802.2 million for legal settlements related to a material cybersecurity incident in 2017. On January 11, 2022, the Consumer Settlement became effective, and on January 24, 2022, we deposited the $345.0 million remaining to be paid to the Consumer Restitution Fund. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) opened an enforcement investigation against our U.K. subsidiary, Equifax Limited, in October 2017 in connection with the 2017 cybersecurity incident. We received a notice with the FCA's findings on October 13, 2023, and paid a penalty of $13.5 million to resolve the matter.\nLeases\nAs detailed further in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, our lease arrangements principally involve office space. As of December 31, 2024, our total fixed lease payment obligations were $157.0 million, with $36.6 million payable within the next twelve months. \nOther Planned Uses of Capital\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, new product development, security and our technology, as well as continue to make strategic acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue in order to support growth in new product development and the completion of our technology transformation, although we expect spending related to capital expenditures for the next twelve months to be down from current levels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \nWe do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.\nLetters of Credit and Guarantees\n \nWe will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance or surety bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. The aggregate notional amount of all performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at December 31, 2024, and generally have a remaining maturity of one year or less. Guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. The maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at December 31, 2024.\n \nBenefit Plans\n \nWe sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the U.S. Retirement Income Plan (“USRIP”), that covers approximately 5% of current U.S. salaried employees who were hired on or before June 30, 2007, the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the USRIP was closed to new participation at December 31, 2008. This plan also covers retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status. \nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we made no voluntary contributions to the USRIP. At December 31, 2024, the USRIP met or exceeded ERISA’s minimum funding requirements. In the future, we expect to make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and our liquidity needs. We believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our CP program and our Revolver. \n \nFor our non-U.S. tax-qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. For our non-qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n \nFor additional information about our benefit plans, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nEffects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n \nInflation in the countries in which we operate may result in increases in the Company’s expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising U.S. interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the U.S. securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the \n47\nCompany’s financial position and profitability. Increases in U.S. interest rates may also negatively impact the U.S. mortgage market, which may adversely affect the Company’s revenue, financial position and profitability.\n \nA portion of the Company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. We generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments, hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n \nFor information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\n \nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n \nThe Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. This requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Income and Statements of Comprehensive Income. We also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\n \nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” we recognize revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and the customer obtains control of the good or service. In order to recognize revenue, we note that the two parties must have an agreement that creates enforceable rights, the performance obligations must be distinct and the transaction price can be determined. Our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transactional basis, in which distinct services are delivered over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services delivered. To measure our performance over time, the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised, with no rights of return once consumed. In these cases, revenue on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed. Additionally, multi-year contracts with defined pricing but an undefined quantity that utilize tier pricing would be defined as a series of distinct performance obligations satisfied over time utilizing the same method of measurement, the output method, with no rights of return once consumed. This measurement method is applied on a monthly basis resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed. \nAdditionally, we recognize revenue from subscription-based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period, generally one year. Revenue from subscription-based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided, using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are delivered. Any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period. Revenue from subscription-based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term. Multi-year subscription contracts are analyzed to determine the full contract transaction price over the term of the contract and the subsequent price is ratably recognized over the full term of the contract.\nRevenue is recorded net of sales taxes.\n48\nIf at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectability is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment from the customer. If there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of the performance obligation, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.\nCertain costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of a performance obligation are deferred as contract costs and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related goods and services. These costs generally consist of labor costs directly relating to the implementation and setup of the contract.\nContract Balances –\n The contract balances are generated when revenue recognized varies from billing in a given period. A contract asset is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes more revenue than what has been billed. As of December 31, 2024, the contract asset balance was $18.9 million. A contract liability is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed. Deferred revenue is recognized when we have an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and have already received consideration from the customer. We generally expect to recognize our deferred revenue as revenue within twelve months of being recorded based on the terms of the contracts.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually (as of December 1) and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance or trends, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have six reporting units, comprised of Workforce Solutions, USIS, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Europe and Canada.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our Workforce Solutions, USIS, Latin America, Europe and Canada reporting units. In this qualitative assessment, we considered the following items for each of the reporting units: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. In addition, for each of these reporting units, the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units. Based on these assessments, we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. As a result of our conclusions, no further testing was required for these reporting units.\nThe goodwill balance at December 31, 2024, for our six reporting units was as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nWorkforce Solutions\n$\n2,519.8 \nUSIS\n2,006.2 \nAsia Pacific\n1,260.5 \nLatin America\n494.9 \nEurope\n175.3 \nCanada\n91.1 \nTotal goodwill\n$\n6,547.8 \nValuation Techniques\n \nWe performed a quantitative assessment for our Asia Pacific reporting unit to determine whether impairment exists from the most recent valuation date due to the size of the cushion. In determining the fair value of the reporting unit, we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. We engaged a third party specialist to assist in developing these estimates and valuation approaches.\n \nUnder the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins for the reporting unit, \n49\ndiscount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital expenditures. The assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, for benchmark companies or guideline transactions. We believe the benchmark companies used for our Asia Pacific reporting unit serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks, participate in similar markets, provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly. The companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our discussion of Competition in Item 1 of this Form 10-K and have not significantly changed since our last annual impairment test. Valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit’s operating result with the comparable companies’ information. In addition to these financial considerations, qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple.\nGiven the lower historical cushion of concluded fair value in excess of carrying value for our Asia Pacific reporting unit, we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate our Asia Pacific reporting unit’s business enterprise value. The values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of the Asia Pacific reporting unit’s fair value. This approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70% of the value coming from the income approach. We believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations. The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value.\n \nWe have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of our last annual impairment test.\nThe estimated fair value of the Asia Pacific reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions. Impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value. The estimated fair value for all of our Asia Pacific reporting unit exceeded its related carrying value as of December 1, 2024. As a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded.\n \nGrowth Assumptions\nThe assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance, the details of which are described in our Management’s Discussion & Analysis of operating performance. Additionally, we consider the impact that known economic, industry and market trends, including the impact of rising interest rates and inflation, will have on our future forecasts, as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives, client service and retention standards, and cost management programs. At the end of the forecast period, the long-term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of our Asia Pacific reporting unit was between 3.0% and 5.0% based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as GDP, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve.\nWe projected revenue growth in 2025 for our Asia Pacific reporting unit in completing our 2024 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by this reporting unit. The anticipated revenue growth in this reporting unit, however, is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses and capital expenditures for the reporting unit, which reflects the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth and completion of our technology transformation initiatives.\nDiscount Rate Assumptions\nWe utilize a weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows for the reporting unit. We believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. To calculate the WACC, the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures. The cost of equity was computed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model which considers the risk-free interest rate, beta, equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit. The cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the reporting unit’s tax rate. For the 2024 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, the discount rate used to develop the estimated fair value of the Asia Pacific reporting unit was consistent with the discount rate used in 2023 and ranged between 10.0% and 11.5%.\n50\nEstimated Fair Value and Sensitivities\nThe estimated fair value of the Asia Pacific reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. For example, an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Due to the lower cushion when compared to other reporting units, Asia Pacific is more sensitive to changes in the assumptions noted above that could result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value. The excess of fair value over carrying value for the Asia Pacific reporting unit was greater than 10% as of December 1, 2024.\nGiven the relatively smaller excess of fair value over carrying value for the Asia Pacific reporting unit, we believe that it is at risk of a possible future goodwill impairment. The future impact of changes in economic conditions, including rising interest rates and inflation, remains uncertain. Avoidance of a future impairment will be dependent on continued growth during current economic conditions and our ability to execute on initiatives to grow revenue and operating margin and manage expenses prudently. We will continue to monitor the performance of this reporting unit to ensure no interim indications of possible impairment have occurred before our next annual goodwill impairment assessment in December 2025.\nLoss Contingencies\n \nWe are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. We determine whether to disclose and/or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable, probable, reasonably possible or remote.\nJudgments and uncertainties \n— We periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the estimated amount. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. Our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \n— We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material.\n \nIncome Taxes \n \nWe record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable.\nOur income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. We record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. We assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals.\nJudgments and uncertainties — \nWe consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. These judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes \n51\nin tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. At December 31, 2024, $42.9 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $15.8 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions — \nAlthough management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material.\n \nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions\nWe account for acquisitions under Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. We primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item Goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nJudgments and uncertainties\n — We consider accounting for business combinations critical because management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect our results of operations.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\n — Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets.",
