Business, Future Issues and Other Matters\n in MD&A and Notes 13 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, \nFuture Issues and Other Matters\n in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025 and Notes 13 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. There have been no updates to the matters discussed in \nFuture Issues and Other Matters\n in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, with the exception of the items described below.\n \nCVOW Commercial Project\nIn September 2019, Virginia Power filed applications with PJM for the CVOW Commercial Project and for certain approvals and rider recovery from the Virginia Commission in November 2021. The 2.6 GW project is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026 with an estimated total project cost of approximately $11.2 billion, excluding financing costs, that reflects an estimated impact of certain tariffs which became effective during 2025. The Companies’ projected impact of tariffs on expected total project cost is subject to change due to the inherent uncertainty associated with which tariffs, if any, may be in effect and the associated requirements and rates of such tariffs. Virginia Power’s estimate for the project’s projected levelized cost of energy, including renewable energy credits, is approximately $84/MWh, compared to the initial filing submission of $80-90/MWh.\nThe expected total project cost increase of $0.3 billion relative to Virginia Power’s August 2025 construction update filing with the Virginia Commission reflects current projections of tariffs on equipment expected to be delivered from March 2025 through the end of 2025 that originates from Mexico, Canada, a European Union member or other applicable countries and on equipment expected to be delivered from March 2025 through the end of 2026 that contains steel. The actual tariffs to be incurred are dependent upon the tariff requirements and rates, if any, at the time of delivery of the specific component. If the current tariffs were to remain in effect through the end of 2026, the expected project costs for offshore wind and onshore electrical\n \n\n\n \n78\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\ninterconnection equipment could increase by up to approximately $0.2 billion.\n \nThe estimated total project cost above reflects the Companies’ best estimate of the remaining construction costs, including contingency of approximately 7% on such remaining amounts. Such estimate could potentially change for items, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control, including but not limited to final network upgrade costs allocated by PJM, fuel for transportation and installation, the impact of applicable tariffs including any potential impact of pending Section 232 investigations and litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court, costs to maintain necessary permits, approvals and authorizations, ability of key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under existing contracts, marine wildlife and/or any severe weather events.\n \nVirginia Power commenced major onshore construction activities for the CVOW Commercial Project in November 2023 following the receipt of a record of decision from BOEM in October 2023 for construction. Onshore construction activities are anticipated to be completed in early 2026. Virginia Power commenced major offshore construction activities in May 2024 following the receipt of final approval from BOEM authorizing offshore construction and necessary permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for offshore construction in January 2024. Virginia Power completed the installation of all 176 monopiles in October 2025. Transition pieces began to be installed on monopiles near the end of 2024 with 63 transition pieces installed through October 2025 and the remaining 113 expected to be installed by early 2026. The first of three offshore substations was installed in March 2025. Deepwater export cables commenced being laid in late 2024 with the last of nine completed in July 2025. Of the 176 segments of interarray cable, expected to total 260 miles, 48 have been installed through October 2025 with the remaining to be laid throughout 2025 and 2026. Turbines are expected to commence installment in the fourth quarter of 2025 and be completed by the end of 2026.\n \nOffshore Wind Vessel Leasing Arrangement\nIn December 2020, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (most recently amended in August 2024) with a lessor to complete construction of and lease a Jones Act compliant offshore wind installation vessel. This vessel is designed to handle current turbine technologies as well as next generation turbines. The lessor provided equity and obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $715 million, which funded project costs. Including financing costs, total estimated project costs are approximately $715 million. In September 2025, the vessel was delivered and the five-year lease term commenced. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.\n\n\n \n79\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nITEM\n 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE\nDISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe matters discussed in this Item may contain “forward-looking statements” as described in the introductory paragraphs under Part I., Item 2. MD&A in this report. The reader’s attention is directed to those paragraphs for discussion of various risks and uncertainties that may impact the Companies.\nMarket Risk Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management\nThe Companies’ financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity securities prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in the Companies’ electric operations and Dominion Energy’s natural gas procurement and marketing operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt and future issuances of debt. In addition, the Companies are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities. The Companies’ exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is related to certain fixed price contracts associated with the CVOW Commercial Project which it manages through foreign currency exchange rate derivatives. The contracts include services denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for approximately €2.6 billion and 5.1 billion kr. In addition, certain of the fixed price contracts, approximately €0.7 billion, contain commodity indexing provisions linked to steel.\n \nThe following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a 10% change in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.\nCommodity Price Risk\nTo manage price risk, the Companies hold commodity-based derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products.\nThe derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and may include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices.\nA hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $18 million and a hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $18 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nA hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $72 million and $15 million in the fair value of Virginia Power’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nThe impact of a change in energy commodity prices on the Companies’ commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity-based financial derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Companies manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. For variable rate debt outstanding for Dominion Energy, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in an $11 million and $12 million decrease in earnings at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For variable rate debt outstanding for Virginia Power, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in a less than $1 million and $7 million decrease in earnings at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\n \nThe Companies also use interest rate derivatives, including forward-starting swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had $13.9 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding in combined absolute value of their long and short positions, except in the case of offsetting transactions, for which they represent the absolute value of the net volume of their long and short positions. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $456 million and $376 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at September 30, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had $10.8 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of these interest rate derivatives outstanding in combined absolute value of their long and short positions, except in the case of offsetting transactions, for which they represent the absolute value of the net volume of their long and short positions. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $157 million and $155 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2024.\n\n\n \n80\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nThe impact of a change in interest rates on the Companies’ interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Companies utilize foreign currency exchange rate swaps to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange risk associated with fixed price contracts related to the CVOW Commercial Project denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy had €894 million and €1.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency forward purchase agreements outstanding. A hypothetical 10% increase in the U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate would have resulted in a decrease of $72 million and $106 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s foreign currency swaps at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nThe impact of a change in exchange rates on the Companies’ foreign currency-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from foreign exchange derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.\nInvestment Price Risk\nThe Companies are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in the Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\nDominion Energy recognized net investment gains (losses) (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $854 million, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Dominion Energy recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized (losses) gains on debt investments of $52 million, $41 million and $(28) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively.\n \nVirginia Power recognized net investment gains (losses) (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $436 million, $526 million and $580 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Virginia Power recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains (losses) on debt investments of $23 million, $25 million and $(10) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively.\nDominion Energy sponsors pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Virginia Power employees participate in these plans. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are immediately recognized in earnings annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as well as whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement. A hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have a $28 million impact for the year ending December 31, 2025, and would have had a $31 million impact for the year ended December 31, 2024, to the expected returns on plan assets, respectively.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS\n AND PROCEDURES\nSenior management of both Dominion Energy and Virginia Power, including Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of each company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, each of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s CEO and CFO have concluded that each company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nThere were no changes that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Dominion Energy or Virginia Power’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n \n81\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPART II. \nOTHER \nINFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Companies are parties to various legal, environmental or other regulatory proceedings, including in the ordinary course of business. SEC regulations require disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Companies reasonably believe will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Companies use a threshold of $1 million for such proceedings.\nSee the following for discussions on various legal, environmental and other regulatory proceedings to which the Companies are a party, which information is incorporated herein by reference:\n•\nNotes 13 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \nFuture Issues and Other Matters\n in MD&A in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nNotes 13 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \nFuture Issues and Other Matters\n in MD&A in this report.",

These increases were partially offset by a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project sold to Stonepeak in October 2024, including impacts of charges for costs not expected to be recovered from customers, a decrease in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, an increase in charges associated with severe weather events, including storm damage and restoration costs, affecting Virginia Power and the closings of the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions.\n \nAnalysis of Consolidated Operations\nPresented below are selected amounts related

of operations follows:\nThird Quarter 2025 vs. 2024\nOperating revenue \nincreased 15%, primarily reflecting:\n•\nA $311 million net increase in fuel-related revenue as a result of an increase in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization;\n•\nA $237 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders;\n•\nA $48 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors;\n•\nA $45 million increase in non-fuel base rates associated with the settlement of the 2024 electric base rate case in South Carolina;\n•\nA $22 million increase due to the absence of one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review and the 2024 electric base rate case in South Carolina; and\n•\nA $21 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth.\n\n\n \n67\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n•\nA $91 million net decrease associated with market prices affecting Millstone, including economic hedging impacts of net realized and unrealized losses on freestanding derivatives ($115 million); and\n•\nA $68 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in cooling degree days.\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases \nincreased 47%, primarily due to higher commodity costs for electric utilities ($321 million) and an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits ($112 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\n \nOther operations and maintenance \ndecreased 6%, primarily due to a decrease in certain Virginia Power expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income ($25 million) and a decrease in outage costs, primarily at Millstone ($14 million).\nDepreciation and amortization\n increased 11%, primarily due to various projects being placed into service.\nImpairment of assets and other charges \nincreased 7%, primarily due to a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on 100% of the CVOW Commercial Project ($128 million), partially offset by the absence of a $55 million charge in connection with the 2024 electric base rate case in South Carolina primarily to write down certain materials and supplies inventory, the absence of a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs at Virginia Power ($30 million) and the absence of a charge for the impairment of certain nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities ($27 million).\nOther income \nincreased 24%, primarily due to an increase in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($94 million), partially offset by a decrease in non-service components of pension and other postretirement employee benefit plan credits ($36 million).\nInterest and related charges\n increased 30%, primarily due to unrealized losses in 2025 compared to unrealized gains in 2024 associated with freestanding derivatives ($81 million) and an increase in net issuances of long-term debt ($75 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($16 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, and the absence of charges incurred due to early debt repayments associated with the business review completed in March 2024 ($13 million).\nIncome tax expense\n increased 1%, primarily due to the absence of a benefit associated with the effective settlement of an uncertain tax position ($14 million), higher taxes on earnings within qualified decommissioning trusts ($13 million) and higher pre-tax income ($12 million), partially offset by an increase in renewable energy tax credits ($39 million).\t\nNet income from discontinued operations including noncontrolling interests\n increased $15 million, primarily due to the absence of a loss on the closing of the PSNC Transaction.\nNoncontrolling interests\n increased $22 million, due to the 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project sold to Stonepeak in October 2024, consisting of Stonepeak’s share of the earnings associated with the CVOW Commercial Project subsequent to closing, which includes a $64 million share of a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project.\nYear-To-Date 2025 vs. 2024\nOperating revenue \nincreased 12%, primarily reflecting:\n•\nA $586 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders;\n•\nA $236 million net increase in fuel-related revenue as a result of an increase in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers ($214 million), including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power effective March 2024 and an increase in commodity costs associated with sales to gas utility customers ($22 million);\n•\nA $150 million increase in non-fuel base rates associated with the settlement of the 2024 electric base rate case in South Carolina;\n•\nA $131 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors;\n•\nA $62 million net increase associated with market prices affecting Millstone, including economic hedging impacts of net realized and unrealized losses on freestanding derivatives ($103 million);\n•\nA $54 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;\n•\nA $40 million increase in transition service agreements primarily associated with the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions;\n•\nA $36 million increase associated with prices from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities at Virginia Power;\n•\nA $22 million increase due to the absence of one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review and the 2024 electric base rate case in South Carolina; and\n•\nA $12 million net increase in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to an increase in heating degree days during the heating season ($99 million), partially offset by a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($87 million).\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n•\nA $29 million decrease associated with severe weather events affecting Virginia Power; and\n•\nA $22 million net decrease associated with outages at Millstone attributable to the relative effects of a planned outage ($46 million), partially offset by fewer unplanned outages ($24 million).\n\n\n \n68\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases \nincreased 16%, primarily due to an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits ($227 million) and higher commodity costs for electric utilities ($218 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\nPurchased gas \nincreased 12%, primarily due to an increase in commodity costs for gas utility operations, which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\nOther operations and maintenance \nincreased 1%, primarily due to an increase in charges associated with severe weather events, including storm damage and restoration costs, affecting Virginia Power ($70 million), an increase in outage costs at Millstone ($37 million) and an increase in outside services ($23 million), partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the business review completed in March 2024 ($38 million) and a decrease in certain Virginia Power expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income ($34 million).\nDepreciation and amortization\n decreased 1%, primarily due to the absence of RGGI-related amortization ($182 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, partially offset by an increase due to various projects being placed into service ($128 million) and an increase in amortization associated with non-fuel riders ($24 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income.\nImpairment of assets and other charges \nincreased 3%, primarily due to a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on 100% of the CVOW Commercial Project ($224 million), partially offset by the absence of charges for the impairment of certain nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities ($60 million), the absence of a $55 million charge in connection with the 2024 electric base rate case in South Carolina primarily to write down certain materials and supplies inventory, the absence of a charge in connection with a settlement of an agreement ($47 million), the absence of a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs at Virginia Power ($30 million) and the absence of an impairment of a corporate office building ($17 million).\nOther income \nincreased 24%, primarily due to the absence of lower market-related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans ($334 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($36 million), partially offset by a decrease in non-service components of pension and other postretirement employee benefit plan credits ($103 million), a decrease in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($92 million) and a decrease in earnings from other investments ($21 million).\nInterest and related charges\n increased 4%, primarily due to an increase in net issuances of long-term debt ($134 million) and unrealized losses in 2025 compared to unrealized gains in 2024 associated with freestanding derivatives ($65 million), partially offset by variable rate debt repaid from proceeds associated with the business review completed in March 2024 ($69 million), the absence of charges incurred due to early debt repayments associated with the business review completed in March 2024 ($25 million), lower interest rates on commercial paper ($20 million) and decreased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($18 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income.\nIncome tax expense\n increased 13%, primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($197 million), partially offset by an increase in renewable energy tax credits ($125 million).\nNet income from discontinued operations including noncontrolling interests\n decreased $200 million, primarily due to the absence of earnings from operations following the closing of the Questar Gas Transaction ($184 million), PSNC Transaction ($138 million) and East Ohio Transaction ($82 million), the absence of a gain on the closing of the Questar Gas Transaction ($34 million) and the absence of a tax benefit associated with the Questar Gas Transaction ($25 million), partially offset by the absence of a loss on the closing of the East Ohio Transaction ($108 million), the absence of an impairment associated with the Questar Gas Transaction ($78 million), the absence of charges for employee benefit items related to the East Ohio Transaction ($33 million), the absence of a loss on the closing of the PSNC Transaction ($31 million) and the absence of tax expense associated with the PSNC Transaction ($16 million).\nNoncontrolling interests\n increased $122 million, due to the 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project sold to Stonepeak in October 2024, consisting of Stonepeak’s share of the earnings associated with the CVOW Commercial Project subsequent to closing, which includes a $112 million share of a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project.\nResults of Operations\n—\nVirginia Power\nPresented below is a summary of Virginia Power’s consolidated

of operations follows:\nThird Quarter 2025 vs. 2024\nOperating revenue\n increased 20%, primarily reflecting:\n•\nA $268 million net increase in fuel-related revenue as a result of an increase in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization;\n•\nA $237 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with non-fuel riders;\n•\nA $42 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors;\n•\nA $16 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;\n•\nA $15 million increase due to the absence of one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review; and\n•\nA $10 million increase associated with prices from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities.\n \nThese increases were partially offset by:\n•\nA $54 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in cooling degree days.\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases \nincreased 55%, primarily due to higher commodity costs for electric utilities ($278 million) and an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits ($112 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\nOther operations and maintenance\n increased 1%, primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative costs ($39 million) and an increase in outside services ($18 million), partially offset by a decrease in certain expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income ($25 million).\nDepreciation and amortization\n increased 11%, primarily due to an increase due to various projects being placed into service ($29 million) and an increase in amortization associated with non-fuel riders ($12 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income.\nOther taxes \nincreased 12%, primarily due to an increase in property taxes.\nImpairment of assets and other charges \nincreased $89 million, primarily due to a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on 100% of the CVOW Commercial Project ($128 million), partially offset by the absence of a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs ($30 million).\nOther income \nincreased 44%, primarily due to an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects.\nInterest and related charges \ndecreased 2%, primarily due to decreased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($16 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, partially offset by an increase in long-term debt borrowings ($22 million).\nNoncontrolling interests\n increased $22 million, due to the 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project sold to Stonepeak in October 2024, consisting of Stonepeak’s share of the earnings associated with the CVOW Commercial Project subsequent to closing, which includes a $64 million share of a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project.\nYear-To-Date 2025 vs. 2024\nOperating revenue\n increased 13%, primarily reflecting:\n•\nA $586 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with non-fuel riders;\n•\nA $223 million net increase in fuel-related revenue as a result of an increase in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other \n\n\n \n70\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nnegotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges effective March 2024;\n•\nA $116 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors;\n•\nA $45 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;\n•\nA $36 million increase associated with prices from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities;\n•\nA $15 million increase due to the absence of one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review; and\n•\nA $3 million net increase in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to an increase in heating degree days during the heating season ($73 million), partially offset by a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($70 million).\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n•\nA $29 million decrease associated with severe weather events.\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases \nincreased 22%, primarily due to an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits ($227 million) and higher commodity costs for electric utilities ($227 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\nOther operations and maintenance\n increased 7%, primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative costs ($109 million), an increase in charges associated with severe weather events, including storm damage and restoration costs ($70 million) and an increase in outside services ($33 million), partially offset by a decrease in certain expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income ($34 million) and a decrease in outage costs ($10 million).\nDepreciation and amortization\n decreased 4%, primarily due to the absence of RGGI-related amortization ($182 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, partially offset by an increase due to various projects being placed into service ($93 million) and an increase in amortization associated with non-fuel riders ($24 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income.\nOther taxes \nincreased 14%, primarily due to an increase in property taxes.\nImpairment of assets and other charges \nincreased $187 million, primarily due to a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on 100% of the CVOW Commercial Project ($224 million), partially offset by the absence of a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs ($30 million).\nOther income \nincreased 18%, primarily due to an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($44 million), partially offset by a decrease in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($15 million).\nInterest and related charges \nincreased 15%, primarily due to an increase in long-term debt borrowings ($76 million) and higher average outstanding principal on commercial paper and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy ($42 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($18 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income.\nIncome tax expense\n decreased 11%, primarily due to an increase in renewable energy tax credits.\nNoncontrolling interests\n increased $122 million, due to the 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project sold to Stonepeak in October 2024, consisting of Stonepeak’s share of the earnings associated with the CVOW Commercial Project subsequent to closing, which includes a $112 million share of a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project.\n \n\n\n \n71\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nSegment Results of

and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion Energy’s primary operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or in allocating resources. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for discussion of these items in more detail. Corporate and Other also includes items attributable to the Corporate and Other segment. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy reported an insignificant amount of specific items in the Corporate and Other segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, this primarily included $23 million after-tax loss for derivative mark-to-market changes.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, this primarily included a $57 million after-tax gain for derivative mark-to-market changes and $15 million net loss from discontinued operations, primarily associated with operations included in the PSNC Transaction, including the loss on sale. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this primarily included a $246 million after-tax loss associated with lower market-related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans, $200 million net income from discontinued operations, primarily associated with operations included in the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions, including the loss on sale associated with the East Ohio and PSNC Transactions, gain on sale associated with the Questar Gas Transaction, as well as an impairment charge associated with the Questar Gas Transaction, $30 million in after-tax costs associated with the business review completed in March 2024 and a $23 million after-tax gain for derivative mark-to-market changes.\nOutlook\nAs of September 30, 2025, there have been no material changes to Dominion Energy’s 2025 outlook as described in Item 7. MD&A in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. See \nFuture Issues and Other Matters \nfor a discussion of certain items that may have an impact on Dominion Energy’s 2025 net income on a per share basis.\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDominion Energy depends on both cash generated from operations and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term financings. Dominion Energy’s material cash requirements include capital and investment expenditures, repaying short-term and long-term debt obligations and paying dividends on its common and preferred stock.\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nPresented below are selected amounts related to Dominion Energy’s cash flows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, restricted cash and equivalents at\n   January 1\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n365\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n301\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flows provided by (used in):\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating activities\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,374\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,377\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9,501\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n293\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,828\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3,069\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet increase in cash, restricted cash and\n   equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n701\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,601\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, restricted cash and equivalents at\n   September 30\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,066\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,902\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nIncludes cash outflows of $55 million and $60 million for energy efficiency programs in Virginia for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $19 million for DSM programs in South Carolina for both the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by Dominion Energy’s operating activities decreased $3 million, inclusive of a $537 million decrease from discontinued operations. Net cash provided by continuing operations increased $534 million, primarily due to higher operating cash flows from electric utility operations driven by riders, customer usage and other factors ($1.1 billion) and settlements of interest rate swaps ($653 million), partially offset by lower deferred fuel and purchased gas cost\n \n\n\n \n74\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nrecoveries ($963 million) and a decrease from changes in working capital ($230 million).\nInvesting Cash Flows\nNet cash from Dominion Energy’s investing activities decreased $9.8 billion, primarily due to the absence of net proceeds from the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions in 2024 ($9.2 billion), an increase in plant construction and other property additions ($536 million) and the absence of distributions from equity method affiliates in 2024 ($126 million), partially offset by lower acquisitions of solar development projects ($190 million).\nFinancing Cash Flows\nNet cash from Dominion Energy’s financing activities increased $8.9 billion, primarily due to the absence of net repayments on 364-day term loan facilities in 2024 ($4.8 billion), an increase in net issuances of long-term debt ($3.8 billion), capital contributions from Stonepeak to OSWP ($1.1 billion), the absence of supplemental credit facility repayments in 2024 ($450 million) and the absence of the partial repurchase of Series B Preferred Stock in 2024 ($440 million), partially offset by a $1.4 billion decrease due to repayments of securitization bonds in 2025 which were issued in 2024, distributions from OSWP to Stonepeak ($167 million), a decrease in net issuances of short-term debt ($126 million) and impacts from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in OSWP ($88 million).\nCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt\n \nAs discussed in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy generally uses proceeds from short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, to satisfy short-term cash requirements not met through cash from operations. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending on the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. There have been no significant changes to Dominion Energy’s use of credit facilities and/or short-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nDominion Energy’s short-term financing is primarily supported by its joint revolving credit facility. In April 2025, Dominion Energy amended its joint revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the facility limit from $6.0 billion to $7.0 billion and extend the maturity date from June 2026 to April 2030. In addition, in April 2025, Dominion Energy entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement. At September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy had $5.9 billion of unused capacity under these revolving credit facilities. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for the balances of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding.\nDominion Energy Reliability Investment\nSM\n Program\nDominion Energy has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability Investment\nSM\n. The registration limits the principal amount that may be outstanding at any one time to $1.0 billion. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Dominion Energy or at the investor’s option at any time. At September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $451 million presented within short-term debt. The proceeds are used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.\nOther Facilities\nIn addition to the primary sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, from time to time Dominion Energy enters into separate supplementary credit facilities or term loans as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nLong-Term Debt\nSustainability Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn April 2025, the Sustainability Revolving Credit Agreement, which is described in Note 18 to the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, was amended to, among other things, increase the facility limit from $900 million to $1.0 billion and extend the maturity date from June 2025 to April 2028. At September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.\n \n\n\n \n75\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIssuances and Borrowings of Long-Term Debt\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy issued or borrowed the following long-term debt.

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.\n \nDominion Energy currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communication and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\n \nDominion Energy does not anticipate, excluding potential opportunistic financings, the issuance of any additional long-term debt in 2025.\nRepayments, Repurchases and Redemptions of Long-Term Debt\nDominion Energy may from time to time reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity or repurchases of debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.\n \nThe following long-term debt was repaid, repurchased or redeemed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\n\n\n \n\n\nType\n\n\n \n\n\nEntity\n\n\n \n\n\nPrincipal \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRate\n\n\n \n\n\nStated Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt scheduled to mature in 2025\n\n\n \n\n\nMultiple\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n830\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvarious\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly repurchases and redemptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal repayments, repurchases and redemptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n830\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nTotal amount redeemed prior to maturity, if any, includes remaining principal plus accrued interest.\n \nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for additional information regarding scheduled maturities of Dominion Energy’s long-term debt, including related average interest rates.\nRemarketing of Long-Term Debt\nIn September 2025, Virginia Power remarketed two series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of $222 million to new investors. Both series of bonds bear interest at a coupon of 3.125% until October 2030, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time.\nCredit Ratings\nAs discussed in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities. The credit ratings for Dominion Energy are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating organization. In May 2025, Moody’s affirmed its credit ratings but revised its outlook for Dominion Energy from stable to negative. As of September 30, 2025, there have been no other changes in Dominion Energy’s credit ratings from those described in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\n \n76\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFinancial Covenants\nAs discussed in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy is subject to various covenants present in the agreements underlying Dominion Energy’s debt. As of September 30, 2025, there have been no material changes to these covenants, nor any events of default under these covenants except the following changes. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report, Dominion Energy entered into an amended joint revolving credit facility as well as an amended Sustainability Revolving Credit Agreement. Within both agreements, the calculation of equity utilized in the total debt to total capital ratio was updated for a technical clarification. In addition, under the amended joint revolving credit facility, if Dominion Energy or any of its material subsidiaries failed to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $250 million, or $150 million for DESC, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion Energy’s joint revolving credit facility, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facility.\n \nAs discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report, in April 2025, Dominion Energy also entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement, which includes a maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio that is consistent with the allowed ratio under these two facilities.\n \nCommon Stock, Preferred Stock and Other Equity Securities\nIn the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, there is a discussion of Dominion Energy’s existing equity financing programs, including Dominion Energy Direct®. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy issued $105 million of stock through these programs, net of fees and commissions.\n \nDuring the first quarter of 2025, Dominion Energy entered into forward sale agreements under its May 2024 at-the-market program for approximately 8.8 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2025 at a weighted-average initial forward price of $55.34 per share. Including the forward sale agreements entered into from September through December 2024, Dominion Energy has entered into forward sale agreements for approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2025 at a weighted-average initial forward price of $56.62 per share. During the third quarter of 2025, Dominion Energy entered into forward sale agreements under its May 2024 at-the-market program for approximately 2.4 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled by the fourth quarter of 2027 at a weighted-average initial forward price of $59.91 per share.\n \nIn February 2025, Dominion Energy entered into a new at-the-market-program, and during the second quarter of 2025, Dominion Energy entered into forward sale agreements for approximately 11.0 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2026 at a weighted-average initial forward price of $55.83 per share. During the third quarter of 2025, Dominion Energy entered into forward sale agreements under its February 2025 at-the-market program for approximately 9.6 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled by the fourth quarter of 2027 at a weighted-average initial forward price of $61.11 per share. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.\n \nThrough September 30, 2025, Dominion Energy has not repurchased and does not plan to repurchase shares of common stock in 2025, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which does not impact the available capacity under its stock repurchase authorization. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.\nCapital Expenditures\nAs of September 30, 2025, there have been no material changes to Dominion Energy’s expectation for planned capital expenditures as disclosed in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDividends\nDominion Energy believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information regarding Dominion Energy’s outstanding preferred stock and associated dividend rate.\nSubsidiary Dividend Restrictions\nAs of September 30, 2025, there have been no material changes to the subsidiary dividend restrictions disclosed in the \nSubsidiary Dividend Restrictions \nsection of MD&A in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nCollateral and Credit Risk\nCollateral requirements are impacted by capital projects, commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. As of September 30, 2025, there have been no material changes to the collateral requirements disclosed in the \nCollateral and Credit Risk \nsection of MD&A in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\n \n77\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nDominion Energy’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion Energy’s credit exposure at September 30, 2025 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGross Credit\nExposure\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCredit\nCollateral\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNet Credit\nExposure\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment grade\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-investment grade\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo external ratings:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternally rated—investment grade\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternally rated—non-investment grade\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n(5)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n105\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n103\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nDesignations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.

Dominion Energy expects current liabilities to be paid within the next twelve months. In addition to the items already discussed, the following represent material expected cash requirements recorded on Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2025. Such obligations include:\n•\nOperating and finance lease obligations – See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024;\n•\nRegulatory liabilities – See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report; \n•\nAROs – See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; \n•\nEmployee benefit plan obligations – See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn addition, Dominion Energy is party to contracts and arrangements which may require it to make material cash payments in future years that are not recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such obligations include:\n \n•\nGuarantees – See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nFuture Issues and Other Matters\nSee \nItem 1. Business, Future Issues and Other Matters\n in MD&A and Notes 13 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, \nFuture Issues and Other Matters\n in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025 and Notes 13 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. There have been no updates to the matters discussed in \nFuture Issues and Other Matters\n in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, with the exception of the items described below.\n \nCVOW Commercial Project\nIn September 2019, Virginia Power filed applications with PJM for the CVOW Commercial Project and for certain approvals and rider recovery from the Virginia Commission in November 2021. The 2.6 GW project is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026 with an estimated total project cost of approximately $11.2 billion, excluding financing costs, that reflects an estimated impact of certain tariffs which became effective during 2025. The Companies’ projected impact of tariffs on expected total project cost is subject to change due to the inherent uncertainty associated with which tariffs, if any, may be in effect and the associated requirements and rates of such tariffs. Virginia Power’s estimate for the project’s projected levelized cost of energy, including renewable energy credits, is approximately $84/MWh, compared to the initial filing submission of $80-90/MWh.\nThe expected total project cost increase of $0.3 billion relative to Virginia Power’s August 2025 construction update filing with the Virginia Commission reflects current projections of tariffs on equipment expected to be delivered from March 2025 through the end of 2025 that originates from Mexico, Canada, a European Union member or other applicable countries and on equipment expected to be delivered from March 2025 through the end of 2026 that contains steel. The actual tariffs to be incurred are dependent upon the tariff requirements and rates, if any, at the time of delivery of the specific component. If the current tariffs were to remain in effect through the end of 2026, the expected project costs for offshore wind and onshore electrical\n \n\n\n \n78\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\ninterconnection equipment could increase by up to approximately $0.2 billion.\n \nThe estimated total project cost above reflects the Companies’ best estimate of the remaining construction costs, including contingency of approximately 7% on such remaining amounts. Such estimate could potentially change for items, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control, including but not limited to final network upgrade costs allocated by PJM, fuel for transportation and installation, the impact of applicable tariffs including any potential impact of pending Section 232 investigations and litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court, costs to maintain necessary permits, approvals and authorizations, ability of key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under existing contracts, marine wildlife and/or any severe weather events.\n \nVirginia Power commenced major onshore construction activities for the CVOW Commercial Project in November 2023 following the receipt of a record of decision from BOEM in October 2023 for construction. Onshore construction activities are anticipated to be completed in early 2026. Virginia Power commenced major offshore construction activities in May 2024 following the receipt of final approval from BOEM authorizing offshore construction and necessary permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for offshore construction in January 2024. Virginia Power completed the installation of all 176 monopiles in October 2025. Transition pieces began to be installed on monopiles near the end of 2024 with 63 transition pieces installed through October 2025 and the remaining 113 expected to be installed by early 2026. The first of three offshore substations was installed in March 2025. Deepwater export cables commenced being laid in late 2024 with the last of nine completed in July 2025. Of the 176 segments of interarray cable, expected to total 260 miles, 48 have been installed through October 2025 with the remaining to be laid throughout 2025 and 2026. Turbines are expected to commence installment in the fourth quarter of 2025 and be completed by the end of 2026.\n \nOffshore Wind Vessel Leasing Arrangement\nIn December 2020, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (most recently amended in August 2024) with a lessor to complete construction of and lease a Jones Act compliant offshore wind installation vessel. This vessel is designed to handle current turbine technologies as well as next generation turbines. The lessor provided equity and obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $715 million, which funded project costs. Including financing costs, total estimated project costs are approximately $715 million. In September 2025, the vessel was delivered and the five-year lease term commenced. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.\n\n\n \n79"
