Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAcquisition of UScellular Wireless Business\nTransaction Overview\nOn May 24, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with United States Cellular Corporation (“UScellular”), Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC for the acquisition of substantially all of UScellular’s wireless operations and select AWS, PCS, 600 MHz, 700 MHz and other spectrum assets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.4 billion, payable in cash and the assumption of up to $2.0 billion of debt through exchange offers to certain UScellular debtholders. \nOn May 23, 2025, we launched exchange offers (the “Exchange Offers”) for any and all of certain outstanding senior notes of UScellular for new notes of T-Mobile with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity dates and redemption terms as each corresponding series of senior notes of UScellular. In conjunction with the Exchange Offers, we also solicited consents for each series of the outstanding senior notes of UScellular to effect a number of amendments to the applicable indenture under which each such series of notes were issued and are governed (the “Consent Solicitations”). The consummation of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations were subject to the closing of the UScellular acquisition, which occurred on August 1, 2025. \n41\nTable of Contents\nOn July 22, 2025, we entered into asset purchase agreements for the acquisition of substantially all of the wireless operations assets (together with UScellular’s wireless operations and select spectrum assets, the “UScellular Wireless Business”) of each of Farmers Cellular Telephone Company, Inc., Iowa RSA No. 9 Limited Partnership, and Iowa RSA No. 12 Limited Partnership (collectively, the “Iowa Entities”) for an aggregate purchase price of $175 million payable in cash. Prior to our acquisition of the Iowa Entities, UScellular held a minority interest in each of the Iowa Entities.\nThe UScellular Wireless Business offers a comprehensive range of wireless communications products and services. As a combined company, we expect to increase competition in the U.S. wireless and broadband industries, achieve synergies and enhance our rural 5G coverage with our combined network footprint. Following the closing of the transactions, UScellular and the Iowa Entities will retain ownership of their other spectrum licenses, as well as their towers.\nOn August 1, 2025, upon the completion of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals (the “UScellular Acquisition Date”), we completed the acquisition of the UScellular Wireless Business (the “UScellular Acquisition”), and as a result, the UScellular Wireless Business became wholly owned by T-Mobile. In exchange, on the UScellular Acquisition Date, we transferred cash of $2.8 billion. Additionally, the closing of the UScellular Acquisition obligated us to execute the Exchange Offers. On August 5, 2025, we executed the Exchange Offers of certain senior notes of UScellular with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.7 billion for T-Mobile notes with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity dates and redemption terms as each corresponding series of senior notes of UScellular. \nFor more information regarding the UScellular Acquisition, see \nNote 2 – Business Combinations\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUScellular Merger-Related Costs\nUScellular merger-related costs associated with the UScellular Acquisition to date include:\n•\nIntegration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations and migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and billing systems;\n•\nRestructuring costs, including severance and network decommissioning; and\n•\nTransaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the UScellular Acquisition.\nUScellular merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See “Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA” in the “\nPerformance Measures\n” section of this MD&A. Net cash payments for UScellular merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in Net cash provided by operating activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and our calculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\nUScellular merger-related costs are presented below:\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n% \nUScellular merger-related costs\nCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n$\n7 \n$\n— \n$\n7 \nNM\n$\n7 \n$\n— \n$\n7 \nNM\nCost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n2 \n— \n2 \nNM\n2 \n— \n2 \nNM\nSelling, general and administrative\n64 \n16 \n48 \n300 \n%\n111 \n16 \n95 \n594 \n%\nTotal UScellular merger-related costs\n$\n73 \n$\n16 \n$\n57 \n356 \n%\n$\n120 \n$\n16 \n$\n104 \n650 \n%\nNet cash payments for UScellular merger-related costs\n$\n42 \n$\n8 \n$\n34 \n425 \n%\n$\n82 \n$\n8 \n$\n74 \n925 \n%\nNM - Not meaningful\n42\nTable of Contents\nAnticipated Impacts\nOur UScellular Acquisition restructuring and integration activities are expected to occur over the next two years with substantially all costs incurred and associated cash payments made by the end of fiscal year 2027. We are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives associated with the UScellular Acquisition, which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the costs and related payments.\nAs a result of our ongoing restructuring and integration activities, we expect to realize cost efficiencies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network as well as other business processes and operations. Upon completion of these activities, we expect to achieve total annual run rate cost synergies of $1.2 billion, consisting of $950 million in operating expenses and $250 million in capital expenditures.\nAcquisition of Vistar Media Inc. \nOn December 20, 2024, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Vistar Media Inc. (“Vistar”), a provider of technology solutions for digital-out-of-home advertisements (the “Vistar Acquisition”). \nUpon the completion of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, on February 3, 2025 (the “Vistar Acquisition Date”), we completed the Vistar Acquisition, and as a result, Vistar became a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile. In exchange, we transferred cash of $621 million. \nFor more information regarding the Vistar Acquisition, see \nNote 2 – Business Combinations\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of Blis Holdco Limited\nOn February 18, 2025, we entered into a share purchase agreement for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Blis Holdco Limited (“Blis”), a provider of advertising solutions (the “Blis Acquisition”). \nUpon the completion of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, on March 3, 2025 (the “Blis Acquisition Date”), we completed the Blis Acquisition, and as a result, Blis became a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile. In exchange, we transferred cash of $180 million. \nFor more information regarding the Blis Acquisition, see \nNote 2 – Business Combinations\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of Ka’ena Corporation\nOn May 1, 2024 (the “Ka’ena Acquisition Date”), we completed the merger with Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, among others, Mint Mobile LLC (collectively, “Ka’ena”), and as a result, Ka’ena became a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile (the “Ka’ena Acquisition”). The total purchase price consists of an upfront payment on the Ka’ena Acquisition Date and an earnout payable in the third quarter of 2026. On the Ka’ena Acquisition Date, and in satisfaction of the upfront payment, we transferred $420 million in cash and 3,264,952 shares of T-Mobile common stock valued at $536 million as determined based on its closing market price on April 30, 2024, for a total payment fair value of $956 million. A portion of the upfront payment made on the Ka’ena Acquisition Date was for the settlement of the preexisting wholesale relationship with Ka’ena. The amount of the upfront payment was subject to customary adjustments, and as a result of such adjustments, $17 million of the upfront payment was returned to T-Mobile during the fourth quarter of 2024, which resulted in a commensurate increase in the maximum payable in satisfaction of the earnout.\nBased on the adjusted amount paid upfront, an additional $420 million in future cash and T-Mobile common stock is payable in satisfaction of the earnout.\nPrior to the Ka’ena Acquisition, Ka’ena was a wholesale partner of the Company for which we recognized service revenues within Wholesale and other service revenues. Upon the closing of the Ka’ena Acquisition, this relationship was effectively terminated, and the Company acquired Ka’ena’s prepaid customer relationships and began to recognize service revenues associated with these customers within Prepaid revenues and operating expenses primarily within Selling, general and \n43\nTable of Contents\nadministrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income subsequent to the Ka’ena Acquisition Date.\nFor more information regarding the Ka’ena Acquisition, see \nNote 2 – Business Combinations\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSprint Merger-Related Costs\nAs of June 30, 2024, we have incurred substantially all restructuring and integration costs associated with our merger (the “Sprint Merger”) with Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”) and, accordingly, no longer separately disclose Sprint Merger-related costs. The cash payments for the Sprint Merger-related costs incurred extend beyond 2025 and primarily relate to operating leases for which we have recognized accelerated lease expense. \nSprint Merger-related costs were excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See “Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA” in the “\nPerformance Measures\n” section of this MD&A.\nJoint Ventures\nOn April 24, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with a fund operated by EQT, EQT Infrastructure VI (“Fund VI”), to establish a joint venture between us and Fund VI to acquire Lumos (“Lumos”), a fiber-to-the-home platform, from EQT’s predecessor fund, EQT Infrastructure III. On April 1, 2025, we completed the joint acquisition of Lumos, upon the completion of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. During the three months ended June 30, 2025, we invested $932 million to acquire a 50% equity interest in the joint venture and 97,000 fiber customers. The funds invested by us will be used by the joint venture to fund future fiber builds. In addition, pursuant to the definitive agreement, we expect to make an additional capital contribution of approximately $500 million between 2027 and 2028 under the existing business plan. Following the joint acquisition, Lumos transitioned to a wholesale model where we are the anchor tenant owning residential and small business customer relationships. \nOn July 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with KKR & Co. Inc. to establish a joint venture to acquire Metronet Holdings, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Metronet”), a fiber-to-the-home platform. On July 24, 2025, we completed the joint acquisition of Metronet upon the completion of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we invested $4.6 billion to acquire a 50% equity interest in the joint venture and 713,000 residential fiber customers. Following the joint acquisition, Metronet became a wholesale services provider, and its residential fiber retail operations and customers transitioned to us. We do not anticipate making further capital contributions under the existing business plan. \nWe account for the Lumos and Metronet joint ventures under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of earnings presented within Other (expense) income, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We recognize revenues for fiber customers and the related wholesale costs paid to the joint ventures for network access within Postpaid revenues and Cost of services, respectively, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. \nThe joint ventures will focus on market identification and selection, build plans, network engineering and design, network deployment and customer installation, with us owning customer relationships and selling fiber service under the T-Mobile brand. \nFor more information regarding the Lumos and Metronet joint ventures, see \nNote 3 – Joint Ventures\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\nOn July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”) into law. The OBBBA includes numerous changes to existing tax law, including provisions providing current deductibility of certain property additions, limitations on interest deductions based on a tax EBITDA framework, and current deductibility of domestic research and development costs. These provisions are generally effective beginning in 2025, and we currently anticipate they will partially defer our income tax payments in future years and will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Management continues to review the OBBBA tax provisions to assess impacts to our consolidated financial statements.\n44\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nSet forth below is a summary of our consolidated financial results:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nRevenues\nPostpaid revenues\n$\n14,882 \n$\n13,308 \n$\n1,574 \n12 \n%\n$\n42,554 \n$\n38,838 \n$\n3,716 \n10 \n%\nPrepaid revenues\n2,625 \n2,716 \n(91)\n(3)\n%\n7,911 \n7,711 \n200 \n3 \n%\nWholesale and other service revenues\n734 \n701 \n33 \n5 \n%\n2,139 \n2,701 \n(562)\n(21)\n%\nTotal service revenues\n18,241 \n16,725 \n1,516 \n9 \n%\n52,604 \n49,250 \n3,354 \n7 \n%\nEquipment revenues\n3,465 \n3,207 \n258 \n8 \n%\n10,608 \n9,564 \n1,044 \n11 \n%\nOther revenues\n251 \n230 \n21 \n9 \n%\n763 \n714 \n49 \n7 \n%\nTotal revenues\n21,957 \n20,162 \n1,795 \n9 \n%\n63,975 \n59,528 \n4,447 \n7 \n%\nOperating expenses\nCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below\n2,873 \n2,722 \n151 \n6 \n%\n8,192 \n8,074 \n118 \n1 \n%\nCost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below\n4,853 \n4,307 \n546 \n13 \n%\n14,310 \n12,794 \n1,516 \n12 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n6,015 \n5,186 \n829 \n16 \n%\n16,900 \n15,466 \n1,434 \n9 \n%\nImpairment expense\n278 \n— \n278 \nNM\n278 \n— \n278 \nNM\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,408 \n3,151 \n257 \n8 \n%\n9,752 \n9,770 \n(18)\n— \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n17,427 \n15,366 \n2,061 \n13 \n%\n49,432 \n46,104 \n3,328 \n7 \n%\nOperating income\n4,530 \n4,796 \n(266)\n(6)\n%\n14,543 \n13,424 \n1,119 \n8 \n%\nOther expense, net\nInterest expense, net\n(924)\n(836)\n(88)\n11 \n%\n(2,762)\n(2,570)\n(192)\n7 \n%\nOther (expense) income, net\n(78)\n7 \n(85)\nNM\n(135)\n19 \n(154)\n(811)\n%\nTotal other expense, net\n(1,002)\n(829)\n(173)\n21 \n%\n(2,897)\n(2,551)\n(346)\n14 \n%\nIncome before income taxes\n3,528 \n3,967 \n(439)\n(11)\n%\n11,646 \n10,873 \n773 \n7 \n%\nIncome tax expense\n(814)\n(908)\n94 \n(10)\n%\n(2,757)\n(2,515)\n(242)\n10 \n%\nNet income\n$\n2,714 \n$\n3,059 \n$\n(345)\n(11)\n%\n$\n8,889 \n$\n8,358 \n$\n531 \n6 \n%\nStatement of Cash Flows Data\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n7,457 \n$\n6,139 \n$\n1,318 \n21 \n%\n$\n21,296 \n$\n16,744 \n$\n4,552 \n27 \n%\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(10,139)\n(3,307)\n(6,832)\n207 \n%\n(15,107)\n(6,772)\n(8,335)\n123 \n%\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(4,238)\n507 \n(4,745)\n(936)\n%\n(8,250)\n(5,293)\n(2,957)\n56 \n%\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,684 \n$\n8,243 \n$\n441 \n5 \n%\n$\n25,490 \n$\n23,948 \n$\n1,542 \n6 \n%\nCore Adjusted EBITDA\n8,680 \n8,222 \n458 \n6 \n%\n25,479 \n23,866 \n1,613 \n7 \n%\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n4,818 \n5,162 \n(344)\n(7)\n%\n13,810 \n12,948 \n862 \n7 \n%\nNM - Not meaningful\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following discussion and analysis is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, unless otherwise stated.\nTotal revenues \nincreased $1.8 billion, or 9%, for the three months ended and increased $4.4 billion, or 7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The components of these changes are discussed below.\nPostpaid revenues \nincreased $1.6 billion, or 12%, for the three months ended and\n \nincreased $3.7 billion, or 10%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily from:\n•\nHigher average postpaid accounts, including following the acquisitions of UScellular, Metronet and Lumos; and\n•\nHigher postpaid ARPA.

The number of customers whose service was deactivated is presented net of customers that subsequently had their service restored within a certain period of time and excludes customers who received service for less than a certain minimum period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.\nThe following table sets forth the churn:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPostpaid phone churn\n0.89 \n%\n0.86 \n%\n3 bps\n0.90 \n%\n0.84 \n%\n6 bps\nPrepaid churn\n2.77 \n%\n2.78 \n%\n-1 bps\n2.70 \n%\n2.69 \n%\n1 bps\nPostpaid phone churn increased 3 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to higher industry switching.\nPostpaid phone churn increased 6 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to higher industry switching and from the temporary impact of current year rate plan optimizations.\nPrepaid churn decreased slightly for the three months ended and increased slightly for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nPostpaid Average Revenue Per Account\nPostpaid Average Revenue per Account (“ARPA”) represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. Postpaid ARPA is calculated as Postpaid revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of postpaid \n53\nTable of Contents\naccounts during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assists in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including 5G broadband, fiber, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT).\nThe following table sets forth our operating measure ARPA:\n(in dollars)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nPostpaid ARPA\n$\n149.44 \n$\n145.60 \n$\n3.84 \n3 \n%\n$\n148.54 \n$\n143.02 \n$\n5.52 \n4 \n%\nPostpaid ARPA increased $3.84, or 3%, for the three months ended and increased $5.52, or 4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily from:\n•\nThe positive impact from rate plan optimizations and higher fee revenue, including from the adoption of new tax and fee exclusive plans;\n•\nAn increase in customers per account, including from the continued adoption of 5G broadband and continued growth of T-Mobile for Business customers, partially offset by fiber and UScellular accounts with fewer customers per account;\n•\nHigher premium services, primarily high-end rate plans, net of contra revenues for content included in such plans, and discounts for specific affinity groups, such as 55+, military and first responders; partially offset by\n•\nIncreased promotional activity, including the success of bundled offerings.\nAverage Revenue Per User\nAverage Revenue per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned per customer. ARPU is calculated as service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include 5G broadband, fiber, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT).\nThe following table sets forth our operating measure ARPU:\n(in dollars)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nPostpaid phone ARPU\n$\n50.71 \n$\n49.79 \n$\n0.92 \n2 \n%\n$\n50.25 \n$\n49.22 \n$\n1.03 \n2 \n%\nPrepaid ARPU\n33.93 \n35.81 \n(1.88)\n(5)\n%\n34.41 \n36.27 \n(1.86)\n(5)\n%\nPostpaid Phone ARPU\nPostpaid phone ARPU increased $0.92, or 2%, for the three months ended and increased $1.03, or 2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily from:\n•\nThe positive impact from rate plan optimizations and higher fee revenue, including from the adoption of new tax and fee exclusive plans;\n•\nHigher premium services, primarily high-end rate plans, net of contra revenues for content included in such plans, and discounts for specific affinity groups, such as 55+, military and first responders; partially offset by continued growth in T-Mobile for Business customers with lower ARPU given larger account sizes; and\n•\nThe impact of customers acquired in the UScellular Acquisition, which have higher ARPU; partially offset by\n•\nIncreased promotional activity, including the success of bundled offerings.\n54\nTable of Contents\nPrepaid ARPU\nPrepaid ARPU decreased $1.88, or 5%, for the three months ended and decreased $1.86, or 5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nThe decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily from dilution from promotional activity and rate plan mix.\nThe decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily from the inclusion of lower ARPU prepaid customers associated with the Ka’ena Acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain expenses, gains and losses, which are not reflective of our ongoing operating performance (“Special Items”). Special Items include Sprint Merger-related costs and UScellular merger-related costs (collectively, “Merger-related costs”), certain legal-related expenses, Impairment expense, restructuring costs not directly attributable to the Sprint Merger or UScellular Acquisition (including severance), and other non-core gains and losses. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less device lease revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to monitor the financial performance of our operations and allocate resources of the Company as a whole. We historically used Adjusted EBITDA, and we currently use Core Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, and Special Items. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the Company’s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the exclusion of the related depreciation expense on leased devices from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nNet income\n$\n2,714 \n$\n3,059 \n$\n(345)\n(11)\n%\n$\n8,889 \n$\n8,358 \n$\n531 \n6 \n%\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense, net\n924 \n836 \n88 \n11 \n%\n2,762 \n2,570 \n192 \n7 \n%\nOther expense (income), net\n78 \n(7)\n85 \n(1,214)\n%\n135 \n(19)\n154 \n(811)\n%\nIncome tax expense\n814 \n908 \n(94)\n(10)\n%\n2,757 \n2,515 \n242 \n10 \n%\nOperating income\n4,530 \n4,796 \n(266)\n(6)\n%\n14,543 \n13,424 \n1,119 \n8 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,408 \n3,151 \n257 \n8 \n%\n9,752 \n9,770 \n(18)\n— \n%\nStock-based compensation \n(1)\n217 \n143 \n74 \n52 \n%\n563 \n430 \n133 \n31 \n%\nMerger-related costs, net\n73 \n16 \n57 \n356 \n%\n120 \n137 \n(17)\n(12)\n%\nLegal-related expenses, net \n(3)\n8 \n1 \n7 \n700 \n%\n10 \n16 \n(6)\n(38)\n%\nImpairment expense\n278 \n— \n278 \nNM\n278 \n— \n278 \nNM\nOther, net \n(4)\n170 \n136 \n34 \n25 \n%\n224 \n171 \n53 \n31 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n8,684 \n8,243 \n441 \n5 \n%\n25,490 \n23,948 \n1,542 \n6 \n%\nLease revenues\n(4)\n(21)\n17 \n(81)\n%\n(11)\n(82)\n71 \n(87)\n%\nCore Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,680 \n$\n8,222 \n$\n458 \n6 \n%\n$\n25,479 \n$\n23,866 \n$\n1,613 \n7 \n%\nNet income margin (Net income divided by Service revenues)\n15 \n%\n18 \n%\n-300 bps\n17 \n%\n17 \n%\n— bps\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues)\n48 \n%\n49 \n%\n-100 bps\n48 \n%\n49 \n%\n-100 bps\nCore Adjusted EBITDA margin (Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues)\n48 \n%\n49 \n%\n-100 bps\n48 \n%\n48 \n%\n— bps\n(1)\nStock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree with stock-based compensation expense on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

The components comprising Core Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further above.\nThe increase for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily from:\n•\nHigher Total service revenues; and\n•\nHigher Equipment revenues, excluding Lease revenues; partially offset by\n•\nHigher Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding Special Items; \n•\nHigher Cost of equipment sales, excluding Special Items; and\n•\nHigher Cost of services, excluding Special Items.\nThe increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily from:\n•\nHigher Total service revenues; and\n•\nHigher Equipment revenues, excluding Lease revenues; partially offset by\n•\nHigher Cost of equipment sales, excluding Special Items; \n56\nTable of Contents\n•\nHigher Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding Special Items; and\n•\nHigher Cost of services, excluding Special Items.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $441 million, or 5%, for the three months ended and increased $1.5 billion, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to the fluctuations in Core Adjusted EBITDA, discussed above, partially offset by lower lease revenues, which decreased $17 million for the three months ended and decreased $71 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of debt, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and an unsecured short-term commercial paper program. Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness.\nCash Flows\nThe following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n7,457 \n$\n6,139 \n$\n1,318 \n21 \n%\n$\n21,296 \n$\n16,744 \n$\n4,552 \n27 \n%\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(10,139)\n(3,307)\n(6,832)\n207 \n%\n(15,107)\n(6,772)\n(8,335)\n123 \n%\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(4,238)\n507 \n(4,745)\n(936)\n%\n(8,250)\n(5,293)\n(2,957)\n56 \n%\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 21%, for the three months ended and increased $4.6 billion, or 27%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nThe increase for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily from:\n•\nA $954 million decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use of cash from Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, Accounts receivable, and Equipment installment plan receivables, partially offset by higher use of cash from Other current and long-term assets, Short- and long-term operating lease liabilities and Other current and long-term liabilities;

Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, pay dividends and provide further investment in the business. Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin is calculated as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Service revenues. Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin is utilized by management, investors, and analysts to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert service revenue efficiently into cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, pay dividends and provide further investment in the business.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n7,457 \n$\n6,139 \n$\n1,318 \n21 \n%\n$\n21,296 \n$\n16,744 \n$\n4,552 \n27 \n%\nCash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest\n(2,639)\n(1,961)\n(678)\n35 \n%\n(7,486)\n(6,628)\n(858)\n13 \n%\nProceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions\n— \n984 \n(984)\n(100)\n%\n— \n2,832 \n(2,832)\n(100)\n%\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n$\n4,818 \n$\n5,162 \n$\n(344)\n(7)\n%\n$\n13,810 \n$\n12,948 \n$\n862 \n7 \n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities margin (Net cash provided by operating activities divided by Service revenues)\n41 \n%\n37 \n%\n400 bps\n40 \n%\n34 \n%\n600 bps\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow margin (Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Service revenues)\n26 \n%\n31 \n%\n-500 bps\n26 \n%\n26 \n%\n— bps\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow decreased $344 million, or 7%, for the three months ended and increased $862 million, or 7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nThe decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily from:\n•\nHigher Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, driven by planned timing of capital purchases, including for increased greenfield site builds in the second half of the year and incremental capital expenditures following the acquisition of the UScellular Wireless Business; partially offset by\n•\nHigher Net cash provided by operating activities, as described above.\n•\nCertain cash proceeds associated with the sale of receivables, which were recognized within investing cash flows before November 1, 2024, are recognized as operating cash flows.

Following the effective date of the Pledge Amendments of November 1, 2024, all cash proceeds associated with the sale of such receivables, a portion of which, prior to November 1, 2024, were recognized as Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions within Net cash used in investing activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were recognized as operating cash flows. The Pledge Amendments did not have a net impact on Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\nBorrowing Capacity\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with an aggregate commitment amount of $7.5 billion. As of September 30, 2025, there was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe maintain an unsecured short-term commercial paper program with the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion from time to time. This program supplements our other available external financing arrangements and proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2025, there was no outstanding balance under this program.\nOn August 29, 2025, our wholly owned subsidiary, T-Mobile USA, Inc., entered into a credit agreement with certain financial institutions, backed by an Export Credit Agency (an “ECA Facility”), providing for a loan of up to $1.0 billion (the “ECA Facility due November 2036”).

On March 30, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements, pursuant to which we and the Sellers agreed to bifurcate the transaction into two tranches of licenses, with the \n60\nTable of Contents\nclosings on the acquisitions of certain licenses in Chicago, Dallas and New Orleans being deferred in order to potentially expedite the regulatory approval process for the remainder of the licenses. Subsequently, on August 25, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amendments No. 1 to the Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements, whereby we deferred the closings of certain additional licenses in Chicago and Dallas into the second closing tranche. Together, the licenses with closings deferred into the second closing tranche represent approximately $1.1 billion of the aggregate $3.5 billion cash consideration.\nThe FCC approved the purchase of the first tranche on December 29, 2023. The first tranche closed on June 24, 2024, and the associated payment of $2.4 billion was made on August 5, 2024.\nThe FCC approved the purchase of the Dallas licenses included in the second tranche on October 22, 2024. The purchase of the Dallas licenses closed on December 6, 2024, and the associated payment of $541 million was made on the same day.\nThe FCC approved the remaining Chicago and New Orleans deferred licenses from the second tranche on April 15, 2025. The purchase of the remaining licenses closed on June 2, 2025, and the associated payment of $604 million was made on the same day.\nOn September 12, 2023, we entered into a license purchase agreement with Comcast (the “Comcast License Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we will acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Comcast in exchange for total cash consideration of between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion, subject to an application for FCC approval. The licenses are subject to an exclusive leasing arrangement between us and Comcast entered into contemporaneously with the Comcast License Purchase Agreement. On January 13, 2025, we and Comcast entered into an amendment to the Comcast License Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we will acquire additional spectrum. Subsequent to the amendment, the total cash consideration for the transaction is between $1.2 billion and $3.4 billion. We anticipate closing on the acquisition of approximately $45 million of the spectrum licenses in the first half of 2026, with the remaining spectrum license acquisitions expected to close in the first half of 2028.\nOn September 10, 2024, we entered into a License Purchase Agreement with N77 License Co LLC (“Buyer”), pursuant to which Buyer has the option to purchase all or a portion of our remaining 3.45 GHz spectrum licenses in exchange for a range of cash consideration, with the specific licenses sold to be determined based upon the amount of committed financing raised by Buyer. Following receipt of the required regulatory approvals, on April 30, 2025, we completed the sale of a portion of our 3.45 GHz spectrum licenses for $2.0 billion.\nOn May 30, 2025, we entered into a License and Unit Purchase Agreement with NEWLEVEL IV, L.P. and NEWLEVEL, LLC, both of which are affiliates of Grain Management, LLC (“Grain”), pursuant to which we will sell our 800 MHz spectrum licenses in exchange for cash consideration of $2.9 billion and the receipt of Grain’s 600 MHz spectrum licenses, which we are currently utilizing under lease agreements with Grain. In addition, we may receive a share of certain future proceeds from transactions entered into by Grain that monetize the 800 MHz spectrum licenses, subject to certain terms and conditions and following a certain return on invested capital for Grain. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and contingent on the receipt of regulatory approvals, including the FCC’s approval regarding certain modifications to the 800 MHz spectrum licenses, and is currently expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 or first quarter of 2026. In addition, we expect an increase to our cash income tax liability of approximately $850 million upon the transaction close.\nFor more information regarding our license purchase agreements, see \nNote 7 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets\n \nof the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of Ka’ena Corporation\nOn May 1, 2024, we completed the Ka’ena Acquisition. The total purchase price consists of an upfront payment on the Ka’ena Acquisition Date and an earnout payable in the third quarter of 2026.\nBased on the adjusted amount paid upfront, an additional $420 million in future cash and T-Mobile common stock is payable in satisfaction of the earnout.\nFor more information regarding the Ka’ena Acquisition, see \nNote 2 – Business Combinations\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition of Vistar Media Inc.\nOn February 3, 2025, we completed the Vistar Acquisition, and as a result, Vistar became a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile.

During the three months ended June 30, 2025, we invested $932 million to acquire a 50% equity interest in the joint venture and 97,000 fiber customers. In addition, pursuant to the definitive agreement, we expect to make an additional capital contribution of approximately $500 million between 2027 and 2028 under the existing business plan. \nFor more information regarding the Lumos joint venture, see\n \nNote 3 – Joint Ventures\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMetronet Joint Venture \nOn July 24, 2025, we completed the joint acquisition of Metronet. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we invested $4.6 billion to acquire a 50% equity interest in the joint venture and 713,000 residential fiber customers. We do not anticipate making further capital contributions following the closing under the existing business plan.\nFor more information regarding the Metronet joint venture, see\n \nNote 3 – Joint Ventures\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of UScellular Wireless Business\nOn August 1, 2025, we completed the UScellular Acquisition, and as a result, the UScellular Wireless Business became wholly owned by T-Mobile. In exchange, on the UScellular Acquisition Date, we transferred cash of $2.8 billion. Additionally, the closing of the UScellular Acquisition obligated us to execute the Exchange Offers. On August 5, 2025, we executed the Exchange Offers of certain senior notes of UScellular with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.7 billion for T-Mobile notes with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity dates and redemption terms as each corresponding series of senior notes of UScellular. \nFor more information regarding the UScellular Acquisition, see \nNote 2 – Business Combinations\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of September 30, 2025, we derecognized net receivables of $1.7 billion upon sale through these arrangements.\nFor more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see \nNote 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables\n of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n62\nTable of Contents\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nWe may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional debt, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other long-lived assets in private party transactions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares, pay dividends or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for acquisitions of businesses, spectrum and other long-lived assets, or for any potential stockholder returns, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months, as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of debt, tower obligations, share repurchases, and dividend payments.\nWe determine future liquidity requirements for operations, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividend payments based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum or repurchase shares. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses to comply with the Government Commitments (as defined below), and we have incurred all of the remaining restructuring and integration costs associated with the Sprint Merger, with the cash expenditures for the Sprint Merger-related costs extending beyond 2024. Additionally, we are expecting to incur substantial expenses in connection with the UScellular Acquisition, including coordinating and integrating businesses, operations, policies and procedures. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of additional risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.\nThe indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, create liens or other encumbrances, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of September 30, 2025.\nFinancing Lease Facilities\nWe have uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain third parties that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. We expect to enter into up to a total of $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2025, we have entered into $10.9 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $317 million and $984 million was executed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur liquidity requirements for capital expenditures have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure, the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel and customer base of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is substantially complete, and investments in information technology platforms. We expect to maintain our investment in capital expenditures related to these efforts in 2025 compared to 2024, as we continue to build out our nationwide 5G network and our digital transformation. Future capital expenditure requirements will be primarily driven by the deployment of acquired spectrum licenses.\nFor more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see \nNote 7 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets\n \nof the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nStockholder Returns\nOn December 13, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized our 2025 Stockholder Return Program of up to $14.0 billion that will run through December 31, 2025. The 2025 Stockholder Return Program consists of repurchases of shares of our common stock and the payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of all dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on financial and legal requirements and other considerations. The amount available under the 2025 Stockholder Return Program for share repurchases will be reduced by the amount of any cash dividends declared and paid by us.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe 2025 Stockholder Return Program is consistent with the Company’s capital allocation framework outlined during its Capital Markets Day in September 2024. As discussed at Capital Markets Day, the Company expects its business plan to support approximately $80.0 billion in investments and capital returns between September 18, 2024, and the end of 2027. The Company currently plans to allocate such funds as follows: \n•\nUp to $50.0 billion for share repurchases and cash dividends, which includes the 2025 Stockholder Return Program; \n•\nApproximately $19.0 billion in a discretionary and flexible envelope for potential activities, which may include de-levering, investments in our core business, strategic investments, and/or additional capital returns to stockholders beyond the $50.0 billion initial allocation; and \n•\nApproximately $11.0 billion for announced transactions, including the acquisitions closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

We have relied upon DT and SoftBank for information regarding their respective activities, transactions and dealings. On August 6, 2025, SoftBank ceased to be our affiliate.\nDT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Irancell Telecommunications Services Company, Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2025, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to seven customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank, CPG Engineering & Commercial Services GmbH, Golgohar Trade and Technology GmbH, International Trade and Industrial Technology ITRITEC GmbH, The Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Kara Industrial Trading GmbH.
