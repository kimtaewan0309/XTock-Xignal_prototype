  "item1": "Item 1 Business—Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation\n.\n\n\nIf we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nWe also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.\n\n\nOur operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules, data protection as well as other areas. We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations, applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties, and other adverse effects on our business. United Kingdom data protection laws, including the UK Data Protection Act and legislation commonly referred to as the UK GDPR, has required us to implement, and in the future may require us\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto implement, additional costly, technical and organizational measures designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient’s health and related financial information, and other personal information.\n\n\nWe are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.\n\n\nWe are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.\n \n\n\nWe are subject to pending legal actions, purported stockholder class actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.\n\n\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see \nNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies\n, as included this Form 10-K). We may become subject to additional medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.\n \n\n\nDefending ourselves against the allegations in the lawsuits and governmental investigations, or similar matters and any related publicity, could potentially entail significant costs and could require significant attention from our management and our reputation could suffer significantly.\n \n\n\nFor example, as discussed elsewhere herein:\n\n\n•\nOn March 28, 2024, a jury returned a verdict for compensatory damages of $60 million and punitive damages of $475 million and a related judgment was entered against The Pavilion Behavioral Health System (the “Pavilion”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company. In an order dated October 10, 2024, the trial court ordered a remittitur of punitive damages from $475 million to $120 million. The court denied the Pavilion’s request for reduction of compensatory damages. The Pavilion has filed an appeal of the remaining judgment and the Plaintiff filed a cross appeal of the  remittitur of punitive damages. Plaintiff has filed and served a Citation to Discover Assets (\"Citation\") on the Pavilion as well as Universal Health Services, Inc., and UHS of Delaware, Inc. (\"UHS Entities\") for the purported purpose of executing on the judgment during the pendency of the appeal. We are currently contesting the Citation as to the UHS Entities who were not parties to the litigation as well as the breadth and scope of the Citation issued to the Pavilion. \n\n\n•\nCumberland Hospital for Children and Adolescents (“Cumberland”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in multi-plaintiff lawsuits filed in the Circuit Court for Richmond, Virginia (the “Cumberland Litigation”), relating to allegations of inappropriate sexual contact during medical examinations by Dr. Daniel Davidow, an independent contractor and the former medical director for Cumberland. The Company and UHS of Delaware, Inc., our administrative services subsidiary (“UHS Delaware”), were also named as co-defendants in the Cumberland Litigation. Plaintiffs have asserted claims of negligence, assault and battery (against Dr. Davidow), false imprisonment, violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (“VCPA”), and vicarious liability for Dr. Davidow’s conduct against Cumberland, the Company, and UHS Delaware. The Company and UHS Delaware were dismissed from the action during the trial, which occurred in September, 2024. On September 27, 2024, a jury entered a verdict finding Dr. Davidow and Cumberland liable and awarded these three plaintiffs combined compensatory damages of $60 million for all liability theories, an additional combined $180 million in trebled damages for violation of the VCPA, and an additional combined $120 million in punitive damages. Cumberland is evaluating all legal options and intends to challenge this verdict, including the amounts awarded in the verdict, in post-trial proceedings and on appeal. Based upon Virginia law, we expect that the punitive damage amount should be reduced to a combined maximum of $1.05 million as a matter of law. There are approximately 40 additional plaintiffs making similar allegations with claims pending in the Cumberland Litigation. We expect that the trials for the remaining plaintiffs, as well as any additional plaintiffs, will be scheduled at various times over the next several years and will continue to be tried in small groups.  \n\n\nWe are uncertain as to the ultimate financial exposure related to the Pavilion and Cumberland matters (which relate to occurrences in the 2020 policy year) and we can make no assurances regarding timing or substance of their outcome, or the amount of damages that may be ultimately held recoverable after post-judgment proceedings and appeals. As of December 31, 2024, without reduction for any potential amounts related to the Pavilion and Cumberland matters, the Company and its subsidiaries have aggregate insurance coverage of approximately $221 million remaining under commercial policies for matters applicable to the 2020 policy year (in excess of the applicable self-insured retention amounts of $10 million per single occurrence/$25 million for multi-plaintiff matters for professional liability claims and $3 million per occurrence for general liability claims). In the event the resolution of the Pavilion and/or Cumberland matters exhausts all or a significant portion of the remaining commercial insurance coverage available to the Company and its subsidiaries related to other matters that occurred in 2020, or the Pavilion and Cumberland matters cause the posting of large bonds or other collateral during the appeal processes, our future results of operations and capital resources would be materially adversely impacted.\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any such loss; however, these lawsuits and the related publicity and news articles that have been published concerning these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows which in turn could cause a decline in our stock price. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement. Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material.\n \n\n\nAll professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts and jury verdicts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, applicable per occurrence and aggregate self-insured retentions, and limitations and exclusions pursuant to our commercial insurance policies, is used in estimating our expected liability for self-insured claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Given our significant exposure to professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us, and/or reductions in the amount of commercial coverage available to us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations\n.\n  In addition, our commercial insurance coverage for the period commencing in March, 2025, contains less favorable terms than previous years including coverage exclusions for incidents involving sexual molestation or abuse, higher premiums and potentially lower aggregate limitations.\n \n\n\nWe are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\n \n\n\nIn particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam and stockholder lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs. The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits on behalf of the government against companies alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n\nIf any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n\nThe construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection. Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.\n\n\nAll of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program. The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards. However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.\n\n\nState efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.\n\n\nCertain states in which we operate hospitals have certificates of need (“CON”) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility’s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.\n\n\nIn addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.\n\n\nChanges U.S. and other countries’ trade policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChanges in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from where our import products or materials (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results. In February 2025, the U.S. government imposed or threatened to impose new tariffs, including on imported products from Mexico, Canada and China. The impact of these tariffs is subject to a number of factors, including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs in the future, any retaliatory responses to such actions that the target countries may take and any mitigating actions that may become available. If significant tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, there could be significant strain on our supply chains, causing major disruptions in procurement processes and contract negotiations with suppliers due to increased costs, pricing volatility, longer procurement lead times and supply shortages stemming from increased production costs and import restrictions.  As a result, we have to attempt to shift increased costs onto insurers and patients (in the form of higher service charges), reduce procurement volumes and delay equipment upgrades to mitigate financial strain. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S., Mexico, Canada, China or other countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful.\n\n\nRisks Related to Information Technology\n\n\nA cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of patient or other persons privacy, or other negative impacts.\n\n\nWe rely extensively on our information technology (“IT”) systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payers, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Our IT systems, and the networks and information systems of third parties that we rely on, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber-attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our systems, in turn, interface with and rely on third-party systems that we do not control, including medical devices and other processes supporting the interoperability of healthcare infrastructures. Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, or with whom our systems interface and who may, in some instances, store our sensitive and confidential data, are also subject to the risks outlined above and may not have or use controls effective to protect such information. An attack, breach or other system disruption affecting any of these third parties could similarly harm our business.\n \n\n\nAs cyber criminals continue to become more sophisticated through evolution of their tactics, techniques and procedures, we have taken, and will continue to take, additional preventive measures to strengthen the cyber defenses of our networks and data.  Although we continue to regularly review and enhance our IT systems and cybersecurity controls, we and our third-party provider have experienced, and may experience in the future, cybersecurity incidents. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as filed on February 27, 2024) for information regarding the 2024 cyber incident at UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and the cyber incident we experienced in 2020. While to date no incident had a material impact on our operations or financial results, we cannot guarantee that material incidents will not occur in the future. If any of our or our third-party service providers’ systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data such as protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws and proprietary business information and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations and could result in significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other losses. In the event of a material breach or cyber-attack, the associated expenses and losses may exceed our current insurance coverage for such events. In addition, some adverse consequences are not insurable, such as reputational harm and third-party business interruption. In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information. Further, consumer confidence in the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information systems and information, including patient personal information and critical operations data, in the healthcare industry generally could be impacted to the extent there are successful cyberattacks at other healthcare services companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\n\n\nRisks Related to the Market Conditions and Liquidity\n\n\nOur revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control.\n\n\nOur revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians’ clinical decisions and availability, payer programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornadoes, earthquakes, climate change, current local economic and demographic changes. We have a high concentration of facilities in various geographic areas, including states that have\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\na potentially higher risk of experiencing events such as severe weather conditions and earthquakes. Given the location of our facilities, we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase, or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Any significant loss due to a natural disaster may not be covered by insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance or unavailability on acceptable terms. Climate change may also have effects on our business by increasing the cost of property insurance or making coverage unavailable on acceptable terms. To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our facilities are located, we may experience increased frequency of severe weather conditions or natural disasters or other changes to weather patterns, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, or cash flow may be adversely affected. In addition, government regulation intended to mitigate the impact of climate change, severe weather patterns, or natural disasters could result in additional required capital expenditures to comply with such regulation without a corresponding increase in our revenues. In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.\n \n\n\nA worsening of economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.\n\n\nOur patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets. Worsening of economic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance. As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients. These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.\n\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $3.9 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\n\nContinuing Inflationary Pressures continue to increase our operating costs and we may not be able to pass on increases in costs commensurate with these increases in costs.\n\n\nWe are experiencing inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, and we anticipate continuing impacts on other cost areas within the next twelve months. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices, commercial payers may be unwilling or unable to increase reimbursement rates commensurate with the inflationary impacts on our costs.\n \n\n\nWe continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor. Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.\n\n\nThe cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased. As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds. Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.\n\n\nThe deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.\n\n\nWe require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTo fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility. If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.  The increase in interest rates has substantially increased our borrowing costs and reduced our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.  Additional increases in interest rates and the effect on capital markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our strategy.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\n\nThe number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, 24.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.  To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.\n\n\nIn addition, from time-to-time, our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Pursuant to our stock repurchase program, shares of our Class B Common Stock may be repurchased, from time to time as conditions allow, on the open market or in negotiated private transactions. There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs.\n \n\n\nIn July 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to our stock repurchase program.  During 2024, in conjunction with this program, we have repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $599 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate available repurchase authorization of approximately $824 million.\n \n\n\nOur ability to repurchase shares will depend upon, among other factors, our cash flows from operations, our available capital and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, and investing in our existing markets as well as our results of operations, financial condition, interest rates, our access to the capital markets and other factors beyond our control that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A suspension or elimination of our share repurchase could have a negative effect on our stock price.\n\n\nConversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\n\nThe right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors.\n\n\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.\n\n\nAs of March 18, 2024, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock, which constituted 10.8% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 90.5% of our general voting power as of that date. Also as of that date, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options), which constituted 89.2% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 9.5% of our general voting power as of that date.\n\n\nAs to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.\n\n\nEach share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).\n\n\nIn the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock,\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwhich that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.\n\n\nSince a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family, one of whom is Marc D. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer, President and a director, and they can elect a majority of our company’s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.\n\n\nIn addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.",
  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Sources of Revenue\n for additional disclosure. Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in \nNote 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.\n\n\nRegulation and Other Factors\n\n\nOverview:\n The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal or state health care programs and self-referrals by physicians). Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.\n\n\nLicensing, Certification and Accreditation:\n All of our U.S. hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations in the U.S. and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness. Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.  Our facilities in the United Kingdom are also subject to various laws and regulations.\n \n\n\nAll of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers in the U.S. are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.\n\n\nIf any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payers. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.\n\n\nCertificates of Need:\n Certain of the states in which we operate hospitals have certificates of need (“CON”) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s license, which could harm our business. In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.\n\n\nConversion Legislation:\n Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.\n\n\nUtilization Review:\n Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations require Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group (“DRG”) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay. QIOs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the QIO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program. We have contracted with QIOs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.\n\n\nAudits:\n Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years’ payments subject to various administrative appeal rights. The federal government contracts with third-party “recovery audit contractors” (“RACs”) and “Medicaid integrity contractors” (“MICs”), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers. Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors (“ZPICs”) target claims for potential fraud and abuse. Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors (“MACs”) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) consolidated many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors (“UPICs”), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this consolidation may have. We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations. However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\n\n\nSelf-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation\n\n\nThe Stark Law:\n The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met. These types of referrals are known as “self-referrals.” Medicare may deny payment for all services related to a prohibited referral and a hospital that has billed for prohibited services may be obligated to refund the amounts collected.  In addition, sanctions for violation of the Stark Law may include civil penalties or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart. However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities. This regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.  CMS issued a final rule in 2020 that created a new Stark exception for value-based models. Although the final regulations provide exceptions to the Stark Law, there may remain regulatory risks for participating hospitals, as well as financial and operational risks.\n\n\nWe monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.\n\n\nAnti-kickback Statute:\n A provision of the Social Security Act known as the “anti-kickback statute” prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program. However, changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.\n\n\nThe anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued regulations that provide for “safe harbors,” from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities. These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services. In 2020, the OIG\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nissued a final rule that established an anti-kickback statute safe harbor for value based models. Although the final regulations provide safe harbors, there may remain regulatory risks for participating hospitals, as well as financial and operational risks.  The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.\n\n\nAlthough we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $100,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Civil money penalties may include fines and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\nSimilar State Laws:\n Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure. In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes. However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.\n\n\nThese laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don’t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.\n\n\nIf we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nFederal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations:\n A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government’s behalf under the False Claims Act’s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.\n\n\nWhen a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”) amended and expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds. FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments. In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act. Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court. The False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later. Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.\n\n\nOther Fraud and Abuse Provisions:\n The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud. Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.\n\n\nFurther, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:\n The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information, including recently proposed updates to HIPAA security rule requirements. The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.\n\n\nWe believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance. The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information. HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements. HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred. We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date. HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as potential liabilities resulting from the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.\n\n\nRed Flags Rule:\n In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft. Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.\n\n\nPatient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005:\n On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety. This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report “Patient Safety Work Product” (“PSWP”) to “Patient Safety Organizations” (“PSOs”). Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure. PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety. This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP. PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database. In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.\n\n\nEnvironmental Regulations:\n Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs. In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.\n\n\nCorporate Practice of Medicine:\n Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians. We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.\n\n\nEMTALA:\n All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law generally requires hospitals with an emergency department that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient’s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition. Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndirect result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.\n\n\nThe federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively. CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments. The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future. We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.\n\n\nHealth Care Industry Investigations:\n We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation. Please see \nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n included herein for additional disclosure. In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.\n\n\nWe monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government’s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\n\n\nOur substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.\n\n\nRevenue Rulings 98-15 and 2004-51:\n In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them. The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.\n\n\nState Rate Review:\n Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.\n\n\nMedical Malpractice Tort Law Reform:\n Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level. All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits. Over half of the states have limits on damages awards. Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees. Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform. Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates. Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.\n\n\nCompliance Program:\n Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998. Currently, the program’s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program’s policies.\n\n\nSince its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry’s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnited Kingdom Regulation: \nOur operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements, employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules as well as other areas. We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties and other adverse effects on our business.\n\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\n\nEmployees and Medical Staff\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 99,000 total employees consisting of: (i) approximately 86,000 employees located in the U.S., of which approximately 63,000 were employed full-time, and; (ii) approximately 13,000 employees located in the U.K. Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals. In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours. Within our acute care division, approximately 370 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 510 physicians are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a chief executive officer employed by a subsidiary of ours. In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.\n \n\n\nLabor Relations\n\n\nApproximately 970 of our employees at three of our hospitals are unionized. At Valley Hospital Medical Center, housekeeping and dietary employees are represented by the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226, and engineers are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters, and registered nurses are represented by the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. At the George Washington University Hospital, registered nurses are represented by the District of Columbia Nurses Association.\n\n\nCulture and Work Environment\n\n\nDuring orientation, newly hired employees learn our mission, vision, principles and values, key policies and procedures, a summary of the various benefits and resources available, and perhaps most notably, an overview of our founding principle, Service Excellence. Learning key attributes of our Service Excellence standards, which include continuous improvement, employee development, ethical and fair treatment of all, teamwork, quality, compassion and innovation in service delivery, provides newly hired employees a thorough understanding of our company culture. Other components of our Service Excellence standards, which include treating everyone as a guest, demonstrating professionalism and excellence and practicing teamwork, are shared to help guide the desired approach to day-to-day activities.\n \n\n\nService Excellence Facilitator Certification Workshops are available for facility employees identified by their leadership for consistently upholding and demonstrating our Service Excellence standards. Certified facilitators foster the Service Excellence culture and deliver training at their facilities.  In 2024, we held 12 workshops with 137 individuals certified as Service Excellence Facilitators.\n\n\nDuring 2024, we strengthened our recruitment efforts, improved the overall hiring and onboarding experience (89% very satisfied/satisfied with overall recruitment process), expanded the training resources employees need to do their jobs effectively and safely, facilitated more teamwork and collaboration, addressed burnout, expanded mentorship and increased employee engagement.\n\n\nWe conducted an Employee Engagement Survey and had an overall participation rate of 72% across the organization. 83% of staff indicated “I feel included on my team/work unit.” Engagement efforts such as services awards, safety programs and employee-led service excellence/culture committees has assisted with increased employee retention.\n \n\n\nEthical Standards\n\n\nEach member of our Board of Directors and senior management is committed to healthcare operations that are ethical and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of accountability at all levels and encourage our employees to report anything they believe could be noncompliant with our values. We prohibit retaliation for the good faith reporting of compliance concerns and offer the ability for individuals to anonymously elevate any concerns. Our commitment to fairness and integrity extends to everyone with whom we interact and do business.\n\n\nHealth and Safety\n\n\nPolicies and training programs to encourage work safety are a major focus in our organization. We continue to promote the \nemployee assistance program which has provided a superior level of service to all our employees and members of their households.\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW\ne have continuous training on workplace safety and launched a “We Care” program guide to ensure our hospitals support employees in a detailed way in the event of an employee injury.\n \n\n\nEmployee Development\n\n\nIn keeping with our culture of continuous improvement, training opportunities are available for all employees, regardless of level or status. These include formal instructor-led, in-person or virtual training, informal mentoring or networking opportunities, or self-administered online courses.\n \n\n\nTraining programs are designed to assist with personal and skill development, career advancement and succession planning. In addition to mandatory training that focus on keeping employees mindful and informed of key policies and skill sets, many are voluntary. All training is tailored to include potential Americans with Disabilities Act accommodations.\n \n\n\nAcross the company, we offer educational and work opportunities, including internships, externships and clinical field placement opportunities. We have partnered with Chamberlin University and Drexel University to provide their students with opportunities to earn clinical experience at our healthcare facilities. In 2024, Chamberlin University students participated in more than 1,000 clinical rotations at various acute care and behavioral health care facilities of ours nationwide.\n \n\n\nWe also offer financial assistance programs, such as  educational reimbursement, to support employees participating in degree, certification and continuing education programs.\n\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\n\n\nWe are committed to the principle of Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") for all employees and applicants. As an EEO Employer we support, and are fully committed, to recruitment, selection, placement, promotion and compensation of all individuals without regard to race, color, religion, age (40 and over or as otherwise defined by applicable law), sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), genetic information (including family medical history), national origin, disability status, protected veteran status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.\n\n\nWe value each member of our team and are committed to treating everyone with dignity and respect. Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion includes regularly monitoring employment practices to ensure inclusivity regardless of an employee’s gender, race or ethnicity and championing for inclusive behaviors through leadership example, policies and procedures, training and special events.\n\n\nEmployee Assistance\n \n\n\nWe continue to support the overall health and financial well-being of our employees across the extensive programs and benefit plans that we offer. Employees can access the UHS Resource Guide which provides details on access to the benefits, resources and support tools available to employees throughout our organization.\n\n\nIn 2024, the UHS Foundation continued to support employees and their families who suffered losses due to natural disasters across the country, including tornados in Arkansas and Tennessee, Hurricane Beryl (in Texas) and Hurricanes Debby, Milton and Helene (in Florida).\n \n\n\nEnvironmental\n\n\nWe have implemented environmentally sustainable practices and we comply with applicable legal and regulatory environmental standards to protect our patients, visitors, staff and local communities. Our environmental stewardship includes following best practices when managing energy usage, constructing and designing new builds and/or major renovations and protecting the local environment.\n \n\n\n•\nSmart building technology and automation are used across our enterprise to monitor and inform energy management decisions. Centralized Utility Billing Management System effectively monitors energy usage across our U.S. facilities, signaling significant deviations from normal usage consumption patterns. Automatic fault detection and diagnostics software is implemented in approximately 75% of our acute care hospitals to monitor the efficiencies of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning operations. Most of these facilities also utilize retro-commissioning and monitoring-based commissioning. \n\n\n•\nAll of our newly built facilities, or those undergoing major renovation, are required to meet, or exceed, all federal, state and local energy efficient codes, use mechanical-electrical-plumbing systems to optimize energy efficiencies and water conservation and be equipped with 100% emergency back-up generators, with 96 hours of fuel.\nNew construction or major renovation projects costing at least $20 million are required to be assessed for Green Globes® and/or U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certifications. All newly constructed acute care facilities are also expected to achieve an ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager Score of 90 or higher. \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nOur facilities have policies and procedures that are compliant with the applicable laws from the Environmental Protection Agency, local departments of health and other regulators who oversee the responsible disposal of pollution and waste. \nOur Water Management Program (“WMP”), which is co-managed jointly by a third-party company specializing in water safety, oversees programs for potable and process water (e.g., surgical instrument processing) as well as utility water (e.g., cooling tower, boilers) through active management and hazard control validation. The WPM is designed to ensure safe water throughout our buildings and meets ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 188 (Legionellosis: Risk Management for Building Water Systems). The WPM recently incorporated current ANSI/AAMI ST108: 2023 Water standards for the processing of medical devices and standardized ”flushing protocols” for facilities to use during terminal cleaning process. \n\n\n•\nOur facilities located in the U.K. advanced several environmentally friendly initiatives in 2024 and continued to procure 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. To date, the emission reduction targets for these facilities include:\n\n\no\nNet zero carbon for direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions by 2035.\n\n\no\nNet zero carbon emissions in supply chain (Scope 3) by 2040.\n\n\n•\nBy January 2024,  a vehicle tracking and driver training device program, Lightfoot, was installed on all company-owned vehicles utilized in the U.K. Collectively, the program has reduced CO2 emissions by 236 metric tons across the vehicle fleet since it was introduced in 2020.   \n\n\nOur leadership teams actively manage opportunities and risks related to our facilities, including those related to climate change and other environmental risks.\n \n\n\nRevenue and volume trends may be affected by seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornadoes, earthquakes, climate change, current local economic and demographic changes. We have a high concentration of facilities in various geographic areas, including states that have a potentially higher risk of experiencing events such as severe weather conditions and earthquakes. Given the location of our facilities, we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase, or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Any significant loss due to a natural disaster may not be covered by insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance or unavailability on acceptable terms. Climate change may also have effects on our business by increasing the cost of property insurance or making coverage unavailable on acceptable terms. To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our facilities are located, we may experience increased frequency of severe weather conditions or natural disasters or other changes to weather patterns, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, or cash flow may be adversely affected.\n \n\n\nIn addition, operations may be subject to increases in energy prices as well as increased government regulation, such as the limiting of greenhouse gas emissions, intended to mitigate the impact of climate change, severe weather patterns, or natural disasters. These could result in additional required capital and/or operational expenditures to comply with such regulation without a corresponding increase in our revenues.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nThe health care industry is highly competitive. In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other facilities that provide services comparable to those offered by our facilities. In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.\n\n\nIn some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us. Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals. The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, including outpatient surgical centers and addiction treatment centers offering medically assisted treatments, also increases competition for us.  In addition, some of our hospitals face competition from hospitals or surgery centers that are physician owned.\n\n\nThe number and quality of the physicians on a hospital’s staff are important factors in determining a hospital’s success and competitive advantage. Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient’s needs and insurance coverage, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital’s facilities. We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses and other health care professionals, as well as non-professionals such as mental health technicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.\n \n\n\nCertain states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws. The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states. In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See “Regulation and Other Factors.”\n\n\nOur ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Managed care plans, including managed Medicare and Medicaid plans, attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.\n\n\nAn element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets. The competition to acquire hospitals is significant. We compete for acquisitions with other for-profit health care companies, private equity and venture capital firms, as well as not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.\n\n\nRelationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held approximately 5.7% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement, which is scheduled to expire on December 31\nst\n of each year, pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities. The advisory agreement was renewed by the Trust for 2025 at the same rate in place for 2024, 2023 and 2022, providing for an advisory computation at 0.70% of the Trust’s average invested real estate assets. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $5.5 million during 2024, approximately $5.3 million during 2023 and $5.1 million during 2022.\n\n\nIn addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.\n\n\nOur pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.1 million during 2024, $874,000 during 2023 and $1.2 million during 2022, which are included in other income (expense), net, on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. We received dividends from the Trust amounting to $2.3 million during each of 2024 and 2023 and $2.2 million during 2022.  The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $5.8  million and $7.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of our investment in the Trust was $29.3 million at December 31, 2024 and $34.1 million at December 31, 2023, based on the closing price of the Trust’s stock on the respective dates.\n\n\nThe Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain hospital properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents, which effective as of January 1, 2022 are applicable only to McAllen Medical Center, are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with those subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.\n\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with the Trust, which was amended during the first quarter of 2022, pursuant to the terms of which: (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours purchased from the Trust the real estate assets of the Inland Valley Campus of Southwest Healthcare System located in Wildomar, California, at its fair market value; (ii)  two wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours transferred to the Trust, at their respective fair-market values, the real estate assets of Aiken Regional Medical Center (“Aiken”), located in Aiken, South Carolina (which includes a 211-bed acute care hospital and a 62-bed behavioral health facility), and Canyon Creek Behavioral Health (“Canyon Creek”), located in Temple, Texas, and; (iii) we received approximately $4.1 million in cash from the Trust.\n\n\nAs a result of the purchase options within the lease agreements for Aiken and Canyon Creek, the asset purchase and sale transaction is accounted for as a failed sale leaseback in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have accounted for the asset exchange and substitution transaction with the Trust as a financing arrangement and, since we did not derecognize the real property related to Aiken\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand Canyon Creek, we will continue to depreciate the assets. Our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflects a financial liability of $73.8 million and $77.5 million, respectively, which is included in debt, for the fair value of real estate assets that we exchanged as part of the transaction. Our monthly lease payments payable to the Trust will be recorded to interest expense and as a reduction to the outstanding financial liability. The amount allocated to interest expense is determined using our incremental borrowing rate and is based on the outstanding financial liability.\n\n\nThe aggregate rent payable to the Trust in connection with the leases on McAllen Medical Center, Wellington Regional Medical Center, Aiken Regional Medical Center and Canyon Creek Behavioral Health was approximately $21.2 million during 2024 and $20.6 million during 2023.\n \n\n\nPursuant to the Master Leases by certain subsidiaries of ours and the Trust as described in the table below, dated 1986 and 2021 (“the Master Leases”) which govern the leases of McAllen Medical Center and Wellington Regional Medical Center (each of which is governed by the Master Lease dated 1986), and Aiken Regional Medical Center and Canyon Creek Behavioral Health (each of which is governed by the Master Lease dated 2021), we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above and below by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term. We also have the right to purchase the respective leased hospitals at their appraised fair market value upon any of the following: (i) at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms; (ii) upon one month’s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur, or; (iii) within the time period as specified in the lease in the event that we provide notice to the Trust of our intent to offer a substitution property/properties in exchange for one (or more) of the hospital properties leased from the Trust should we be unable to reach an agreement with the Trust on the properties to be substituted.  In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for a specified period after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for a specified period after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.\n\n\nIn addition, we are the managing, majority member in a joint venture with an unrelated third-party that operates Clive Behavioral Health, a 100-bed behavioral health care facility located in Clive, Iowa. The real property of this facility, which was completed and opened in late 2020, is also leased from the Trust (annual rental of approximately $2.8 million, $2.7 million and $2.6 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively) pursuant to the lease terms as provided in the table below. In connection with the lease on this facility, the joint venture has the right to purchase the leased facility from the Trust at its appraised fair market value upon either of the following: (i) by providing notice at least 270 days prior to the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms, or; (ii) upon 30 days' notice anytime within 12 months of a change of control of the Trust (UHS also has this right should the joint venture decline to exercise its purchase right). Additionally, the joint venture has rights of first offer to purchase the facility prior to any third-party sale.\n\n\nThe table below provides certain details for each of the hospitals leased from the Trust as of January 1, 2025:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Name\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAnnual\nMinimum\nRent\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEnd of Lease Term\n\n\n \n\n\nRenewal\nTerm\n(years)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAllen Medical Center\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,485,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWellington Regional Medical Center\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,805,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiken Regional Medical Center/Aurora Pavilion Behavioral Health Services\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,164,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2033\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanyon Creek Behavioral Health\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,882,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2033\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClive Behavioral Health\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,851,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2040\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n \n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\nWe have one 5-year renewal option at existing lease rates (through 2031).\n\n\n(b)\nWe have one 5-year renewal option at fair market value lease rates (through 2031).  On each January 1\nst\n through 2026, the annual rent will increase by 2.50% on a cumulative and compounded basis.\n\n\n(c)\nWe have seven 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2034 through 2068).  On each January 1\nst\n through 2033, the annual rent will increase by 2.25% on a cumulative and compounded basis.\n\n\n(d)\nThis facility is operated by a joint venture in which we are the managing, majority member and an unrelated third-party holds a minority ownership interest. The joint venture has three, 10-year renewal options at computed lease rates as stipulated in the lease (2041 through 2070) and two additional, 10-year renewal options at fair market values lease rates (2071 through 2090). In each January through 2040 (and potentially through 2070 if three, 10-year renewal options are exercised), the annual rental will increase by 2.75% on a cumulative and compounded basis.  \n\n\n In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings (“MOBs”) and two free-standing emergency departments (\"FED\") owned by the Trust or by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds 95% to 100% of the ownership interest.  In connection with these two FEDs, in October, 2024, our subsidiaries exercised their 5-year renewal options on the facilities which are located in Weslaco and Mission, Texas.  Each renewal option covers the period of February 1, 2025 through January 31, 2030 (the current lease terms were scheduled to expire on January 31, 2025; with aggregate annual lease rates of\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\napproximately $979,000). Pursuant to terms of the leases, and consistent with the terms of the leases currently in effect for each property, the lease rates are scheduled to increase 2% per year through the end of the renewed lease terms. Our subsidiaries have five, 5-year renewal options remaining on each of these FEDs, with the first three renewal options (covering the years 2030 through 2044) providing for 2% annual increases to the lease rates, and the remaining two, 5-year renewal options (covering the years 2045 through 2054) providing for lease rates at the then fair market value. These leases are cross-defaulted with one another and our subsidiaries have the option to purchase the leased properties upon the expiration of each five-year extended term at the fair market value at that time.\n \n \n \n\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Trust acquired the McAllen Doctor's Center, a 79,500 rentable square feet medical office building located in McAllen, Texas.  A master lease was executed between a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and the Trust, pursuant to the terms of which our subsidiary will master lease 100% of the rentable square feet of the MOB at an initial minimum rent of $624,000 annually.  The master lease commenced during August, 2023 and is scheduled to expire in twelve years from that date.\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Trust substantially completed construction on a new 86,000 rentable square foot multi-tenant MOB that is located on the campus of Northern Nevada Sierra Medical Center in Reno, Nevada. Northern Nevada Sierra Medical Center, a 170-bed newly constructed acute care hospital owned and operated by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, was completed and opened in April, 2022. In connection with this MOB, a ten-year master flex lease was executed between a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and the Trust (scheduled to expire in March, 2033), pursuant to the terms of which our subsidiary initially agreed to master lease up to approximately 68% of the rentable square feet of the MOB. The master flex lease has been reduced since inception as certain conditions have been met. A ground lease for this facility commenced during 2023 and is scheduled to expire in 2098.\n\n\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\n\n\nThe executive officers, whose terms will expire at such time as their successors are elected, are as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName and Age\n\n\n \n\n\nPresent Position with the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarc D.

He was formerly employed as Chief Operating Officer at Centura Health, since 2017.  Prior to joining Centura Health, Mr. Sim served in senior leadership roles of increasing responsibility for 11 years at Baptist Health.\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nITEM 1A.\t\nRi\nsk Factors\n\n\nWe are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.\n\n\nRisks Related to Business Operations\n\n\nA significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Texas, Nevada and California.\n\n\nTexas:\n We own 7 inpatient acute care hospitals, 13 free-standing emergency departments, 1 acute outpatient center and 20 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in \nItem 2. Properties\n. On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 16% and 17% of our consolidated net revenues during 2024 and 2023, respectively.  On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 21% in 2024 and 26% in 2023, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.\n\n\nNevada:\n We own 10 inpatient acute care hospitals, 11 free-standing emergency departments, 3 acute outpatient centers and 4 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in \nItem 2. Properties\n. On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 18% and 16% of our consolidated net revenues during 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 27% in 2024 and 16% in 2023, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.\n \n\n\nCalifornia:\n We own 5 inpatient acute care hospitals, 2 acute outpatient centers, 9 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities and 3  behavioral healthcare outpatient facilities as listed in \nItem 2. Properties\n. On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 11%  of our consolidated net revenues during both 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 12% in both 2024 and 2023, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.\n\n\nThis geographic concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, public health, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.  In addition, certain of our facilities and our operations in those states may be adversely impacted by wildfires (most particularly in California), winter storms, and other severe weather conditions, which adverse weather conditions may be more frequent and/or severe as the result of climate change. Such wildfires, storms or other severe weather conditions may cause considerable disruptions in our operations due to property damage or electrical outages experienced in affected areas by our personnel, payers, vendors and others, and may cause our commercial property insurance premiums and/or self-insured retentions to increase significantly.\n \n\n\nOur revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payers.\n\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payers, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services. Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. Changes resulting from the outcome of the 2024 elections may include increased reliance on Medicare Advantage programs, work requirements for Medicaid waiver program eligibility, increased focus on hospital outpatient site neutral payment policies, and similar initiatives that may reduce the availability of funding for federal healthcare programs or make eligibility for benefits more difficult. There have been proposals to substantially decrease federal funding for state Medicaid Programs.  Any significant reduction in federal Medicaid funding to states would likely result in states reducing Medicaid payments to us which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from governmental payers. If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payers in the United States or United Kingdom are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\n\nAs discussed in \nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Summary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs,\n we receive revenues from various state and county-based programs, including Medicaid in all states in which we operate. We receive annual Medicaid revenues of approximately $100 million, or greater, from each of Texas, Nevada, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Kentucky, Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts and Mississippi. We also receive Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments from certain states including, most significantly,\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTexas. Most of these programs are approved on a year-to-year basis and there is no assurance that these revenues will continue at their current rates or at all.  We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.\n \n\n\nIn addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payers, including managed care organizations, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Private payers, including managed care organizations, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.\n\n\nWe expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.\n\n\nIf we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.\n\n\nIn recent years, the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Legislation”) requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services. Also, the No Surprises Act, adopted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”), creates additional price transparency requirements beginning January 1, 2022, including requiring providers to send health plans of insured patients and uninsured patients a good faith estimate of the expected charges and diagnostic codes prior to the scheduled date of the service or item. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing. This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.\n\n\nAn increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.\n\n\nCollection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient’s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles. However, we also have substantial receivables due to us from certain state-based funding programs. We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business office operations, payer mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations. If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.\n\n\nOur hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.\n\n\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other facilities that provide services comparable to those offered by our facilities. Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.\n\n\nIn some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we offer. The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.\n\n\nWe also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom where the National Health Service (the “NHS”) is the principal provider of healthcare services. In addition to the NHS, we face competition in the United Kingdom from independent sector providers and other publicly funded entities for patients.\n \n\n\nIf our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.\n\n\nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.\n\n\nTypically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians. Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time. If we are unable to maintain high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.\n\n\nIt may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain communities in which our hospitals are located. Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.\n\n\nContinued increase in hospital based physician expenses will materially affect our costs and results of operations.\n\n\nIn our acute care segment, during the past few years we experienced significant increases in hospital-based physician related expenses, especially in the areas of emergency room care and anesthesiology. We have implemented various initiatives to mitigate the increased expense, to the degree possible, which has moderated the rate of increase experienced during 2024 and 2023. However, significant increases in these physician related expenses could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.\n\n\nIf we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.\n\n\nThe technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers. To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur. If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.\n\n\nOur performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.\n\n\nWe depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.\n\n\nThe nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers. In particular, like others in the healthcare industry, we experienced a shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel at our acute care and behavioral health care hospitals in many geographic areas which was exacerbated by the COVID‑19 pandemic. In some areas, the increased demand for care during the COVID-19 pandemic put a strain on our resources and staff, which required us to utilize higher‑cost temporary labor and pay premiums above standard compensation for essential workers. Personnel shortages may require us to further enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. To the extent we cannot maintain sufficient staffing levels at our hospitals, we may be required to limit the acute and behavioral health care services provided at certain of our hospitals which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net revenues. In addition, in some markets such as California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels which could adversely affect our net revenues to the extent we cannot meet those levels. If these states increase mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or additional states in which we operate adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios, such changes could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios.\n\n\nWe cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff. If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly. Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.\n\n\nIncreased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs. Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.\n\n\nThe failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.\n\n\nThe economies in the communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers. Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care. The failure of one or more large employer or the closure or\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsubstantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, thereby harming our business.\n\n\nThe trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\n \n\n\nWe believe that value-based purchasing initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards. The Legislation contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing in federal healthcare programs. Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically. In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have “excess readmissions” for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement. Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions unless the conditions were present at admission. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for hospital acquired conditions in the previous year were subject to reduced Medicare reimbursements. The Legislation also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.\n \n\n\nThere is a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services, as well. Many large commercial payers require hospitals to report quality data, and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet or maintain high quality standards established by both governmental and private payers.\n \n\n\nControls designed to reduce inpatient services and increasing rates of “denials” may reduce our revenues.\n\n\nControls imposed by third-party payers designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. In addition, we have been experiencing increasing rates of denied claims (“denials”) from managed care payers, including managed Medicare, which have reduced our net revenues and increased our operating costs as we devote additional resources to enhanced documentation and collection efforts.  Although we cannot predict the effect these factors will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, and reimbursements withheld due to denials, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\n\nWe depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.\n\n\nThe expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.\n \n\n\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\n\n\nReductions or changes in Medicare and Medicaid funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\n\n\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “Budget Control Act”) mandated significant reductions in federal spending for fiscal years 2012-2021, including a reduction of 2% on all Medicare payments during this period. The most recent legislation extended these reductions through 2032. Please see \nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of Revenue-Medicare\n, for additional disclosure.\n\n\nBeginning in 2025 and continuing through 2027, the Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) allotment to the states from federal funds will be reduced. Such reductions have been delayed several times, most recently under the American Relief Act 2025, which delayed the DSH reductions through March 31, 2025. During the reduction period, state Medicaid DSH allotments from federal funds will be reduced by $8 billion annually. Reductions are imposed on states based on percentage of uninsured individuals, Medicaid utilization and uncompensated care. We receive Medicaid DSH payments in certain states including, most significantly, Texas. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.\n\n\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Legislation. Two primary goals of the Legislation are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.\n\n\nAlthough it was expected that as a result of the Legislation there would be a reduction in uninsured patients, which would reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us. The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals. The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care. Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates. As a result of the 2024 federal elections and the \nBraidwood Management v. Becerra \nlitigation currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, it remains unclear what portions of that legislation may remain, or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by future legislation.\n \n\n\nA 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government’s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements. Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding. Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding. As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding. In the past, CMS has granted section 1115 demonstration waivers providing for work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid eligible individuals. The previous Trump administration's section 1115 waiver policy emphasized work requirements, eligibility restrictions on Medicaid, and capped funding.  The second Trump administration may, again, take a similar approach.\n \n\n\nThe Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare. The Legislation amended several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of” the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act. The Legislation also expanded the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid. These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\nWe have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities. These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law. The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.  A repeal of the Legislation, in whole or in relevant part, may result in physicians being able to expand ownership interest in hospitals.\n\n\nInitiatives to repeal or modify the Legislation, in whole or in part, have been persistent. While President Trump did not campaign on repeal of the Legislation, executive and legislative efforts to eliminate or reduce the effect of certain Legislation provisions may yet occur. The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the Legislation and legal challenges to the Legislation are unknown. Legislation has already been enacted that has eliminated the penalty for failing to maintain health coverage that was an integral part of the original Legislation.\n \n\n\nIt remains unclear what portions of the Legislation may remain, or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation. Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services.\n\n\nThe Legislation and its implementation have been, and remain, politically controversial. While attempts to repeal the entirety of the Legislation have not been successful to date, a key provision of the Legislation was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and on December 14, 2018, a Texas Federal District Court Judge declared the Legislation unconstitutional, reasoning that the individual mandate tax penalty was essential to and not severable from the remainder of the Legislation. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which ultimately held in \nCalifornia v. Texas\n that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the Legislation’s requirement to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage, or the individual mandate.  The Court dismissed the case without\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nspecifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Legislation. On September 7, 2022, the same Texas Federal District Court judge, in the case of \nBraidwood Management v. Becerra\n, ruled that the requirement that certain health plans cover services with an “A” or “B” recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force without cost sharing violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that the coverage of certain HIV prevention medication violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The government has appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. We are unable to predict the outcome of this litigation or its potential impact at this time.\n \n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was passed on August 16, 2022, which among other things, allows for CMS to negotiate prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D, beginning with 10 high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. The IRA also continued certain subsidies for individuals to obtain private health insurance under the Legislation through 2025. The effect of the 2024 federal elections on IRA price negotiation provisions or on the likelihood of extended health insurance enrollment subsidies beyond 2025 is not yet known. The Trump administration has already taken steps to undo certain Biden-era executive orders, including those intended to lower drug costs for beneficiaries, and to freeze funding for federal programs. While the administration’s initial freeze has since been rescinded, the administration is likely to make other attempts to reduce federal program expenditures and can generally be expected to oppose increases in ACA and Medicaid enrollment.\n \n\n\nUnder the Legislation, hospitals are required to make public a list of their standard charges, and effective January 1, 2019, CMS has required that this disclosure be in machine-readable format and include charges for all hospital items and services and average charges for diagnosis-related groups. On November 27, 2019, CMS published a final rule on “Price Transparency Requirements for Hospitals to Make Standard Charges Public.” This rule took effect on January 1, 2021 and requires all hospitals to also make public their payer-specific negotiated rates, minimum negotiated rates, maximum negotiated rates and cash for all items and services, including individual items and services and service packages, that could be provided by a hospital to a patient. On April 26, 2023, CMS announced updated enforcement processes that requires a shortened timeline for coming into compliance when a violation has been identified and the automatic imposition of a civil monetary penalties in certain circumstances of noncompliance. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in daily monetary penalties.\n\n\nAs part of the CAA, Congress passed legislation aimed at preventing or limiting patient balance billing in certain circumstances. The CAA addresses surprise medical bills stemming from emergency services, out-of-network ancillary providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance carriers. The legislation prohibits surprise billing when out-of-network emergency services or out-of-network services at an in-network facility are provided, unless informed consent is received. The law provides for a 30-day negotiation period for providers and payers to settle out-of-network claims. If no agreement is reached after this period, either party may opt for a binding independent dispute resolution (“IDR”) process. CMS regulations and guidance implementing the IDR process has been subject to a significant amount of provider-initiated litigation. As a result, portions of those regulations and guidance materials have been vacated by a federal district court, causing CMS to, on several occasions, pause and resume IDR process operations, causing significant delay in the processing of claims. Additionally, arguments made by the plaintiffs in such litigation have included allegations that CMS’s regulations and guidance materials are favorable to payers. For these reasons, there can be no assurances that we will receive timely payments in connection with this process.\n \n\n\nWe are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.\n\n\nIn accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition. If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient’s medical condition, within the facility’s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital’s written procedures. Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward. If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.\n\n\nIf we fail to continue to meet the promoting interoperability criteria related to electronic health record systems (“EHR”), our operations could be harmed.\n\n\nPursuant to Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) regulations, hospitals that did not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 were subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. In the 2019 IPPS final rule, CMS re-named the meaningful use program to “promoting interoperability”.  We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable promoting interoperability criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.\n\n\nThe healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.\n\n\nAmong these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the “Stark Law.” These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements. We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals. The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute. CMS published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law. Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark Law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.\n\n\nFederal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient’s health and related financial information. Such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf. Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.\n\n\nThese laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see \nNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies\n, as included this Form 10-K), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be. See \nItem 1 Business—Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation\n.\n\n\nIf we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nWe also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.\n\n\nOur operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules, data protection as well as other areas. We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations, applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties, and other adverse effects on our business. United Kingdom data protection laws, including the UK Data Protection Act and legislation commonly referred to as the UK GDPR, has required us to implement, and in the future may require us\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto implement, additional costly, technical and organizational measures designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient’s health and related financial information, and other personal information.\n\n\nWe are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.\n\n\nWe are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.\n \n\n\nWe are subject to pending legal actions, purported stockholder class actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.\n\n\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see \nNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies\n, as included this Form 10-K). We may become subject to additional medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.\n \n\n\nDefending ourselves against the allegations in the lawsuits and governmental investigations, or similar matters and any related publicity, could potentially entail significant costs and could require significant attention from our management and our reputation could suffer significantly.\n \n\n\nFor example, as discussed elsewhere herein:\n\n\n•\nOn March 28, 2024, a jury returned a verdict for compensatory damages of $60 million and punitive damages of $475 million and a related judgment was entered against The Pavilion Behavioral Health System (the “Pavilion”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company. In an order dated October 10, 2024, the trial court ordered a remittitur of punitive damages from $475 million to $120 million. The court denied the Pavilion’s request for reduction of compensatory damages. The Pavilion has filed an appeal of the remaining judgment and the Plaintiff filed a cross appeal of the  remittitur of punitive damages. Plaintiff has filed and served a Citation to Discover Assets (\"Citation\") on the Pavilion as well as Universal Health Services, Inc., and UHS of Delaware, Inc. (\"UHS Entities\") for the purported purpose of executing on the judgment during the pendency of the appeal. We are currently contesting the Citation as to the UHS Entities who were not parties to the litigation as well as the breadth and scope of the Citation issued to the Pavilion. \n\n\n•\nCumberland Hospital for Children and Adolescents (“Cumberland”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in multi-plaintiff lawsuits filed in the Circuit Court for Richmond, Virginia (the “Cumberland Litigation”), relating to allegations of inappropriate sexual contact during medical examinations by Dr. Daniel Davidow, an independent contractor and the former medical director for Cumberland. The Company and UHS of Delaware, Inc., our administrative services subsidiary (“UHS Delaware”), were also named as co-defendants in the Cumberland Litigation. Plaintiffs have asserted claims of negligence, assault and battery (against Dr. Davidow), false imprisonment, violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (“VCPA”), and vicarious liability for Dr. Davidow’s conduct against Cumberland, the Company, and UHS Delaware. The Company and UHS Delaware were dismissed from the action during the trial, which occurred in September, 2024. On September 27, 2024, a jury entered a verdict finding Dr. Davidow and Cumberland liable and awarded these three plaintiffs combined compensatory damages of $60 million for all liability theories, an additional combined $180 million in trebled damages for violation of the VCPA, and an additional combined $120 million in punitive damages. Cumberland is evaluating all legal options and intends to challenge this verdict, including the amounts awarded in the verdict, in post-trial proceedings and on appeal. Based upon Virginia law, we expect that the punitive damage amount should be reduced to a combined maximum of $1.05 million as a matter of law. There are approximately 40 additional plaintiffs making similar allegations with claims pending in the Cumberland Litigation. We expect that the trials for the remaining plaintiffs, as well as any additional plaintiffs, will be scheduled at various times over the next several years and will continue to be tried in small groups.  \n\n\nWe are uncertain as to the ultimate financial exposure related to the Pavilion and Cumberland matters (which relate to occurrences in the 2020 policy year) and we can make no assurances regarding timing or substance of their outcome, or the amount of damages that may be ultimately held recoverable after post-judgment proceedings and appeals. As of December 31, 2024, without reduction for any potential amounts related to the Pavilion and Cumberland matters, the Company and its subsidiaries have aggregate insurance coverage of approximately $221 million remaining under commercial policies for matters applicable to the 2020 policy year (in excess of the applicable self-insured retention amounts of $10 million per single occurrence/$25 million for multi-plaintiff matters for professional liability claims and $3 million per occurrence for general liability claims). In the event the resolution of the Pavilion and/or Cumberland matters exhausts all or a significant portion of the remaining commercial insurance coverage available to the Company and its subsidiaries related to other matters that occurred in 2020, or the Pavilion and Cumberland matters cause the posting of large bonds or other collateral during the appeal processes, our future results of operations and capital resources would be materially adversely impacted.\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any such loss; however, these lawsuits and the related publicity and news articles that have been published concerning these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows which in turn could cause a decline in our stock price. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement. Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material.\n \n\n\nAll professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts and jury verdicts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, applicable per occurrence and aggregate self-insured retentions, and limitations and exclusions pursuant to our commercial insurance policies, is used in estimating our expected liability for self-insured claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Given our significant exposure to professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us, and/or reductions in the amount of commercial coverage available to us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations\n.\n  In addition, our commercial insurance coverage for the period commencing in March, 2025, contains less favorable terms than previous years including coverage exclusions for incidents involving sexual molestation or abuse, higher premiums and potentially lower aggregate limitations.\n \n\n\nWe are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\n \n\n\nIn particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam and stockholder lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs. The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits on behalf of the government against companies alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n\nIf any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n\nThe construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection. Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.\n\n\nAll of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program. The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards. However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.\n\n\nState efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.\n\n\nCertain states in which we operate hospitals have certificates of need (“CON”) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility’s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.\n\n\nIn addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.\n\n\nChanges U.S. and other countries’ trade policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChanges in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from where our import products or materials (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results. In February 2025, the U.S. government imposed or threatened to impose new tariffs, including on imported products from Mexico, Canada and China. The impact of these tariffs is subject to a number of factors, including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs in the future, any retaliatory responses to such actions that the target countries may take and any mitigating actions that may become available. If significant tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, there could be significant strain on our supply chains, causing major disruptions in procurement processes and contract negotiations with suppliers due to increased costs, pricing volatility, longer procurement lead times and supply shortages stemming from increased production costs and import restrictions.  As a result, we have to attempt to shift increased costs onto insurers and patients (in the form of higher service charges), reduce procurement volumes and delay equipment upgrades to mitigate financial strain. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S., Mexico, Canada, China or other countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful.\n\n\nRisks Related to Information Technology\n\n\nA cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of patient or other persons privacy, or other negative impacts.\n\n\nWe rely extensively on our information technology (“IT”) systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payers, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Our IT systems, and the networks and information systems of third parties that we rely on, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber-attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our systems, in turn, interface with and rely on third-party systems that we do not control, including medical devices and other processes supporting the interoperability of healthcare infrastructures. Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, or with whom our systems interface and who may, in some instances, store our sensitive and confidential data, are also subject to the risks outlined above and may not have or use controls effective to protect such information. An attack, breach or other system disruption affecting any of these third parties could similarly harm our business.\n \n\n\nAs cyber criminals continue to become more sophisticated through evolution of their tactics, techniques and procedures, we have taken, and will continue to take, additional preventive measures to strengthen the cyber defenses of our networks and data.  Although we continue to regularly review and enhance our IT systems and cybersecurity controls, we and our third-party provider have experienced, and may experience in the future, cybersecurity incidents. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as filed on February 27, 2024) for information regarding the 2024 cyber incident at UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and the cyber incident we experienced in 2020. While to date no incident had a material impact on our operations or financial results, we cannot guarantee that material incidents will not occur in the future. If any of our or our third-party service providers’ systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data such as protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws and proprietary business information and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations and could result in significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other losses. In the event of a material breach or cyber-attack, the associated expenses and losses may exceed our current insurance coverage for such events. In addition, some adverse consequences are not insurable, such as reputational harm and third-party business interruption. In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information. Further, consumer confidence in the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information systems and information, including patient personal information and critical operations data, in the healthcare industry generally could be impacted to the extent there are successful cyberattacks at other healthcare services companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\n\n\nRisks Related to the Market Conditions and Liquidity\n\n\nOur revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control.\n\n\nOur revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians’ clinical decisions and availability, payer programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornadoes, earthquakes, climate change, current local economic and demographic changes. We have a high concentration of facilities in various geographic areas, including states that have\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\na potentially higher risk of experiencing events such as severe weather conditions and earthquakes. Given the location of our facilities, we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase, or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Any significant loss due to a natural disaster may not be covered by insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance or unavailability on acceptable terms. Climate change may also have effects on our business by increasing the cost of property insurance or making coverage unavailable on acceptable terms. To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our facilities are located, we may experience increased frequency of severe weather conditions or natural disasters or other changes to weather patterns, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, or cash flow may be adversely affected. In addition, government regulation intended to mitigate the impact of climate change, severe weather patterns, or natural disasters could result in additional required capital expenditures to comply with such regulation without a corresponding increase in our revenues. In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.\n \n\n\nA worsening of economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.\n\n\nOur patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets. Worsening of economic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance. As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients. These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.\n\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $3.9 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\n\nContinuing Inflationary Pressures continue to increase our operating costs and we may not be able to pass on increases in costs commensurate with these increases in costs.\n\n\nWe are experiencing inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, and we anticipate continuing impacts on other cost areas within the next twelve months. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices, commercial payers may be unwilling or unable to increase reimbursement rates commensurate with the inflationary impacts on our costs.\n \n\n\nWe continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor. Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.\n\n\nThe cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased. As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds. Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.\n\n\nThe deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.\n\n\nWe require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology. We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTo fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility. If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.  The increase in interest rates has substantially increased our borrowing costs and reduced our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.  Additional increases in interest rates and the effect on capital markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our strategy.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\n\nThe number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, 24.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans. Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.  To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.\n\n\nIn addition, from time-to-time, our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Pursuant to our stock repurchase program, shares of our Class B Common Stock may be repurchased, from time to time as conditions allow, on the open market or in negotiated private transactions. There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs.\n \n\n\nIn July 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to our stock repurchase program.  During 2024, in conjunction with this program, we have repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $599 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate available repurchase authorization of approximately $824 million.\n \n\n\nOur ability to repurchase shares will depend upon, among other factors, our cash flows from operations, our available capital and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, and investing in our existing markets as well as our results of operations, financial condition, interest rates, our access to the capital markets and other factors beyond our control that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A suspension or elimination of our share repurchase could have a negative effect on our stock price.\n\n\nConversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\n\nThe right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors.\n\n\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.\n\n\nAs of March 18, 2024, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock, which constituted 10.8% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 90.5% of our general voting power as of that date. Also as of that date, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options), which constituted 89.2% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 9.5% of our general voting power as of that date.\n\n\nAs to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.\n\n\nEach share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).\n\n\nIn the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock,\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwhich that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.\n\n\nSince a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family, one of whom is Marc D. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer, President and a director, and they can elect a majority of our company’s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.\n\n\nIn addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.\n\n\nITEM 1B.\t\nUnresolve\nd Staff Comments\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nITEM 1C.\t\nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity risk management and strategy\nProtecting our data, which includes information related to our patients, members, and customers, is a primary area of our focus.  Given the critical nature of this information, we have developed and implemented a robust cybersecurity risk management program to assess, identify, and manage risks associated with cybersecurity threats as identified in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. \nCybersecurity is an important and \nintegrated\n part of our risk management program that identifies, monitors and mitigates business, operational and legal risks.\n \n This program has a multi-tier risk management structure that includes regular reviews of laws, policies, vulnerabilities, and resource levels to address risks facing our organization.  Such risks include operational, intellectual property theft, fraud, risks that have potential unfavorable impacts on our employees and/or patients, and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n \nTo address cybersecurity risks facing our organization, we have adopted a “continuous risk assessment” process. We engage a \nthird party\n to conduct a bi-annual National Institute of Technology-Cyber Security Framework assessment to determine the effectiveness of our program and related controls.  The results of that assessment are shared with management, which drives prioritization and investment in resources to address those risks.  Likewise, annual penetration tests occur to review the efficacy of our technical controls, results which are reviewed by management and resolved in a timely manner. Other factors that feed into our risk management practices are also operational events and incidents, which can lead to controls being reviewed and enhanced.\n We also have a mature incident response process in place in the event a cybersecurity incident occurs.  This process defines roles, responsibilities and action plans designed to contain and eradicate the issue and then restore systems in the event of a major disruption. Regularly, we conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to an incident and implement any insight gained from those exercises to improve our recovery practices. As part of these processes, we regularly engage with assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third parties to review our cybersecurity program to help identify areas for continued focus, improvement, and compliance.\nWe have a commercial cybersecurity insurance policy that provides for coverage for losses sustained from cybersecurity incidents, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. However, costs and damages associated with cybersecurity incidents could exceed our commercial insurance coverage which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\n \nThird parties who provide services and solutions to our organization are also a source of cyber risk. Through a third-party risk management program, we review risks associated with these third parties through contractual reviews, vendor risk assessments, and continual risk reviews by monitoring the cybersecurity risk exposure these third parties pose and implementing remediation where necessary.\nBased on the information available as of the date of this Form 10-K, during our fiscal year 2024 and through the date of this filing, we \ndid not identify any risks\n from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents \n(as such terms are defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K), that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For more information on risks to us from cybersecurity threats, see “\nRisks Related to Information Technology - A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of patient or other persons privacy, or other negative impacts\n.” under “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n.”\n \nGovernance of Cybersecurity\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCybersecurity is an integral part of our risk management program and is an area of focus for our Board of Directors and management.  The Audit Committee of our \nBoard of Directors is \nresponsible\n for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.\n \nMembers of the Audit Committee receive updates, as warranted, including quarterly updates from our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) regarding matters of cybersecurity, such as key risks facing the healthcare industry and our company, core topics, review of incidents, as well as progress against key information security initiatives.\n Senior executive leadership also engage in ad-hoc discussions with management on cybersecurity topics.\n In addition, \nour Board of Directors are provided with an annual report regarding cybersecurity information and related topics\n.\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by \nour CISO along with leaders from our Information Security, Compliance, Legal and Internal Auditing teams. Such individuals have an average of over 20 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including security, auditing, compliance, systems and programming.\n These individuals monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan.\n \n\n\nITEM 2.\t\nP\nroperties\n\n\nExecutive and Administrative Offices and Commercial Health Insurer\n\n\nWe own

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.  Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those presented under \nItem 1A. Risk Factors, \nand below in \nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors \nand as included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  This section generally discusses our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.  For discussion of our result of operations and changes in our financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, please refer to \nPart II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.\n \n \n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOur principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities and behavioral health care facilities.\n \n\n\nAs of February 26, 2025, we owned and/or operated 359 inpatient facilities and 60 outpatient and other facilities, including the following, located in 39 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico:\n\n\nAcute care facilities located in the U.S.:\n\n\n•\n28 inpatient acute care hospitals;\n\n\n•\n33 free-standing emergency departments, and;\n\n\n•\n10 outpatient centers & 1 surgical hospital.\n\n\nBehavioral health care facilities (331 inpatient facilities and 16 outpatient facilities):\n \n\n\nLocated in the U.S.:\n\n\n•\n181 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, and;\n\n\n•\n14 outpatient behavioral health care facilities. \n\n\nLocated in the U.K.:\n\n\n•\n147 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, and;\n\n\n•\n2 outpatient behavioral health care facilities.\n\n\nLocated in Puerto Rico:\n\n\n•\n3 inpatient behavioral health care facilities.\n\n\nNet revenues from our acute care hospitals, outpatient facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 56% of our consolidated net revenues during 2024 and 57% during 2023. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 44% of our consolidated net revenues during 2024 and 43% during 2023.\n \n\n\nOur behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. generated net revenues of approximately $880 million in 2024 and $761 million in 2023. Total assets at our U.K. behavioral health care facilities were approximately $1.358 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $1.327 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\nServices provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.\n\n\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors\n\n\nYou should carefully review the information contained in this Annual Report, and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In this Annual Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. This Annual Report contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nstrategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will or will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “appears,” “projects” and similar expressions, or the negative of those words and expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.  In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth herein in \nItem 1A. Risk Factors. \n Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements.\n \n\n\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.  Many factors, including those set forth herein in \nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n, and other important factors disclosed in this report, and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:\n\n\n•\nthe healthcare industry is labor intensive and salaries, wages and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supplies expense and other operating expenses. In the past, staffing shortages have, at times, required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, there have been occasions when we were unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, we were required to limit patient volumes. We have also experienced general inflationary cost increases related to certain of our other operating expenses. Many of these factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations in prior years, have moderated more recently. However, we cannot predict future inflationary increases, which if significant, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.  We have experienced inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, although those pressures have moderated more recently. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices;\n\n\n•\nin our acute care segment, we have experienced a significant increase in hospital based physician related expenses, especially in the areas of emergency room care and anesthesiology. We have implemented various initiatives to mitigate the increased expense, to the degree possible, which has moderated the rate of increase.  However, significant increases in these physician related expenses could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations;\n\n\n•\nthe increase in interest rates during the past few years has increased our interest expense significantly thereby reducing our free cash flow.  As such, although interest rates have moderated more recently, the effects of increased borrowing rates have adversely impacted our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict future changes to interest rates, however, significant increases in our borrowing rates could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations and our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms;\n\n\n•\nPresident Biden signed into law fiscal year 2025 appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects and activities through March 14, 2025. We cannot predict whether or not there will be future legislation averting a federal government shutdown, however, our operating cash flows and results of operations could be materially unfavorably impacted by a federal government shutdown;\n\n\n•\non December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, was signed into law phasing out the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage rate that states received during the COVID-19 public health emergency and fully eliminated the increase on December 31, 2023.  States were also permitted to begin Medicaid eligibility redeterminations on March 31, 2023, which has resulted in a decrease in Medicaid enrollment;\n\n\n•\nour ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations, including the recently enacted and proposed significant new tariffs. Significant tariffs or other restrictions, if imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, could escalate costs of medications, medical devices and medical equipment and disrupt our supply chains. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S. and the \n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nimpacted foreign countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful;\n\n\n•\nan increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. For example, Congress has reduced to $0 the penalty for failing to maintain health coverage that was part of the original Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \"Legislation\") as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. To date, the Biden administration has issued executive orders implementing a special enrollment period permitting individuals to enroll in health plans outside of the annual open enrollment period and reexamining policies that may undermine the Legislation or the Medicaid program. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was passed on August 16, 2022, which among other things, allows for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to negotiate prices for certain single-source drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. The American Rescue Plan Act’s expansion of subsidies to purchase coverage through a Legislation exchange, which the IRA continued through 2025, has increased exchange enrollment. However, the Trump administration has already taken steps to undo certain Biden-era executive orders, including those intended to lower drug costs for beneficiaries, and to freeze funding for federal programs. While the administration’s initial freeze has since been rescinded, the administration is likely to make other attempts to reduce federal program expenditures and can generally be expected to oppose increases in ACA and Medicaid enrollment. If the subsidies are not extended beyond 2025, exchange enrollment may be adversely impacted;\n\n\n•\nthere have been numerous political and legal efforts to expand, repeal, replace or modify the Legislation, since its enactment, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the Legislation, as well as court challenges to the constitutionality of the Legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court held in \nCalifornia v. Texas\n that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the Legislation’s requirement to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage, or the individual mandate.  The Court dismissed the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Legislation. As a result, the Legislation continued to remain law, in its entirety. On September 7, 2022, the Legislation faced its most recent challenge when a Texas Federal District Court judge, in the case of \nBraidwood Management v. Becerra\n, ruled that a requirement that certain health plans cover services without cost sharing violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that the coverage of certain HIV prevention medication violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which on June 21, 2024, affirmed the District Court’s ruling regarding preventive services recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force being unconstitutional. However, the Fifth Circuit overturned the nationwide injunction imposed by the District Court, preserving access to the majority of preventive services in dispute for now. The U.S. Government appealed and on January 10, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the matter. The outcome and impacts of this litigation cannot be predicted. Any future efforts to challenge, replace or replace the Legislation or expand or substantially amend its provision is unknown.  See below in \nSources of Revenues and Health Care Reform\n for additional disclosure; \n\n\n•\nas part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the \"CAA\"), Congress passed legislation aimed at preventing or limiting patient balance billing in certain circumstances. The CAA addresses surprise medical bills stemming from emergency services, out-of-network ancillary providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance carriers. The CAA prohibits surprise billing when out-of-network emergency services or out-of-network services at an in-network facility are provided, unless informed consent is received.  In these circumstances providers are prohibited from billing the patient for any amounts that exceed in-network cost-sharing requirements. HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury have issued rules to implement the legislation. The rules have limited the ability of our hospital-based physicians to receive payments for services at usually higher out-of-network rates in certain circumstances, and, as a result, have caused us to increase subsidies to these physicians or to replace their services at a higher cost level;\n\n\n•\nin June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in\n Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo\n and \nRelentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce\n, which modified the regulatory interpretation standard established 40 years ago by \nChevron v. National Resources Defense Council\n. Chevron doctrine generally required courts to defer to federal agencies in their interpretation of federal statutes when a statute was silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue.  In \nLoper Bright\n, the Supreme Court held that courts are no longer required to grant such deference, though they may consider an agency’s statutory interpretation. As it is highly regulated, the health care industry could be significantly impacted by the\n Loper Bright \ndecision, particularly in the areas of Medicare reimbursement, decision making by the Food & Drug \n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdministration and health care fraud and abuse compliance, where parties may no longer be able to rely on federal agencies’ policies, rules and guidance;\n\n\n•\npossible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payers or government based payers, including Medicare or Medicaid in the United States, and government based payers in the United Kingdom;\n\n\n•\nour ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same; \n\n\n•\nthe outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, inquiries, false claims act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters, and the effects of adverse publicity relating to such matters, including, but not limited to, the jury verdicts returned against The Pavilion Behavioral Health System (the \"Pavilion\") and Cumberland Hospital for Children and Adolescents (\"Cumberland\"), two of our indirect subsidiaries, as disclosed in \nNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies, Legal Proceedings.\n We are uncertain as to the ultimate financial exposure related to the Pavilion and Cumberland matters (which relate to occurrences in the 2020 policy year) and we can make no assurances regarding timing or substance of their outcome, or the amount of damages that may be ultimately held recoverable after post-judgment proceedings and appeals. As of December 31, 2024, without reduction for any potential amounts related to the Pavilion and Cumberland matters, the Company and its subsidiaries have aggregate insurance coverage of approximately $221 million remaining under commercial policies for matters applicable to the 2020 policy year (in excess of the applicable self-insured retention amounts of $10 million per single occurrence/$25 million for multi-plaintiff matters for professional liability claims and $3 million per occurrence for general liability claims). In the event the resolution of the Pavilion and/or Cumberland matters exhausts all or a significant portion of the remaining commercial insurance coverage available to the Company and its subsidiaries related to other matters that occurred in 2020, or the Pavilion and Cumberland matters cause the posting of large bonds or other collateral during the appeal processes, our future results of operations and capital resources would be materially adversely impacted;\n\n\n•\ncompetition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;\n\n\n•\ntechnological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;\n\n\n•\nour ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor and related expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals;\n\n\n•\ndemographic changes;\n\n\n•\nthere is a heightened risk of future cybersecurity threats, including ransomware attacks targeting healthcare providers. If successful, future cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any costs that we incur as a result of a data security incident or breach, including costs to update our security protocols to mitigate such an incident or breach could be significant. Any breach or failure in our operational security systems, or any third-party security systems that we rely on, can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential member or protected personal or health information and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other liability or losses. We may also incur additional costs related to cybersecurity risk management and remediation. There can be no assurance that we or our service providers, if applicable, will not suffer losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all the costs resulting from such events;\n\n\n•\nthe availability of suitable acquisition and divestiture opportunities and our ability to successfully integrate and improve our acquisitions since failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits from certain of our prior or future acquisitions could result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangibles;\n\n\n•\nthe impact of severe weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes and climate change;\n\n\n•\nour business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) goals or comply with emerging ESG regulations, or otherwise meet the expectations of our stakeholders with respect to ESG matters;\n\n\n•\nas discussed below in \nSources of Revenue\n, we receive revenues from various state and county-based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate. We receive annual Medicaid revenues of approximately $100 million, or greater, from each of Texas, Nevada, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Kentucky, Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts and Mississippi. Most of these programs are approved on a year-to-year basis and there is no assurance that these revenues will continue at their current rates or at all. The prior President Trump administration had attempted to limit Medicaid expenditures by, for example, attaching work requirements to eligibility for Medicaid waiver benefits. The \n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsecond Trump administration is likely to explore similar solutions to limit Medicaid enrollment or expenditure. The Trump administration has already taken steps to undo Biden-era executive orders and to freeze funding for federal programs. While the administration’s initial freeze has since been rescinded, the administration is likely to make other attempts to reduce federal program expenditures and can generally be expected to oppose increases in ACA and Medicaid enrollment. We also receive Medicaid DSH payments in certain states including, most significantly, Texas. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states;\n \n\n\n•\nour ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;\n\n\n•\nour inpatient acute care and behavioral health care facilities may experience decreasing admission and length of stay trends;\n\n\n•\nour financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payers and there can be no assurance that failure of the payers to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;\n\n\n•\nthe Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. Current legislation has extended these reductions through 2032.  We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward;\n\n\n•\nuninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;\n\n\n•\nchanges in our business strategies or development plans;\n\n\n•\nwe have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the pound sterling. We have international subsidiaries that operate in the United Kingdom.  We routinely hedge our exposures to foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses;\n\n\n•\nthe impact of a shift of care from inpatient to lower cost outpatient settings and controls designed to reduce inpatient services on our revenue, and;\n\n\n•\nother factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\nGiven these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n\n\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in \nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue Recognition:\n We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payers and others for services rendered. We have agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. Payment arrangements include rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans, which represent explicit price concessions, are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payers may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.\n\n\nSee \nNote 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Revenue Recognition\n, for additional disclosure related to our revenues including a disaggregation of our consolidated net revenues by major source for each of the periods presented herein.\n\n\nWe estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations. The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements. Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2024, 2023 or 2022. If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2024, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $2 million.\n\n\nCharity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Other Adjustments to Revenue:\n  Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient’s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. We estimate our revenue adjustments for implicit price concessions based on general factors such as payer mix, the aging of the receivables and historical collection experience.  We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.\n \n\n\nHistorically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income of various amounts, dependent upon the state, ranging from 200% to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, the transaction price is fully adjusted and there is no impact in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.\n\n\nA portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient’s responsible party at the time of registration. At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible. When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient’s Medicaid eligibility. When the patient’s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts net revenues in future periods. Although the patient’s ultimate eligibility determination may result in adjustments to net revenues, these adjustments did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2024 or 2023 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to adjust revenue based on historical collections.\n\n\nWe also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in “uninsured discounts” amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, the transaction price is fully adjusted and there is no impact in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable. In implementing the discount policy, we\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfirst attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.\n \n\n\nUncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):\n\n\nThe following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharity care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n819,681\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n843,449\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninsured discounts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,677,026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n77\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,792,493\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n68\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal uncompensated care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,496,707\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,635,942\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated cost of providing uncompensated care:\n\n\nThe estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the adjustments to net revenues and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(amounts in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost of providing charity care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75,227\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n83,383\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost of providing uninsured discounts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n245,687\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n177,206\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost of providing uncompensated care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n320,914\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n260,589\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Insured/Other Insurance Risks:\n We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims, workers’ compensation claims and healthcare and dental claims. Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts and jury verdicts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.\n \n\n\nIn addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Nevada and Puerto Rico, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported. Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\n\n\nSee \nNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies\n for additional disclosure related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers’ compensation liability.\n\n\nLong-Lived Assets:\n  We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.  Please see additional disclosure below in \nProvision for Asset Impairments, \nfor disclosure regarding a provision for asset impairment recorded during 2022.\n\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets:\n Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more often if indicators of impairment arise. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.  We have designated October 1\nst\n as our annual impairment assessment date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n \n\n\nWe performed an impairment assessment as of October 1, 2024 which indicated no impairment of goodwill.  There was no goodwill impairment during 2023.\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFuture changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\n\nIncome Taxes:\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards, tax credits, and interest deduction limitations.\n\n\nDue to recent guidance and enacted laws surrounding the global 15% minimum tax rate that will be effective after 2024 from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") as well as jurisdictions that we operate in, we anticipate adverse effects to our provision for income taxes as well as cash taxes. We do not expect these adverse effects to be material and will continue to monitor changes in tax policies and laws issued by the OECD and jurisdictions that we operate in.\n \n\n\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.  We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.\n\n\nSee \nNote 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Income Taxes \nfor additional disclosure of our effective tax rates.\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\n  For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements, please see \nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Standards\n as included in this Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nClinical Staffing, Physician Related Expenses and Effects of Inflation:\n \n\n\nThe healthcare industry is labor intensive and salaries, wages and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supplies expense and other operating expenses. In the past, staffing shortages have, at times, required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, there have been occasions when we were unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, we were required to limit patient volumes. We have also experienced general inflationary cost increases related to certain of our other operating expenses. Many of these factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations in prior years, have moderated more recently. However, we cannot predict future inflationary increases, which if significant, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.\n\n\nWe have experienced inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, although those pressures have moderated more recently. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices.\n\n\nIn our acute care segment, during the past few years we experienced significant increases in hospital-based physician related expenses, especially in the areas of emergency room care and anesthesiology. We have implemented various initiatives to mitigate the increased expense, to the degree possible, which has moderated the rate of increase experienced during 2024. However, significant increases in these physician related expenses could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.\n\n\nAlthough our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited, as discussed above, we have been requesting and negotiating increased rates from commercial insurers to defray our increased cost of providing patient care. In addition, we have implemented various productivity enhancement programs and cost reduction initiatives including, but not limited to, the following: team-based patient care initiatives designed to optimize the level of patient care services provided by our licensed nurses/clinicians; efforts to reduce utilization of, and rates paid for, premium pay labor; consolidation of medical supply vendors to increase purchasing discounts; review and reduction of clinical variation in connection with the utilization of medical supplies, and; various other efforts to increase productivity and/or reduce costs including investments in new information technology applications.\n\n\n           The following table summarizes our results of operations, and is used in the discussion below, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,827,935\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n14,281,976\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating charges:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,518,687\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,107,484\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,308,384\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,757,216\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplies expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,587,786\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,532,828\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n584,831\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n568,041\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease and rental expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n146,433\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n141,026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,146,121\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n89.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,106,595\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n91.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from operations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,681,814\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,175,381\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n186,109\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n206,674\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,231\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,281\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,497,936\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n940,426\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n334,827\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n221,119\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,163,109\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n719,307\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable   \n   to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,012\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,512\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to UHS\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,142,097\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n717,795\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues increased by 10.8%, or $1.55 billion, to $15.83 billion during 2024 as compared to $14.28 billion during 2023. The increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to:\n\n\n•\na $1.32 billion or 9.5% increase in net revenues generated from our acute care and behavioral health care operations owned during both periods (which we refer to as “same facility”), and;\n\n\n•\n$222 million of other combined net increases consisting primarily of a $239 million increase in provider tax assessments which had no impact on income before income taxes since amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.     \n\n\nIncome before income taxes increased by $558 million, or 59%, to $1.50 billion during 2024 as compared to $940 million during 2023. The increase was attributable to:\n\n\n•\nan increase of $295 million at our acute care facilities, as discussed below in \nAcute Care Hospital Services\n;   \n\n\n•\nan increase of $277 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in \nBehavioral Health Services, \nand;\n\n\n•\n$14 million of other combined net decreases.      \n\n\nNet income attributable to UHS increased by $424 million, or 59%, to $1.14 billion during 2024 as compared to $718 million during 2023. This increase was attributable to:\n\n\n•\na $558 million in income before income taxes, as discussed above;\n\n\n•\na decrease of $20 million due to an increase in the net income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, and;\n\n\n•\na decrease of $114 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $538 million increase in pre-tax income (consisting of $558 million increase in income before income taxes minus a $20 million increase in the income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests), partially offset by; (ii) a $16 million decrease in the provision for income taxes during 2024, as compared to 2023, from the net tax benefit recorded pursuant to ASU 2016-09, net of the impact of executive compensation limitations pursuant to IRC section 162(m).  \n\n\nAdjustments to Self-Insured Professional and General Liability Reserves:\n\n\nOur estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts and jury verdicts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.\n \n\n\nAs a result of unfavorable trends experienced during 2024 and 2023, our results of operations included pre-tax increases to our reserves for self-insured professional and general liability claims amounting to approximately $79 million during 2024 and $25\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmillion during 2023. During 2024, approximately $54 million of the reserves increase is included in our Same Facility basis acute care hospitals services’ results, and approximately $25 million is included in our behavioral health services’ results. During 2023, approximately $18 million of the reserves increase is included in our Same Facility basis acute care hospitals services’ results, and approximately $7 million is included in our behavioral health services’ results.\n \n\n\nAcute Care Hospital Services\n\n\nThe following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our acute care hospital services for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSame Facility Basis\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAll\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n6,657\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,644\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,670\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,691\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n6,485\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,472\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,498\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,519\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient days\n\n\n \n\n\n1,600,445\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,569,792\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,601,579\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,576,074\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily census\n\n\n \n\n\n4,372.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,300.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,375.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,318.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n65.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n67.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n66.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n66.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n \n\n\n331,113\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n321,155\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n331,415\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n322,218\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of stay\n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcute Care Hospital Services-Same Facility Basis\n\n\nWe believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived and intangible assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.\n \n\n\nOur Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below \nSources of Revenue-Summary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.\n However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under \nAll Acute Care Hospital Services\n. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.

Included in our Same Facility basis' net revenues and income before income taxes, during 2024, was approximately $186 million of net reimbursements (net of related provider taxes) recorded in connection with the Nevada state directed payment program which was approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in December, 2023.  Please see additional disclosure below in Sources of Revenue-Nevada State Directed Payment Program (\"SDP\").\n\n\nDuring 2024, net revenue per adjusted admission increased by 5.1% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased by 6.3%, as compared to 2023. During 2024, as compared to 2023, inpatient admissions to our acute care hospitals increased by 3.1% while adjusted admissions increased by 2.9%. Patient days and adjusted patient days at these facilities increased by 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively, during 2024, as compared to 2023. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.8 days and 4.9 days during 2024 and 2023, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was approximately 67% during each of 2024 and 2023.\n \n\n\nOn a Same Facility basis during 2024, as compared to 2023, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $115 million, or 3.4%. Although our acute care facilities experienced an increase in patient volumes during 2024, as compared to the 2023, the related incremental staffing cost increase was offset by the following: (i) a reduction in premium pay (overtime paid to employees and external temporary resources' expense) which decreased by approximately $48 million during 2024, as compared to 2023, and; (ii) a restructuring, that occurred in early 2024, at certain of our acute care hospitals that reduced the number of employees in positions that were not directly related to the delivery of patient care. As a percentage of net revenues, salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased to 40.9% during 2024 as compared to 42.9% during 2023.\n\n\nOther operating expenses increased by $214 million, or 9.9%, during 2024, as compared to 2023. Operating expenses incurred by our commercial health insurer, consisting primarily of medical costs, increased by $69 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. In addition, as discussed above in \nResults of Operations-Adjustments to Self-Insured Professional and General Liability Reserves\n, included in the other operating expenses of our acute care hospital services during 2024, as compared to 2023, was a $36 million increase in the adjustments made to our self-insured professional and general liability reserves that was applicable to our acute care facilities. Excluding these expense items from each year, other operating expenses increased by $109 million, or 6.3%. Contributing to the increase during 2024, as compared to 2023, were the expenses incurred in connection with the increase in patient volumes. As a percentage of net revenues, other operating expenses increased to 27.8% during 2024, as compared to 27.4% during 2023.\n\n\nSupplies expense increased by $43 million, or 3.3%, during 2024, as compared to 2023.  As a percentage of net revenues, supplies expense decreased to 15.9% during 2024, as compared to 16.7% during 2023.\n \n\n\nAll Acute Care Hospital Services\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2024 and 2023. These amounts include: (i) our acute care results on a same facility basis, as indicated above; (ii) the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes, and; (iii) certain other amounts including, if applicable, the operating results of recently acquired/opened facilities, or divested/closed facilities, including the operating results for Desert Springs Hospital which discontinued all inpatient operations during the first quarter of 2023.

The increase resulted from the $301 million, or 54%, increase in income before income taxes at our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as discussed above, and $6 million of other combined net decreases resulting primarily from the losses incurred at the newly constructed 150-bed West Henderson Hospital located in Las Vegas, Nevada, that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n \n\n\nDuring 2024, as compared to 2023, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $105 million, or 3.1%. The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $115 million increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, partially offset by a combined other net decrease of $10 million (consisting primarily of a decrease related to Desert Springs Hospital, partially offset by an increase related to West Henderson Hospital).\n\n\nOther operating expenses increased $396 million, or 16.9%, during 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was due primarily to the $214 million above-mentioned increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as well as the above-mentioned $187 million increase in provider tax assessments.\n \n\n\nSupplies expense increased by $42 million, or 3.2%, during 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $43 million increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis.\n \n\n\nPlease see \nResults of Operations - Clinical Staffing, Physician Related Expenses and Effects of Inflation\n above for additional disclosure regarding the factors impacting our operating costs.\n \n\n\nBehavioral Health Care Services\n\n\nThe following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our behavioral health care services for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSame Facility Basis\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAll\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n24,165\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,367\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,224\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n24,065\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23,900\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,280\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,124\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient days\n\n\n \n\n\n6,397,790\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,277,015\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,446,651\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,336,927\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily census\n\n\n \n\n\n17,480.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,197.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,613.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,361.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n72.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n71.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n71.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n72.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n \n\n\n472,798\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n468,260\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n476,584\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n472,307\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of stay\n\n\n \n\n\n13.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Health Care Services-Same Facility Basis\n\n\nWe believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived and intangible assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.\n \n\n\nOur Same Facility basis results reflected on the table below also excludes from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below \nSources of Revenue-Summary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.\n However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under \nAll Behavioral Health Care Services\n. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.

Income before income taxes increased by $281 million, or 25.9%, amounting to $1.366 billion or 20.4% of net revenues during 2024, as compared to $1.085 billion or 17.9% of net revenues during 2023.\n \n\n\nDuring 2024, net revenue per adjusted admission increased by 9.8% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased by 8.8%, as compared to 2023. During 2024, as compared to 2023, inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions to our behavioral health care hospitals increased by 1.0% and 0.7%, respectively.  Patient days at these facilities increased by 1.9% and adjusted patient days increased by 1.7% during 2024, as compared to 2023. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 13.5 days and 13.4 days during 2024 and 2023, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 73% and 72% during 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n\n\nOn a Same Facility basis during 2024, as compared to 2023, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased $245 million or 7.3%.  The increase during 2024, as compared to 2023, was due to a 3.2% increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense per average full-time equivalent employee, as well as a 4.0% increase in the average number of full time equivalent employees. The increased staffing was due, in part, to increased patient volumes. As a percentage of net revenues during each year, salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased to 53.6% during 2024 as compared to 55.3% during 2023.\n \n\n\nOther operating expenses increased $94 million, or 8.0%, during 2024, as compared to 2023. Included in the increase, as discussed above in \nResults of Operations-Adjustments to Self-Insured Professional and General Liability Reserves\n, included in the other operating expenses of our behavioral health care services during 2024, as compared to 2023, was an $18 million increase in the adjustments made to our self-insured professional and general liability reserves that was applicable to our behavioral health facilities. As a percentage of net revenues during each year, other operating expenses decreased to 18.8% during 2024 as compared to 19.3% during 2023.\n \n\n\nSupplies expense increased $13 million, or 6.0%, during 2024, as compared to 2023.

Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPatients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.\n\n\nSources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:\n Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal and state budget deficits in general may affect the availability of government funds to provide additional relief in the future. Changes resulting from the outcome of the 2024 elections may include increased reliance on Medicare Advantage programs, work requirements for Medicaid waiver program eligibility, increased focus on hospital outpatient site neutral payment policies, and similar initiatives that may reduce the availability of funding for federal healthcare programs or make eligibility for benefits more difficult. There have been proposals to substantially decrease federal funding for state Medicaid Programs. Any significant reduction in federal Medicaid funding to states would likely result in states reducing Medicaid payments to us which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.\n\n\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Legislation”) was enacted and its two primary goals were to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. The Legislation revised reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high-quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals. The Legislation provides for reductions to Medicaid DSH payments which are scheduled to begin in 2025.\n\n\nA 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government’s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements. Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion by reducing their existing Medicaid funding. Therefore, states can choose to expand or not to expand their Medicaid program without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding. As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding. CMS has previously granted section 1115 demonstration waivers providing for work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid eligible individuals. CMS has also released guidance to states interested in receiving their Medicaid funding through a block grant mechanism. The Biden administration withdrew certain previously issued section 1115 demonstrations aligned with these policies, but Georgia has imposed work and community engagement requirements under a Medicaid demonstration program that launched July 1, 2023. President Trump, more favorable to work and community engagement requirements in his first administration, is more likely to again seek these obligations for Medicaid demonstration programs. If additional section 1115 demonstrations that include work and community requirements are implemented, we anticipate that they would lead to reductions in coverage and likely increases in uncompensated care in those states where these demonstration waivers are granted.\n\n\nOn December 14, 2018, a Texas Federal District Court deemed the Legislation to be unconstitutional in its entirety. The Court concluded that the Individual Mandate is no longer permissible under Congress’s taxing power as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reducing the individual mandate’s tax to $0 (i.e., it no longer produces revenue, which is an essential feature of a tax), rendering the Legislation unconstitutional.  The Court also held that because the individual mandate is “essential” to the Legislation and is inseverable from the rest of the law, the entire Legislation is unconstitutional. That ruling was ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which decided in \nCalifornia v. Texas\n that the plaintiffs in the matter lacked standing to bring their constitutionality claims.  The Court did not reach the plaintiffs’ merits arguments, which specifically challenged the constitutionality of the Legislation’s individual mandate and the entirety of the Legislation itself. As a result, the Legislation will continue to be law, and the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and its respective agencies will continue to enforce regulations implementing the law. However, on September 7, 2022, the Legislation faced its most recent challenge when a Texas Federal District Court judge, in the case of \nBraidwood Management v. Becerra\n, ruled that a requirement that certain health plans cover services without cost sharing violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that the coverage of certain HIV prevention medication violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which on June 21, 2024 affirmed the District Court’s ruling regarding preventive services recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force being unconstitutional. However, the Fifth Circuit overturned the nationwide injunction imposed by the District Court, preserving access to the majority of preventive services in dispute for now. The government has appealed the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court. The outcome and impacts of this litigation cannot be predicted.\n\n\nThe Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare. The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncommit a violation of” the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act. In December, 2024, CMS changed the standard for identification of an overpayment and now requires the report and return of an overpayment if a provider or supplier has actual knowledge of the existence of an overpayment or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of an overpayment. The Legislation also expanded the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid. These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\nWe have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities. These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law. The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities. A repeal of the Legislation, in whole or in relevant part, may result in physicians being able to expand ownership interest in hospitals.\n\n\nIn addition to legislative changes, the Legislation can be significantly impacted by executive branch actions. The Biden administration had issued executive orders implementing a special enrollment period permitting individuals to enroll in health plans outside of the annual open enrollment period and reexamining policies that may undermine the ACA or the Medicaid program. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021's expansion of subsidies to purchase coverage through an exchange contributed to increased exchange enrollment in 2021. The IRA’s extension of subsidies through 2025 was expected to increase exchange enrollment in future years. However, the Trump administration has already taken steps to undo certain Biden-era executive orders, including those intended to lower drug costs for beneficiaries, and to freeze funding for federal programs. While the administration’s initial freeze has since been rescinded, the administration is likely to make other attempts to reduce federal program expenditures and can generally be expected to oppose increases in ACA and Medicaid enrollment.\n\n\nIt remains unclear what portions of the Legislation may remain, or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.  Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services.\n\n\nFor additional disclosure related to our revenues including a disaggregation of our consolidated net revenues by major source for each of the periods presented herein, please see \nNote 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Revenue Recognition\n.\n\n\nMedicare:\n Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.\n\n\nUnder the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold. MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.\n\n\nIn August, 2024, CMS published its IPPS 2025 final payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the Legislation are considered, without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\napproximately 1.8%. Including DSH payments, an increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2025 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025) will approximate 1.2%.\n\n\nIn August, 2023, CMS published its IPPS 2024 final payment rule which provides for a 3.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates (including a change in the Medicare Rural Floor calculation), documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the Legislation are considered, without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 6.6%. Including DSH payments, an increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2024 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024) will approximate 5.4%.\n\n\nIn August, 2022, CMS published its IPPS 2023 final payment rule which provides for a 4.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the Legislation are considered, without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 4.6.%. Including DSH payments, an increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2023 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023) will approximate 4.4%. This projected impact from the IPPS 2023 final rule includes an increase of approximately 0.5% to partially restore cuts made as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, but excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the 2011 Act, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.\n\n\nIn June, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a decision favorable to hospitals impacting prior year Medicare DSH payments (\nAzar v. Allina Health Services\n, No. 17-1484 (U.S. Jun. 3, 2019)).  In \nAllina\n, the hospitals challenged the Medicare DSH adjustments for federal fiscal year 2012, specifically challenging CMS’s decision to include inpatient hospital days attributable to Medicare Part C enrollee patients in the numerator and denominator of the Medicare/SSI fraction used to calculate a hospital’s DSH payments.  This ruling addresses CMS’s attempts to impose the policy espoused in its vacated 2004 rulemaking to a fiscal year in the 2004–2013 time period without using notice-and-comment rulemaking. This decision should require CMS to recalculate hospitals’ DSH Medicare/SSI fractions, with Medicare Part C days excluded, for at least federal fiscal year 2012, but likely federal fiscal years 2005 through 2013.  In August, 2020, CMS issued a rule that proposed to retroactively negate the effects of the aforementioned Supreme Court decision, which rule has yet to be finalized. Although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately receive additional funds, we estimate that the favorable impact of this court ruling on certain prior year hospital Medicare DSH payments could range between $18 million to $28 million in the aggregate.\n\n\nThe 2011 Act included the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year. Subsequent legislation has extended this sequestration through 2032.  The CARES Act, as amended, temporarily suspended or limited the application of this sequestration from May 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, with a return to the full 2% Medicare payment reduction thereafter.\n\n\nInpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program are paid under a Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”). Medicare payments to psychiatric hospitals are based on a prospective per diem rate with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.\n\n\nIn July, 2024, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2025. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units from the market basket update are estimated to increase by 2.8% compared to federal fiscal year 2024. This amount includes the effect of the 3.3% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.5% productivity adjustment. When all of the final patient level adjustments described below as well as proposed wage index values are considered, we estimate that Psych PPS payments will increase by 2.1% in FFY 2025.\n\n\nIn addition to the market basket update noted above, CMS will make the following changes:\n\n\n•\nRevisions to the methodology for determining the payment rates under the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility (\"IPF\") PPS for psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units based on a review of the data and information collected in prior years in accordance with section 1886(s)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act, as added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (\"CAA of 2023\"). CMS finalized revisions to the IPF patient-level adjustment factors. The patient-level adjustments include Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS–DRGs) assignment of the patient’s principal diagnosis, selected comorbidities, patient age, and the variable per diem adjustments;\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nImplement these revisions in a budget-neutral manner (that is, estimated payments to IPFs for FFY 2025 would be the same with or without the final revisions), and;\n\n\n•\nClarified the criteria regarding all-inclusive cost reporting. This clarification requires our behavioral health care hospitals, which are currently utilizing an all-inclusive charging practice, to modify both their billing practices and information technology applications by June 1, 2025 to ensure compliance with future regulations.  We intend to be in compliance with this CMS billing requirement.\n\n\nThis final rule also includes two requests for information on future revisions to the IPF PPS facility-level adjustment factors and development of the new standardized IPF Patient Assessment Instrument, required by the CAA of 2023, which IPFs participating in the IPF Quality Reporting Program will be required to report for Rate Year 2028.\n\n\nIn July, 2023, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2024. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 3.3% compared to federal fiscal year 2023. This amount includes the effect of the 3.5% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.2% productivity adjustment.\n\n\nIn July, 2022, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2023. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 3.8% compared to federal fiscal year 2022. This amount includes the effect of the 4.1% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.3% productivity adjustment.\n\n\nOn November 2, 2023, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAmerican Hospital Association v. Becerra\n (142 S. Ct. 1896 (2022)) and the district court’s remand to the agency, CMS issued a final rule outlining the remedy for the 340B-acquired drug payment policy for calendar years 2018-2022. CMS published the final rule to remedy the payment rates the Court held were invalid aspects of their past policy and will affect nearly all hospitals paid under the OPPS.  As part of the final remedy, CMS will make an adjustment to the update factor to maintain budget neutrality as required by statute. CMS finalized the 340B policy for calendar year 2018 in 2017 in a budget neutral manner that included increasing payments for non-drug items and services; this payment increase was in effect from calendar years 2018 through 2022. CMS estimates that hospitals were paid $7.8 billion more for non-drug items and services during this time period than they would have been paid in the absence of the 340B payment policy.  Because CMS is now making additional payments to affected 340B covered entity hospitals to pay them what they would have been paid had the 340B policy never been implemented, CMS will make a corresponding offset to maintain budget neutrality as if the 340B payment policy had never been in effect. To carry out this required $7.8 billion budget neutrality adjustment, CMS will reduce future non-drug item and service payments by adjusting the OPPS conversion factor by minus 0.5% starting in calendar year 2026 and continuing for 16 years. The impact of this 0.5% reduction on our 2026 results of operations is approximately $4 million.\n\n\nIn November, 2024, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2025. The hospital market basket increase is 3.4% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.5% for a net market basket increase of 2.9%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, including a 14.2% increase to the partial hospitalization rate, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2025 will aggregate to a net increase of 3.6%.\n\n\nIn November, 2023, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2024. The hospital market basket increase is 3.3% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.2% for a net market basket increase of 3.1%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2024 will aggregate to a net increase of 9.7%. This percentage reflects the impact resulting from rural floor changes to the Medicare wage index adjustment factor where certain states, such as California and Nevada, will materially benefit from this change.\n\n\nIn November, 2022, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2023. The hospital market basket increase is 4.1% and the productivity adjustment reduction is -0.3% for a net market basket increase of 3.8%.  The final rule provides that in light of the Supreme Court decision in \nAmerican Hospital Association v. Becerra\n, CMS is applying the default rate, generally average sales price plus 6%, to 340B acquired drugs and biologicals for 2023.  During the 2018-2022 time period, we recorded an aggregate of approximately $45 million to $50 million of Medicare revenues related to the prior 340B payment policy. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, as well as impact of the aforementioned 340B Program policy change, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2023 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 0.9% which includes a 0.3% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2022. The hospital market basket increase is 2.7% and the productivity adjustment reduction is -0.7% for a net market basket increase of 2.0%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2022 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 2.4% which includes a 3.0% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.\n\n\nIn November, 2019, CMS finalized its Hospital Price Transparency rule that implements certain requirements under the June 24, 2019 Presidential Executive Order related to Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First. Under this final rule, effective January 1, 2021, CMS will require: hospitals to make public: (1) their standard changes (both gross charges and payer-specific negotiated charges) for all items and services online in a machine-readable format, and; (2) standard charge data for a limited set of “shoppable services” the hospital provides in a form and manner that is more consumer friendly. On\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNovember 2, 2021, CMS released a final rule increasing the monetary penalty that CMS can impose on hospitals that fail to comply with the price transparency requirements. We believe that our hospitals are in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations. In November, 2023, CMS finalized multiple provisions, effective as of January 1, 2024, focused on increasing hospital price transparency and compliance enforcement including but not limited to: (1) standard charges data would be posted online using a CMS template, instead of using the hospital’s own form/format; (2) all standard charge information would be encoded with a specified set of data elements (e.g., hospital name; license number; payer/plan name; description of service; billing codes, among others); (3) other technical changes related to increasing consumers’ automated accessibility to hospital standard charges, and; (4) certifications regarding accuracy of standard charge data and related compliance warning notices from CMS and requiring accessibility to health system leadership regarding transparency noncompliance.\n\n\nIn September, 2024, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and the Treasury published final rules that:\n\n\n•\nMandate that insurers analyze the outcomes of their coverage to ensure there's equivalent access to mental health care, including provider networks, prior authorization rates and payment for out-of-network providers, and take action to get in compliance;\n\n\n•\nEstablish when health plans can’t use prior authorization or other tactics to make it more difficult to access mental health and substance use treatment, and;\n\n\n•\nRequire additional insurers to comply with the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.\n\n\nWhile these rules will likely improve patient access to inpatient and outpatient mental health services, we are unable to estimate the related potential impact on our results of operations.\n\n\nMedicaid\n: Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.\n\n\nWe receive revenues from various state and county-based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate. We receive annual Medicaid revenues of approximately $100 million, or greater, from each of Texas, Nevada, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Kentucky, Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts and Mississippi.  We also receive Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including, most significantly, Texas. Many of these programs have a Medicaid supplemental payment component that are subject to approval on a year-to-year basis and there is no assurance that these supplemental payment revenues will continue at their current rates or at all. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\n\n\nThe Legislation substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014. However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the Legislation requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. Accordingly, many states in which we operate have not expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level. Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the Legislation may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in fiscal year 2024, as discussed below. We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\n\n\nSummary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes the revenues, healthcare provider taxes (“Provider Taxes”) and net benefit related to each of the below-mentioned Medicaid supplemental programs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The Provider Taxes are recorded in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income, as included herein. The \"Estimated 2025\" amounts reflected on the table below are, in many cases, subject to federal and potentially state approval and may be affected by any reductions or other changes in federal funding for these programs.\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(amounts in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Supplemental Payment Programs:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n308\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n336\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n247\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvider Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n(127\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(131\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(82\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet benefit\n\n\n$\n\n\n181\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n205\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n165\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevada SDP:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n347\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n310\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n13\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvider Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n(125\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(116\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet benefit\n\n\n$\n\n\n222\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n194\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Other State Programs:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n836\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n853\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n593\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvider Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n(290\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(289\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(211\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet benefit\n\n\n$\n\n\n546\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n564\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n382\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-Provider Tax Programs:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,491\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,499\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n853\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvider Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n(542\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(536\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(297\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate net benefit from Provider Tax Programs\n\n\n$\n\n\n949\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n963\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n556\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas, Nevada and South Carolina DSH/SPA Programs:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n53\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n73\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Provider Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Net benefit\n\n\n$\n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n53\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n73\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Supplemental Medicaid Programs:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,539\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,552\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n926\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Provider Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n(542\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(536\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n(297\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate net benefit from all Supplemental Programs\n\n\n$\n\n\n997\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,016\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n629\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Supplemental Payment Programs:\n\n\nCertain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs. The 1115 Waiver has been approved by CMS through September 30, 2030. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital’s indigent care obligation.\n\n\nCHIRP (including QIF)\n\n\nOn August 1, 2022, CMS approved the Comprehensive Hospital Increase Reimbursement Program (\"CHIRP\"), with a pool of $5.2 billion, for the rate period effective September 1, 2022 to August 31, 2023. On July 31, 2023, CMS approved the CHIRP program, with a pool of $6.5 billion, for the rate period of September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2024. On September 13, 2024, CMS approved the CHIRP program with a pool of $6.5 billion for the rate period September 1, 2024 to August 31, 2025 (with an amended CMS approval on October 1, 2024).\n\n\nOn January 26, 2024, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (\"THHSC\") issued a final rule that will modify the CHIRP payments beginning with the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2025 rate period to promote the advancement of the quality goals and strategies the program is designed to advance.\n\n\nThe final modifications include:\n\n\n•\nCreation of a new pay-for-performance incentive payment through a third component in CHIRP, the Alternate Participating Hospital Reimbursement for Improving Quality Award (\"APHRIQA\"). For state fiscal years beginning with SFY 2025, behavioral health hospitals and rural hospitals will not be included in the pay-for-performance program, and;\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nThe funds for payment of the APHRIQA component will be transitioned from the existing uniform rate increase components of the Uniform Hospital Rate Increase Percentage and the Average Commercial Incentive Award and will be paid using a scorecard that directs managed care organizations to pay providers for performance achievements on quality outcome measures. Payments will be distributed under APHRIQA on a semi-annual basis that aligns with the measurement period determined for quality metrics reporting.\n\n\nCHIRP payment levels could be reduced materially if our hospitals are not able meet the required APHRIQA pay-for-performance metrics.\n\n\nIn connection with the Quality Incentive Fund (“QIF”), the results of operations of certain of our acute care hospitals located in Texas included aggregate revenues of $50 million and $33 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were earned pursuant to contract terms with various Medicaid managed care plans which requires the annual payout of QIF funds when a managed care service delivery area’s actual claims-based CHIRP payments are less than targeted CHIRP payments for a specific rate year.\n \n\n\nWe estimate that these hospitals will be entitled to approximately $29 million of aggregate QIF revenues during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nUC\n\n\nIncluded in these provider tax programs are reimbursements received in connection with the Texas Uncompensated Care program (\"UC\"). The size and distribution of the UC pool are determined based on charity care costs reported to THHSC in accordance with Medicare cost report Worksheet S-10 principles.\n\n\nHARP\n\n\nOn September 24, 2021, THHSC finalized New Fee-for-Service Supplemental Payment Program: Hospital Augmented Reimbursement Program (“HARP”) to be effective October 1, 2021. The HARP program continues the financial transition for providers who have historically participated in the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program described below. The program, which was approved by CMS on August 15, 2023, will provide additional funding to hospitals to help offset the cost hospitals incur while providing Medicaid services. HARP is technically a Medicaid Upper Payment Limit as payment under this program is based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for the services under Medicare payment principles but is referred to as HARP by THHSC.\n \n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $43 million and $20 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Approximately $16 million of the amount recorded during 2024 was applicable to the period of October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Approximately $13 million of the amount recorded during 2023 was applicable to the period of October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.\n \n\n\nWe expect our net reimbursements pursuant to HARP to approximate $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nNevada State Directed Payment Program (\"SDP\"):\n\n\nAs previously reported, in February, 2023, the Nevada Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (“DHCFP”) outlined a new provider fee on private hospitals located in Nevada that would effectively capture new Medicaid federal share for certain categories of services eligible for the new payment program. In late December, 2023, CMS approved the Medicaid managed care component of the Nevada SDP program, with an effective date of January 1, 2024. In November 2024, CMS approved an increased assessment rate which funded an increase in the SDP pool size covering the period of July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. Payments made pursuant to this component of the Nevada SDP program, which requires annual approval by CMS, are subject to reconciliation by DHCFP based on actual Medicaid managed care utilization during 2024. There can be no assurance that the Medicaid managed care component of the Nevada SDP will continue for any period after December 31, 2024, or that it will not be modified.\n \n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $194 million and $9 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our aggregate net reimbursements pursuant to both components of the Nevada SDP program (net of related provider taxes) will approximate $222 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The Nevada SDP for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025 is under CMS' review for approval.\n \n\n\nVarious Other State Programs:\n\n\nWe receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. The states include, but are not limited to, the state programs listed below from which we receive significant reimbursements.\n\n\nKentucky Hospital Rate Increase Program (“HRIP”)\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn early 2021, CMS approved the Kentucky Medicaid Managed Care Hospital Rate Increase Program. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $88 million and $73 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In December, 2024, CMS approved the program for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025 at rates comparable to the prior year.\n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to HRIP will approximate $84 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nCalifornia Supplemental Payments\n\n\nIn California, the state continues to operate Medicaid supplemental payment programs consisting of three components: Fee For Service Payment, Managed Care-Pass-Through Payment and Managed Care-Directed Payment. The non-federal share for these programs are financed by a statewide provider tax. The Directed Payment method will be based on actual concurrent hospital Medicaid managed care in-network patient volume whereas the other programs are based on prior year Medicaid utilization. The CMS program approval status is outlined in the table below.\n\n\nCalifornia Hospital Fee Program CMS Approval Status:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Fee Program Component\n\n\nCMS Methodology Approval Status\n\n\nCMS Rate Setting Approval Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFee For Service Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024; Paid through September 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Care-Pass-Through Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2022 and paid in advance through December 31, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Care-Directed Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2022 and paid in advance through June 30, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was $47 million and $46 million during the years ended  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $63 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nMississippi Hospital Access Program\n\n\nIn September, 2023, subject to CMS approval, Mississippi announced a $689 million, two-part Medicaid payment proposal, effective retroactively to July 1, 2023, that would be funded by annual hospital assessments to the state's Medicaid program. These hospital assessments are calculated using a formula provided under state law. The first part of the program, known as the Mississippi Hospital Access Program (“MHAP”), provides direct payments for hospitals that serve patients in the state's Medicaid managed care delivery system. Hospitals are reimbursed near the average commercial rate, which is the upper limit (\"UPL\") for Medicaid managed care reimbursements. The second part of the program supplements traditional Medicaid payment rates for hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient services up to Medicaid's regulated UPL. In June 2024, CMS approved the MHAP program component for the period July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. The UPL component was approved in April, 2024.\n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $48 million and $33 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these supplemental payment programs will approximate $44 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nFlorida Medicaid Managed Care Directed Payment Program (“DPP”)\n\n\nThe Florida DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, our results of operations included approximately $46 million and $43 million recorded in connection with this program (substantially all of which was recorded during the fourth quarters of each year).\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this DPP will approximate $37 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.  The Florida DPP for the period of October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 is under CMS' review for approval.\n\n\nIllinois Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs\n\n\nThe Illinois Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs are comprised of three components: (1) Medicaid managed care directed payment program; (2) Medicaid managed care pass-through program, and; (3) Medicaid fee for service supplemental payment program. These programs require various related legislative and regulatory approvals each year.\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $39 million and $36 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these supplemental payment programs will approximate $36 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. Approval of these programs for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 is under CMS' review.\n \n\n\nIndiana Medicaid Managed Care DPP\n\n\nThe Indiana DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $31 million recorded during each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nOklahoma (Transition to Managed Care and Implementation of a Medicaid Managed Care DPP)\n\n\nThe current Oklahoma Medicaid supplemental payment program in effect, prior to the planned implementation of the new DPP in 2024, is the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (“SHOPP”). The SHOPP component will remain in place for certain categories of Medicaid patients that will continue to be enrolled in the traditional Medicaid Fee for Service program.\n\n\nIn May, 2022, Oklahoma enacted legislation that directs the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (\"OHCA\") to: (i) transition its Medicaid program from a fee for service payment model to a managed care payment model by no later than October 1, 2023, and: (ii) concurrently implement a Medicaid managed care DPP using a managed care gap of 90% of average commercial rates. In December, 2022, the OHCA delayed the implementation date of the Medicaid managed care change and related DPP until April 1, 2024. In September, 2023, CMS approved the DPP program for the 15-momth period effective as of April 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.\n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $20 million and $12 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these two supplemental payment programs (i.e. SHOPP and DPP) will approximate $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nSouth Carolina Health Access, Workforce and Quality (“HAWQ”) Program\n\n\nIn September 2023, CMS approved the South Carolina HAWQ Program retroactive to July 1, 2023 and subsequently approved by CMS in July, 2024 for the period of July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. This program is a Medicaid managed care directed payment program that provides for a rate enhancement to Medicaid managed care encounters. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $28 million and $11 million recorded during the years ended  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $26 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nMichigan Directed Payment Program (“DPP”)\n\n\nIn March 2024, CMS approved the Michigan Medicaid DPP retroactive to October 1, 2023 based on average commercial rates. The Michigan DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $37 million and $17 million recorded during the years ended  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The Michigan DPP for the period of October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 is under CMS' review for approval.\n \n\n\nIdaho Upper Payment Limit (“UPL”)\n\n\nIn April 2024, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (“IDHW”) released its updated Medicaid UPL calculation for SFY 2024 (July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024) and revised its SFY 2023 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023) UPL calculation. Subject to CMS approval, the IDHW plans to continue this UPL program through SFY 2025 (July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025) at payment levels comparable to SFY 2024. In SFY 2026, the IDHW intends to replace the UPL program with a Medicaid managed care state directed payment program. We are unable to predict whether payments levels under the planned new state directed payment program will be comparable to the SFY 2024 UPL payment levels.\n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $31 million and $22 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nWashington Safety Net Assessment Program\n\n\nOn April 2, 2024, CMS approved an expanded state directed payment program in Washington whereby payments will now be based on the average commercial rates. The program was approved retroactively for the period January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $46 million and $3 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this expanded program will approximate $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. Approval of this program for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 is under CMS' review.\n\n\nNew Mexico State Directed Payment Program (“SDP”)\n\n\nIn November, 2024, CMS approved the New Mexico Medicaid SDP, retroactive to July 1, 2024, based on average commercial rates. The New Mexico SDP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $8 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. There was no impact from this program included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The program requires the submission of an annual report that demonstrates that 75% of the incremental net funds were used for the delivery of and access to healthcare services in the state.\n\n\nThe state agency intends to renew the program for calendar year 2025 at payments level consistent with the 2024 annualized payment level. The New Mexico SDP for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 is under CMS' review. We estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $16 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nTennessee Directed Payment Program (“DPP”)\n\n\nTennessee SB1740, enacted in May, 2024, imposes an annual coverage assessment on covered hospitals for fiscal year 2024-2025. The total assessment on all covered hospitals in the aggregate will be equal to 6% of the federally recognized annual coverage assessment base. The assessment proceeds will be used to fund an increase to the state’s DPP payment pool to be based on average commercial rates. In January, 2025, CMS approved the DPP payment increase for the period July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, contingent upon CMS' approval of the state's 1115 Medicaid Waiver amendment . The DPP preprint for calendar year (January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025) is pending CMS approval.\n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $28 million during the year ended December 31, 2025 (related to the six-month period July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024), if CMS' approval of the state's 1115 Medicaid Waiver amendment occurs during 2025. In addition, although we are unable to predict whether the DPP program for calendar year 2025 will be approved by CMS, or the timing of such approval, TennCare's financial models indicate that our annual DPP reimbursements could range from $40 million to $56 million. The \"Estimated 2025\" amounts reflected on the table above do not include any net reimbursements in connection with the Tennessee DPP.\n\n\nWashington, D.C. State Directed Payment program (“SDP”)\n\n\nIn July, 2024, the Budget Support Act (B24-0784) was approved by the mayor of Washington, D.C. This legislation includes a new Medicaid managed care directed payment program that, if ultimately approved, could become effective for the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, with potential subsequent annual programs. Finalization of this program remains contingent upon U.S. Congressional and CMS approval. Estimated amounts related to this program are subject to change for various reasons including modifications based upon CMS' review of the preprint payment methodology terms, as well as actual Medicaid managed care utilization for hospitals that operate in the District of Columbia, including ours. If ultimately approved, there can be no assurance that this program will continue for any period after September 30, 2025, or that it will not be modified.  The Washington, D.C., Medicaid agency submitted the SDP preprint to CMS in July 2024, for review and approval.\n \n\n\nAlthough we cannot predict if this new SDP program will be ultimately approved, or the timing of such approval should it occur, if approved in its current form, we estimate that our aggregate net benefit from this program for the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, related to our two existing hospitals in the market, will approximate $85 million.  The \"Estimated 2025\" amounts reflected on the table above do not include any net reimbursements in connection with the Washington, D.C. SDP program.\n\n\nTexas DSH and Nevada SPA Programs:\n\n\nTexas DSH\n\n\nUpon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ low income patients, our qualifying facilities located in Texas receive additional reimbursement from the state’s DSH fund. The Texas DSH program was renewed for the state’s 2025 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025).\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $36 million and $47 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nWe estimate that our aggregate net reimbursements earned pursuant to the Texas DSH program will approximate $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nThe Legislation and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2025 (see above in \nSources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid\n for additional disclosure related to the delay of these DSH reductions). HHS is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas, will be reduced in the coming years. Based on the CMS final rule published in September, 2019 (as amended by the CARES Act and the CAA), beginning in fiscal year 2025, annual Medicaid DSH payments in Texas could be reduced by approximately 41% from current DSH payment levels. A series of federal continuing resolutions were passed by the federal government which provided for ongoing federal funding.\n\n\nIn connection with certain previous DSH and UC adverse federal court decisions, including the \nChildren’s Hospital Association of Texas v. Azar\n, we continue to maintain reserves in the financial statements for cumulative Medicaid DSH and UC reimbursements related to our behavioral health hospitals located in Texas that amounted to $34 million as of December 31, 2024 and $31 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nNevada State Plan Amendment (\"SPA\")\n\n\nCMS initially approved an SPA in Nevada in August, 2014 and this SPA has been approved for additional state fiscal years, including the 2024 fiscal year covering the period of July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024. CMS approval for the 2025 fiscal year, which is still pending, is expected to occur.\n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $17 million and $25 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $18 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\n\nRisk Factors Related To State Supplemental Medicaid Payments:\n\n\nAs outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could cause our estimates to differ by material amounts which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\n\n\nIn April, 2016, CMS published its final Medicaid Managed Care Rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of pass-through payments (including supplemental payments) by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (“MCO”) to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the pass-through payments into value-based payment structures, delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a MCO contract. Since we are unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule, we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. In November, 2020, CMS issued a final rule permitting pass-through supplemental provider payments during a time-limited period when states transition populations or services from fee-for-service Medicaid to managed care.\n\n\nWe receive Medicaid SDP payments from MCOs authorized by CMS under 42 CFR § 438.6(c). Consistent with capitated rates paid by Medicaid state agencies to MCO’s for managing Medicaid beneficiary lives under a risk-based arrangement, SDP program related capitated rates must also be developed by the state in accordance with actuarial soundness standards noted at 42 CFR § 438.4 and non-compliance could result in a reduction to SDP payment levels. In general, Medicaid SDP payments under 42 CFR § 438.6(c) are subject to annual CMS approval via the submission of a preprint application by a state agency which provides details of the SDP payment methodology and conformity with the applicable federal regulations. CMS SDP preprint approval, and the timing of such approval, if it occurs, are not certain which can affect the both the SDP payment level and timing of SDP revenue recorded by us.\n\n\nWe incur Provider Taxes imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services that are used by respective states to finance the non-federal share of SDP’s (or other Medicaid supplemental payment programs). Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid supplemental payment programs. States are subject to CMS both concurrent and retrospective review for their compliance with the applicable Provider Tax regulations and related federal statute. If CMS determines Provider Taxes used by a state Medicaid program to finance the non-federal share of a SDP (or other Medicaid supplemental payment programs) are not in compliance with the\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\napplicable Provider Tax regulations and related federal statute, Company SDP payments (and other Medicaid supplemental payments) could be subject to recoupment by the respective state agency when non-compliance is determined by CMS to exist.\n\n\nWe believe that the SDP (and other state supplemental payment) programs are designed by each state to be in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations and federal statutes. However, we are unable to provide assurance CMS will determine on a retroactive basis that a state’s SDP (or other Medicaid supplemental payment program) design and Medicaid financing structures is in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations and federal statute(s).\n\n\nOn April 22, 2024, CMS issued Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") Managed Care Access, Finance, and Quality Final Rule (“Managed Care Rule”).  CMS intends for the Managed Care Rule to:\n\n\n•\nStrengthen standard for timely access to care and states’ monitoring and enforcement efforts;\n\n\n•\nEnhance quality and fiscal and program integrity standards for state directed payments (“SDPs”);\n\n\n•\nSpecify the scope of in lieu of services and settings to better address health-related social needs;\n\n\n•\nFurther specify medical loss ratio requirements, and;\n\n\n•\nEstablish a quality rating system for Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans.\n\n\nThe SDP provisions included in the Managed Care Rule:\n\n\n•\nRequires that provider payment levels for state directed payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, and the professional services at an academic medical center not exceed the average commercial rate;\n\n\n•\nProhibits the use of post-payment reconciliation processes for state directed payments that are based on fee schedules;\n\n\n•\nMakes explicit in regulation the existing requirement that state directed payments must comply with all federal laws concerning funding sources of the non-federal share, and;\n\n\n•\nRequires that states ensure each provider receiving a state directed payment attest that it does not participate in any arrangement that holds taxpayers harmless for the cost of a tax. CMS concurrently released an informational bulletin regarding CMS’ exercise of enforcement discretion until calendar year 2028 for existing health-care related tax programs with certain hold-harmless arrangements involving the redistribution of Medicaid payments.\n\n\nAs disclosed herein, we receive a significant amount of Medicaid and Medicaid managed care revenue from both base payments and supplemental payments. Although we are unable to estimate the impact of the Managed Care Rule on our future results of operations, if implemented as proposed, Managed Care Rule related changes could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\n\n\nFuture changes to the terms and conditions of the various programs outlined above could materially reduce our net benefit derived from the programs which could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. In addition, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\n\n\nA 6.2% increase to the Medicaid Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”) was included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The CAA of 2023 provided for the transitional reduction of the 6.2% enhanced FMAP during 2023 to 5.0% during the second quarter, 2.5% during the third quarter and 1.5% during the fourth quarter of 2023. The impact of the enhanced FMAP Medicaid supplemental and DSH payments are reflected in our financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n\nHITECH Act:\n In July 2010, HHS published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate. Our acute care hospitals qualified for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use” criteria. The government’s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.\n\n\nAll of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the 2019 IPPS final rule, CMS overhauled the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program to focus on interoperability, improve flexibility, relieve burden and place emphasis on measures that require the electronic exchange of health information between providers and patients. We can provide no assurance that the changes will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\n\n\nManaged Care:\n A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payers than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payers including managed care companies.\n\n\nCommercial Insurance:\n Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payers and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payer.\n\n\nCommercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.\n\n\nSurprise Billing Interim Final Rule: \nOn September 30, 2021, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury, along with the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”), released an interim final rule with comment period, entitled “Requirements Related to Surprise Billing; Part II.” This rule is related to Title I (the “No Surprises Act”) of Division BB of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and establishes new protections from surprise billing and excessive cost sharing for consumers receiving health care items/services. It implements additional protections against surprise medical bills under the No Surprises Act, including provisions related to the independent dispute resolution (\"IDR\") process, good faith estimates for uninsured (or self-pay) individuals, the patient-provider dispute resolution process, and expanded rights to external review. On February 28, 2022, a district judge in the Eastern District of Texas invalidated portions of the rule governing aspects of the IDR process. In light of this decision, the government issued a final rule on August 19, 2022 eliminating the rebuttable presumption in favor of the qualifying payment amount by the IDR entity and providing additional factors the IDR entity should consider when choosing between two competing offers. CMS regulations and guidance implementing the IDR process has been subject to a significant amount of provider-initiated litigation. As a result, portions of those regulations and guidance materials have been vacated by a federal district court, causing CMS to, on several occasions, pause and resume IDR process operations, causing significant delay in the processing of claims. On October 27, 2023, HHS, the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, and OPM issued a proposed rule intended to improve the functioning of the federal IDR process. Additionally, arguments made by the plaintiffs in such litigation have included allegations that CMS’s regulations and guidance materials are favorable to payers. We cannot predict the impact of the proposed rule on our operations at this time.\n\n\nOther Sources:\n Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.\n\n\nHealth Care Reform:\n Listed below are the Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which have been, or are scheduled to be, implemented as a result of the Legislation.\n\n\nMedicaid Federal DSH Allotment\n \n\n\nAlthough the implementation has been delayed several times, the Legislation (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal Medicaid DSH allotment from FFY 2025 through FFY 2027. Commencing in federal fiscal year 2025, and continuing through 2027, DSH payments are scheduled to be reduced by $8 billion annually. The American Relief Act, 2025 (HR 10545, Public Law No. 118-158) enacted into law on December 21, 2024 postponed the scheduled ACA Medicaid DSH cuts that were to take effect January 1, 2025 to April 1, 2025.  The $8 billion DSH reduction for FFY 2025 will be implemented over six months rather than twelve months if not delayed further by Congressional action.\n \n\n\nValue-Based Purchasing\n\n\nThere is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndata to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.\n\n\nThe Legislation required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012. The Legislation requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. As part of the FFY 2022 IPPS final rule and FFY 2023 final rule, as discussed above, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS has implemented a budget neutral payment policy to fully offset the 2% VBP withhold during each of FFY 2022 and FFY 2023. In FFY 2024, as part of the FFY 2024 IPPS final rule, CMS removed the budget neutral policy that was in place in FFY 2022 and FFY 2023.\n\n\nHospital Acquired Conditions\n\n\nThe Legislation prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (“HAC”). Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. As part of the FFY 2023 final rule discussed above, and as a result of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, CMS suppressed all nine measures in the HAC Reduction Program for the FY 2023 program year and eliminated the HAC reduction program’s one percent payment penalty. In FFY 2024, as part of the FFY 2024 IPPS final rule, CMS eliminated the suppression of the applicable HAC measures and as a result reinstated the HAC reduction program.\n\n\nReadmission Reduction Program\n\n\nIn the Legislation, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program (“HRRP”). Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard. The HRRP currently assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\") and elective total hip arthroplasty (\"THA\") and/or total knee arthroplasty (\"TKA\"), excluding planned readmissions, when compared to expected rates. In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (\"CABG\") surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. To account for excess readmissions, an applicable hospital's base operating DRG payment amount is adjusted for each discharge occurring during the fiscal year. Readmissions payment adjustment factors can be no more than a 3% reduction. As part of the FFY 2023 IPPS final rule discussed above, CMS modified all of the condition-specific readmission measures to include an adjustment for patient history of COVID-19 for FFY 2024.\n\n\nAccountable Care Organizations\n\n\nThe Legislation requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. CMS also developed and implemented more advanced ACO payment models that require ACOs to assume greater risk for attributed beneficiaries. Through various subsidiaries, we participate in ACOs in many of our acute care hospital markets.\n\n\nInfectious Disease Outbreaks, Pandemics, or Other Public Health Emergencies or Crisis\n \n\n\nOur business and financial results may be harmed by an international, national or localized outbreak of a highly contagious or epidemic disease, including but not limited to, COVID-19 or similar corona viruses, Ebola or Zika, may put stress on the capacity of all or a part of our health care facilities, could result in an abnormally high demand for health care services, require that resources be diverted from one part of operations to another part, or disrupt the supply chain for equipment and supplies necessary for operations. In addition, unaffected individuals may decide to defer elective procedures or otherwise avoid medical treatment, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues.\n\n\nIn addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare program and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmade, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.\n\n\nFinally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results.\n\n\nOther Operating Results\n\n\nInterest Expense\n\n\nAs reflected on the schedule below, interest expense was  $186 million during 2024 and $207 million during 2023 (amounts in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolving credit & demand notes (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n18,770\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n23,139\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranche A term loan, extinguished (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n113,934\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n155,673\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranche A term loan, 2029 (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20,001\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$800 million, 2.65% Senior Notes due 2030 (b.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,426\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,426\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$700 million, 1.65% Senior Notes due 2026 (c.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,725\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,725\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 2.65% Senior Notes due 2032 (d.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,380\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,380\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029 (e.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,113\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 5.05% Senior Notes due 2034 (f.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,705\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal - revolving credit, term loan A and Senior Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n212,054\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n225,343\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of financing fees\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,021\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,035\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther combined interest expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,381\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,290\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitalized interest on major projects\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(38,922\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(24,422\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,425\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(572\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n186,109\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n206,674\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(a.)\nOn September 26, 2024, we entered into the tenth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended and restated at various times from March, 2011 to June, 2022 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The tenth amendment provides for, among other things, the following: (i) an extension of the maturity date to September 26, 2029; (ii) a $100 million increase in the revolving credit facility to $1.3 billion of aggregate borrowing capacity (which as of December 31, 2024, had $1.17 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity, net of $130 million of borrowings outstanding and $3 million of letters of credit), and; (iii) a $1.0 billion reduction in the outstanding borrowings pursuant to the tranche A term loan facility, to $1.2 billion from $2.2 billion previously, utilizing the proceeds generated from the September, 2024, issuance of the below-mentioned senior notes due in 2029 and 2034.\n\n\n(b.)\nIn September, 2020, we completed the offering of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.65% Senior Notes due in 2030.  \n\n\n(c.)\nIn August, 2021, we completed the offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.65% Senior Notes due in 2026.\n\n\n(d.)\nIn August, 2021, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.65% Senior Notes due in 2032.\n\n\n(e.)\nOn September 26, 2024, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due in 2029.\n\n\n(f.)\nOn September 26, 2024, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.050% Senior Notes due in 2034.\n\n\nInterest expense decreased by $21 million during 2024 to $186 million as compared to $207 million during 2023. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) a net $13 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes, resulting from a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (4.65% during 2024 as compared to 4.8% during 2023), as well as a decrease in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings ($4.47 billion during 2024 as compared to $4.63 billion during 2023); (ii) a $15 million decrease resulting from an increase in capitalized interest on major projects,  partially offset by; (iii) a net $7 million increase in other combined interest expenses.\n \n\n\nThe average effective interest rate, including amortization of deferred financing costs, on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes, which amounted to approximately $4.47 billion as of 2024 and $4.63 billion as of 2023, were 4.8% during 2024 and 4.9% during 2023.\n \n\n\nProvision for Asset Impairments\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, include a pre-tax provision for asset impairment of approximately $58 million, which is included in other operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income, to write-down the asset value of Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center, a 282-bed acute care hospital located in Las Vegas, Nevada. In early 2023, as a result of various competitive pressures and operational challenges experienced in the market, which had a significant unfavorable impact on the hospital's results of operations during the past year, as well as physical plant constraints and limitations resulting from the advanced age of the facility (which opened in 1971), we announced plans to discontinue all inpatient operations by March of 2023. For a period of time, we plan to continue providing emergency department services within a portion of the existing facility while we construct a new free-standing emergency department on the hospital's campus. The provision for asset impairment reduced the asset values of the facility's real estate and equipment to their estimated fair values.\n \n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates\n\n\nThe effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n334,827\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n221,119\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,497,936\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n940,426\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provision for income taxes increased $114 million during 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $538 million increase in pre-tax income (consisting of $558 million increase in income before income taxes minus a $20 million increase in the income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests), partially offset by; (ii) a $16 million decrease in the provision for income taxes during 2024, as compared to 2023, from the net tax benefit recorded pursuant to ASU 2016-09, net of the impact of executive compensation limitations pursuant to IRC section 162(m).\n \n\n\nDue to recent guidance and enacted laws surrounding the global 15% minimum tax rate that will be effective after 2024 from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\"), as well as jurisdictions that we operate in, we anticipate adverse effects to our provision for income taxes as well as cash taxes. Currently, the United States has not enacted legislation that aligns with the OECD global minimum tax rate. We do not expect these effects to be material and will continue to monitor changes in tax policies and laws issued by the OECD and jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\n\nEffects of Inflation and Seasonality\n\n\nSeasonality\n —Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year. This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.\n\n\nInflation \n— See disclosure above in \nResults of Operations-Clinical Staffing, Physician Related Expenses and Effects of Inflation.\n \n \n\n\nLiquidity\n\n\nYear ended December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023:\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.067 billion during 2024 as compared to $1.268 million during 2023. The net increase of $799 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\n\n•\na favorable change of $472 million resulting from an increase in net income plus/minus depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, gains on sales of assets and businesses and costs related to the extinguishment of debt;\n\n\n•\na favorable change of $250 million in accounts receivable due, in part, to a decrease in our days sales outstanding as of December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, as discussed below;    \n\n\n•\na favorable change of $94 million from other working capital accounts due primarily to the timing of disbursements for certain accrued liabilities;  \n\n\n•\nan unfavorable change of $61 million in other assets and deferred charges;\n\n\n•\na favorable change of $56 million in accrued and deferred income taxes, and; \n\n\n•\n$12 million of other combined net unfavorable changes. \n\n\nDays sales outstanding (“DSO”):\n  Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the year. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at the end of the year.

We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.\n\n\nCapital Resources:\n\n\nCredit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities\n\n\nIn September, 2024, we completed the following financing transactions:\n\n\n•\nThe public offering of $500 million of aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior secured notes due on October 15, 2029 (\"2029 Notes\");\n\n\n•\nThe public offering of $500 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.050% senior secured notes due on October 15, 2034 (\"2034 Notes\");\n\n\n•\nAmended our credit agreement to:\n\n\no\nExtend the maturity date to September, 2029 (from August, 2026 previously);\n\n\no\nIncrease the revolving credit facility to $1.3 billion (from $1.2 billion previously), and;\n\n\no\nreduce the outstanding borrowings pursuant to the tranche term loan A facility by approximately $1.0 billion, to $1.2 billion, utilizing the proceeds generated from the issuance of the above-mentioned 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes.\n\n\nOn September 26, 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment (\"Tenth Amendment\") to our credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\"), dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended and restated at various times from March, 2011 to June, 2022, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Tenth Amendment provided for: (i) an extension of the maturity date to September 26, 2029; (ii) a new revolving credit facility of up to $1.3 billion (which as of December 31, 2024, had $1.17 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity, net of $130 million of outstanding borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit), and; (iii) a new replacement tranche A term loan facility (\"Tranche A Term Loan\") of up to $1.2 billion (which had $1.19 billion of outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024).\n\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Tenth Amendment, the Tranche A Term Loan provides for installment payments of $7.5 million per quarter commencing on December 31, 2024 through September 30, 2026, and $15.0 million per quarter commencing on December 31, 2026 through June 30, 2029. The unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2029 (scheduled to be $975.0 million) is payable on the September 26, 2029 scheduled maturity date of the Credit Agreement.\n\n\nRevolving credit and Tranche A Term Loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our election at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month term SOFR rate plus 1.1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.25% to 0.625%, or (2) the one, three or six month term SOFR rate plus 0.1% (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.25% to 1.625%. As of December 31, 2024, the applicable margins were 0.375% for ABR-based loans and 1.375% for SOFR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan A facilities.  The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, if sold to a receivables facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third parties) and is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.\n\n\nThe Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens, indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage. We were in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2024 (pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended on September 26, 2024) and as of December 31, 2023 (pursuant to the terms of the previous credit agreement).\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs mentioned above, on September 26, 2024, we completed the public offering of: (i) $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 4.625%, 2029 Notes, and; (ii) $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 5.050%, 2034 Notes (and together with the 2029 Notes, the \"2029 and 2034 Notes\"), each guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries that guarantee our senior secured credit facility or our other first lien obligations or any junior lien obligations (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”).  The 2029 and 2034 Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the Issuer’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-282135), including the prospectus dated September 16, 2024, and a related prospectus supplement dated September 17, 2024, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 19, 2024.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, including the above-mentioned newly issued Notes, we had combined aggregate principal of $3.0 billion from the following senior secured notes:\n\n\n•\n$700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.65% senior secured notes due in September, 2026 (\"2026 Notes\") which were issued on August 24, 2021. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable on March 1st and September 1st until the maturity date of September 1, 2026.\n\n\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior secured notes due in October, 2029 (\"2029 Notes\") which were issued on September 26, 2024. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, commencing April 15, 2025 until the maturity date of October 15, 2029.\n\n\n•\n$800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior secured notes due in October, 2030 (\"2030 Notes\") which were issued on September 21, 2020. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, until the maturity date of October 15, 2030.\n\n\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior secured notes due in January, 2032 (\"2032 Notes\") which were issued on August 24, 2021. Interest on the 2032 Notes is payable on January 15th and July 15th until the maturity date of January 15, 2032.\n\n\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.050% senior secured notes due in October, 2034 (\"2034 Notes\") which were issued on September 26, 2024. Interest on the 2034 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, commencing on April 15, 2025 until the maturity date of October 15, 2034.\n\n\nThe 2026 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2032 Notes (collectively the \"2026, 2030 and 2032 Notes\") were initially issued only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. In December, 2022, we completed a registered exchange offer in which virtually all previously outstanding 2026, 2030 and 2032 Notes were exchanged for identical 2026, 2030 and 2032 Notes that were registered under the Securities Act, and thereby became freely transferable (subject to certain restrictions applicable to affiliates and broker dealers). 2026, 2030 and 2032 Notes originally issued under Rule 144A or Regulation S that were not exchanged remain outstanding and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from registration requirements thereunder.\n\n\nThe 2026, 2030 and 2032 Notes, and the 2029 and 2034 Notes (collectively \"All the Notes\") are guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by our Subsidiary Guarantors that guarantee our Credit Agreement, or other first lien obligations or any junior lien obligations.  All the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on certain of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ assets now owned or acquired in the future by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than real property, accounts receivable sold pursuant to a Company-related receivables facility (as defined in the Indenture pursuant to which All the Notes were issued (the “Indentures”), and certain other excluded assets). The Company’s obligations with respect to All the Notes, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Guarantees, and the performance of all of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ other obligations under the Indentures, are secured equally and ratably with the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement. However, the liens on the collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will be released if: (i) All the Notes have investment grade ratings; (ii) no default has occurred and is continuing, and; (iii) the liens on the collateral securing all first lien obligations (including the Credit Agreement and All the Notes) and any junior lien obligations are released or the collateral under the Credit Agreement, any other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations is released or no longer required to be pledged. The liens on any collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will also be released if the liens on that collateral securing the Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations are released.\n\n\nAs discussed in \nNote 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust and Other Related Party Transactions\n, on December 31, 2021, we (through wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours) entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”).  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, as amended, we, among other things, transferred to the Trust, the real estate assets of Aiken Regional Medical Center (“Aiken”) and Canyon Creek Behavioral Health (“Canyon Creek”).  In connection with this transaction, Aiken and Canyon Creek (as lessees), entered into a master lease and individual property leases, as amended, (with the Trust as lessor), for initial lease terms on each property of approximately twelve years, ending on December 31, 2033.  As a result of our purchase option within the Aiken and Canyon Creek lease agreements, this asset purchase and sale transaction is accounted for as a failed sale leaseback in accordance with\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nU.S. GAAP and we have accounted for the transaction as a financing arrangement. Our lease payments payable to the Trust are recorded to interest expense and as a reduction of the outstanding financial liability, and the amount allocated to interest expense is determined based upon our incremental borrowing rate and the outstanding financial liability. In connection with this transaction, our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflect financial liabilities, which are included in debt, of approximately $74 million and $77 million, respectively.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.9 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.\n\n\nOur total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was approximately 40% at December 31, 2024 and 44% at December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\nWe expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility, which had $1.17 billion of available borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2024, or through refinancing the existing Credit Agreement; (ii) the issuance of other short-term and/or long-term debt, and/or; (iii) the issuance of equity. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available commitments under existing agreements, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\n\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had combined aggregate principal of $3.0 billion from All the Notes:\n\n\n•\n$700 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes;\n\n\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes;\n\n\n•\n$800 million aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes;\n\n\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Notes, and;\n\n\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2034 Notes.\n\n\nAll the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed pursuant to the Guarantees on a senior secured basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors.  All the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on certain of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ assets now owned or acquired in the future by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than real property, accounts receivable sold pursuant to the Company’s existing receivables facility (as defined in the Indentures pursuant to which All the Notes were issued), and certain other excluded assets). The Company’s obligations with respect to All the Notes, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Guarantees, and the performance of all of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ other obligations under the Indentures, are secured equally and ratably with the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement and All the Notes by a perfected first-priority security interest, subject to permitted liens, in the collateral owned by the Company and its Subsidiary Guarantors, whether now owned or hereafter acquired. However, the liens on the collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will be released if: (i) All the Notes have investment grade ratings; (ii) no default has occurred and is continuing, and; (iii) the liens on the collateral securing all first lien obligations (including the Credit Agreement and All the Notes) and any junior lien obligations are released or the collateral under the Credit Agreement, any other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations is released or no longer required to be pledged. The liens on any collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will also be released if the liens on that collateral securing the Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations are released.\n\n\nAll the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that are not and do not become Subsidiary Guarantors of All the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made, and the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Consequently, liquidating the collateral securing All the Notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on All the Notes.\n \n\n\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our Credit Agreement and All the Notes contain restrictions on our ability to incur liens to secure additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness secured by liens that rank equally with All the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share\n \n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nratably with holders of All the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to holders of All the Notes.\n\n\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of All the Notes and the incurrence of the Guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, All the Notes or the Guarantees (or the grant of collateral securing any such obligations) could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued All the Notes or incurred the Guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) under certain circumstances received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing All the Notes or incurring the Guarantees.\n\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\n\nThe following tables include summarized financial information of Universal Health Services, Inc. and the other obligors in respect of debt issued by Universal Health Services, Inc. The summarized financial information of each obligor group is presented on a combined basis with balances and transactions within the obligor group eliminated. Investments in and the equity in earnings of non-guarantor subsidiaries, which would otherwise be consolidated in accordance with GAAP, are excluded from the below summarized financial information pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 13-01.\n\n\nThe summarized balance sheet information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Universal Health Services, Inc. is presented in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,279,988\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,292,716\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoncurrent assets (1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,214,924\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,876,623\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,870,563\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,786,642\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoncurrent liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,451,167\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,728,371\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to non-guarantors\n\n\n$\n\n\n912,958\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n913,481\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Includes goodwill of $3,262 million and $3,267 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summarized results of operations information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Universal Health Services, Inc. is presented in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTwelve Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTwelve Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,642,381\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,454,260\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating charges\n\n\n \n\n\n11,200,769\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,416,176\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n248,568\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n277,521\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n(3,186\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,996\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n$\n\n\n920,944\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n556,423\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliates Whose Securities Collateralize the Senior Secured Notes\n\n\nAll the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by, among other things, pledges of the capital stock of our subsidiaries held by us or by our secured Guarantors, in each case other than certain excluded assets and subject to permitted liens.  Such collateral securities are secured equally and ratably with our and the Guarantors’ obligations under our Credit Agreement.  For a list of our subsidiaries the capital stock of which has been pledged to secure All the Notes, see Exhibit 22.1 to this Report.\n\n\nUpon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the indentures governing All the Notes, subject to the terms of the Security Agreement relating to All the Notes provide for (among other available remedies) the foreclosure upon and sale of the Collateral (including the pledged stock) and the distribution of the net proceeds of any such sale to the holders of All the Notes, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the holders of any other permitted first priority secured obligations on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior liens on the collateral.\n\n\nNo appraisal of the value of the collateral securities has been made, and the value of the collateral securities in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Consequently, liquidating the collateral securities securing All the Notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on All the Notes.\n\n\nThe security agreement relating to All the Notes provides that the representative of the lenders under our Credit Agreement will initially control actions with respect to that collateral and, consequently, exercise of any right, remedy or power with respect to enforcing interests in or realizing upon such collateral will initially be at the direction of the representative of the lenders.\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNo trading market exists for the capital stock pledged as collateral.\n\n\nThe assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial information of Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\n\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $154 million consisting of: (i) $130 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $24 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.\n \n\n\nObligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $919 million as of December 31, 2024. The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. In addition, we lease certain hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”) with terms scheduled to expire in 2026, 2033 and 2040. These leases contain various renewal options, as disclosed in \nNote 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust and Other Related Party Transactions\n.

We have the right to repay borrowings upon short notice and without penalty, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. \n\n\n(c)\nOur share of the estimated construction cost of two behavioral health care facilities scheduled to be completed in 2025 that, subject to approval of certain regulatory conditions, we are required to build pursuant to joint-venture agreements with third parties. In addition, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2024. Because we can terminate substantially all of the construction contracts related to the various other projects at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the table above.    \n\n\n(d)\nConsists of: (i) $183 million related to the ongoing operation of an electronic health records application and purchase and implementation of a revenue cycle and other applications for our facilities; (ii) $85 million related to the development, implementation and operation of an enterprise resource planning application; (iii) $61 million in healthcare infrastructure in Washington D.C. in connection with various agreements with the District of Columbia, as discussed below; (iv) $52 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities; (v) $43 million for administrative software applications, and; (vi) $12 million for other software applications. \n\n\n(e)\nReflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2024 as discussed in \nNote 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n. Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options. In connection with these operating lease commitments, our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 includes right of use assets amounting to $419 million and aggregate operating lease liabilities of $451 million ($75 million included in current liabilities and $376 million included in noncurrent liabilities).  \n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(f)\nConsists of $133 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2080), as disclosed in \nNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n, and $26 million of estimated future payments related to other retirement plan liabilities ($23 million of liabilities recorded in other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2024 in connection with these retirement plans).\n\n\n(g)\nConsists of accrued and unpaid estimated claims expense incurred in connection with our commercial health insurers and self-insured employee benefit plans.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the total net accrual for our self-insured professional and general liability claims was $487 million, of which $85 million is included in other current liabilities and $402 million is included in other non-current liabilities. We exclude the $487 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments. Please see \nSelf-Insured/Other Insurance Risks\n above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.\n\n\nDuring 2020, we entered into various agreements with the District of Columbia (the “District”) related to the development, leasing and operation of an acute care hospital (that is expected to be completed and opened in the Spring of 2025) and certain other facilities/structures on land owned by the District (“District Facilities”).  The agreements contemplate that we will serve as manager for development and construction of the District Facilities on behalf of the District, with a projected aggregate cost of approximately $439 million, approximately $344 million of which was incurred as of December 31, 2024, which is being entirely funded by the District. Upon completion of the District Facilities, we will lease the District Facilities for a nominal rental amount for a period of 75 years and are obligated to operate the District Facilities during the lease term. We have certain lease termination rights in connection with the District Facilities beginning on the tenth anniversary of the lease commencement date for various and decreasing amounts as provided for in the agreements. Additionally, any time after the 10\nth\n anniversary of the lease term, we have a right to purchase the District Facilities for a price equal to the greater of fair market value of the District Facilities or the amount necessary to defease the bonds issued by the District to fund the construction of the District Facilities. The lease agreement also entitles the District to participation rent should certain specified earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization thresholds be achieved by the acute care hospital. Additionally, we have committed to expend no less than $75 million, over a projected 12-year period, in healthcare infrastructure including expenditures related to the District Facilities as well as other healthcare related expenditures in certain specified areas of Washington, D.C. This financial commitment is included in “Purchase and other obligations” as reflected on the contractual obligations table above.  Pursuant to the agreements, the District is entitled to certain termination fees and other amounts as specified in the agreements in the event we, within certain specified periods of time, cease to operate the acute care hospital or there is a transfer of control of us or our subsidiary operating the hospital.",
