  "item1": "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these businesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level activities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and small. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done. \nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support the creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program.\n \nGoogle Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features to help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\n4.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\nWe believe AI is a profound platform shift, one that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world, and to our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a decade and making them available to our users. \n In 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of Gemini, our natively multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and video. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and services that are helping people everyday. Today, all seven of our two billion-user products — Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and YouTube — are using Gemini.\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at the forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI development platform, world-class models, as well as assistive agents and applications.\nWe believe AI has the potential to solve important societal, scientific, and engineering challenges. For example, in 2020, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we introduced AlphaFold 3, built on the previous models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in life's processes. \nWe are focused on transforming our products to provide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. \nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized infrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\nWe are driving efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improvements. For example, since we started serving AI Overviews to our users, we have significantly lowered machine costs and latency through hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AI-optimized infrastructure allows us to use, and offer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). \nOur teams across Alphabet leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and announced, to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future capabilities of a universal AI assistant and Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as an experimental extension.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles. \nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Google’s latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generative AI models. Gemini for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write, document, test, and operate software as well as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most helpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down concepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a video and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps users understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing relevant quotes. We are embedding the power of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, the Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Additionally, we are using Gemini to improve recommendations on YouTube. We also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses — and we \n5.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nmake that even easier with AI. For example, advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads to produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns, and Demand Gen helps them reach their target audiences.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built with Gemini Nano, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as Gemini on Pixel, Pixel Screenshots, and Pixel Studio. Our Android and Chrome operating systems enable users to access Gemini, and other Google AI features throughout their day. For example, with Circle to Search built directly into the Android experience, users can search anything they see on their phone using a simple gesture.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. Our acquisitions of YouTube and Android and subsequent launch of Chrome have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. In Other Bets, our fully autonomous driving technology company, Waymo, is now providing fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services to customers in multiple cities.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the application of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. \nAs we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, applying privacy technologies like on-device processing, giving people tools to control their experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. While Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical advancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller screens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search modalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. Large language models have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the types of questions users can ask, and the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for. We are now using Gemini customized for Google Search to provide our users an improved Search experience, and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries, reaching more than one billion users.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, \n6.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nreading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow We Make Money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n•\nPerformance advertising\n creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n•\nBrand advertising\n helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns. \nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, including:\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, \nwhich primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms\n, which\n \nprimarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n•\ndevices,\n which\n \nprimarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\nGoogle Cloud\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n•\nAI-optimized Infrastructure:\n provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \n•\nDeveloper Platform:\n provides developers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generative AI models. We offer widely used first-party, third-party, and open models along with services such as vector search, grounding, and distillation to further improve the cost and quality of models.\n•\nCybersecurity:\n provides AI powered cybersecurity solutions to help customers analyze, detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\n7.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n•\nData and Analytics:\n provides a variety of different types of databases — relational, key-value, and in-memory — to store and manage data for different types of applications and deliver data to AI agents. Our data platform also unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that helps users analyze data using AI models across any cloud.\n•\nApplications:\n offers a broad applications portfolio, including Gemini for Google Cloud and Gemini for Google Workspace, as well as purpose-built agents for Search and our Customer Engagement Suite. AI has been used in Google Workspace for years to improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Now, Gemini for Google Workspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\nOther Bets\n Across Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries, including transportation and health technology. Alphabet’s investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet services.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including but not limited to, from:\n•\ngeneral purpose search engines and information services;\n•\nvertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries on topics such as those related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n•\nonline advertising platforms and networks, i\nncluding online shopping and streaming services;\n•\nother forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n•\ndigital content and application platform providers;\n•\nproviders of enterprise cloud services;\n•\ndevelopers and providers of AI products and services;\n•\ncompanies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms;\n•\nproviders of digital video services; \n•\nsocial networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines;\n•\nproviders of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \n•\ndigital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n•\nusers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n•\nadvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n•\ncontent providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n8.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nFor additional information about competition, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nOur environmental strat\negy has two key pillars, supported by our dedication to accessible information and technological innovation:\n•\nOur products: We are empowering people with information about the environmental impacts of their choices.\n•\nOur operations: We are working to drive sustainability and efficiency across our operations and value chain.\nThrough our products, we have an aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. \nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. To make progress toward this effort, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (compared to our 2019 base year) by 2030, and we plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.\nOur primary approach to reducing our Scope 2 emissions is through the procurement of carbon-free energy (CFE). In 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 CFE every hour of every day on every grid where we operate by 2030. In 2023, we began implementing our carbon removals strategy, and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships and have started contracting for carbon removal credits.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path to net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will require us to navigate significant uncertainty, including the uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict. In addition, solutions for some key global challenges do not currently exist, and will depend heavily on the development and improvement of new technologies by us and by the energy sector. As our business and industry continue to evolve, we expect our total GHG emissions to rise before dropping toward our absolute emissions reduction target.\nFor additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our work on sustainability and efficiency, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and perform at a high level. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain key talent, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality training and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-–ranging from courses for new managers, to learning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Alphabet had 183,323 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen appropriate we partner with outside companies on a contractual basis to provide a specialized service or to temporarily cover a short-term need. The employees of our suppliers and staffing partners — vendors and temporary staff, respectively — and independent contractors who are self-employed, make up our extended workforce. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and regulatory developments in the U.S. and internationally. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face increasingly heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and \n9.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nregulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to AI; competition; consumer protection; content moderation; data privacy and security; news publications; and sustainability and other social matters, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions and investigations, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world. As we have seen in recent years, different laws and regulations on the same topic may not always have the same requirements, and even when requirements overlap, the rules are not always consistently implemented, interpreted, and enforced from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services, cause us to change our business models and operations, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nF\nor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors; Trends in Our Business and Financial \nEffect\n in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor.

Discussion of 2023 results compared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and \nNote 15\n of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\n•\nUsers' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.\n•\nUsers continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop, such as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n•\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our products and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.\n•\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. \nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \n30.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n•\nThe revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics than our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n•\nAs we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesse\ns. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024, our i\nnvestment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important elements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.\n•\nWe continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nOur employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information, see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nchanges in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \n•\nnew product, service, and market launches; and\n31.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n•\nseasonality.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), other sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \n•\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n•\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:\n•\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n•\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n•\nchanges in device mix;\n•\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and\n•\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n•\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n•\nother products and services.\n32.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and the timing of product launches.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n•\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n•\nother enterprise services.\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\nOther Bets\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet services.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n•\nTAC includes: \n◦\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and\n◦\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n•\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\n◦\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n◦\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n◦\nemployee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support;\n◦\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n◦\nother technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\n33.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n•\ndepreciation;\n•\nemployee compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; and \n•\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n•\nemployee compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and\n•\nspend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n•\nemployee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; \n•\nexpenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \n•\nthird-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net \nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 as well as Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n \nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nFor additional information, including a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n34.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results (in millions, except for per share information and percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nConsolidated revenues\n$\n307,394 \n$\n350,018 \n$\n42,624 \n14 \n%\nChange in consolidated constant currency revenues\n(1)\n15 \n%\nCost of revenues\n$\n133,332 \n$\n146,306 \n$\n12,974 \n10 \n%\nOperating expenses\n$\n89,769 \n$\n91,322 \n$\n1,553 \n2 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n84,293 \n$\n112,390 \n$\n28,097 \n33 \n%\nOperating margin\n27 \n%\n32 \n%\n5 \n%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n1,424 \n$\n7,425 \n$\n6,001 \n421 \n%\nNet income\n$\n73,795 \n$\n100,118 \n$\n26,323 \n36 \n%\nDiluted EPS\n(2)\n$\n5.80 \n$\n8.04 \n$\n2.24 \n39 \n%\n(1)\n    See \"Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\" below for details relating to our use of constant currency information. \n(2)    \nFor additional information on the calculation of diluted EPS, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nRevenues were\n $350.0 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services revenues of $32.4 billion, or 12%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $10.1 billion, or 31%.\n•\nTotal constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 15% year over year.\n•\nCost of revenues wa\ns $146.3 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by increases in content acquisition costs, TAC, and depreciation expense. \n•\nOperating expenses were $91.3 billion, an increase of 2% year over year, primarily driven by increases in de\npreciation expense, \nemployee compensation expenses,\n and third-party services fees. These increases were partially offset by reductions in charges related to legal and other matters and charges related to our office space optimization efforts. The overall increase in employee compensation expenses was partially offset by a reduction in employee severance and related charges.\nOther Information:\n•\nDividend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion, respectively, totaling $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nRepurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $11.9 billion and $50.2 billion, respectively, totaling $62.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nEmployee severance and related charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $1.0 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Office space charges, including accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation, for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $796 million, a decrease of $1.3 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Substantially all of these charges were included in Alphabet-level activities. \n•\nOperating cash flow was $125.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nCapital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $52.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024, we had\n 183,323 employees.\n35.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nFinancial Results\nRevenues\nThe following table presents revenues by type (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2024\nGoogle Search & other\n$\n175,033 \n$\n198,084 \nYouTube ads\n31,510 \n36,147 \nGoogle Network\n31,312 \n30,359 \nGoogle advertising\n237,855 \n264,590 \nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\n34,688 \n40,340 \nGoogle Services total\n272,543 \n304,930 \nGoogle Cloud\n33,088 \n43,229 \nOther Bets\n1,527 \n1,648 \nHedging gains (losses)\n236 \n211 \nTotal revenues\n$\n307,394 \n$\n350,018 \nGoogle Services\nGoogle advertising revenues\nGoogle Search & other\nGoogle Search & other revenues increased $23.1 billion from 2023 to 2024. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.\nYouTube ads\nYouTube ads revenues increased $4.6 billion from 2023 to 2024. The growth was driven by our brand advertising products followed by our direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.\nGoogle Network\nGoogle Network revenues decreased $953 million from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in Google Ad Manager and AdMob revenues. Additionally, Google Network revenues were adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMonetization Metrics\nThe following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks and cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a percentage, from 2023 to 2024:\nGoogle Search & other\nPaid clicks change\n5 \n%\nCost-per-click change\n7 \n%\nGoogle Network\nImpressions change\n(11)\n%\nCost-per-impression change\n10 \n%\nChanges in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.\nChanges in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n36.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $5.7 billion from 2023 to 2024. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues, largely from growth in the number of paid subscribers for YouTube services followed by Google One. \nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased\n $10.1 billion \nfrom 2023 to 2024 primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure services.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the addresses of our customers:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nUnited States\n47 \n%\n49 \n%\nEMEA\n30 \n%\n29 \n%\nAPAC\n17 \n%\n16 \n%\nOther Americas\n6 \n%\n6 \n%\nHedging gains (losses)\n0 \n%\n0 \n%\nFor additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\nInternational revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n37.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nYear Ended December 31,\nLess FX Effect\nConstant Currency Revenues\nAs Reported\nLess Hedging Effect\nLess FX Effect\nConstant Currency Revenues\n2023\n2024\nUnited States\n$\n146,286 \n$\n170,447 \n$\n0 \n$\n170,447 \n17 \n%\n0 \n%\n17 \n%\nEMEA\n91,038 \n102,127 \n41 \n102,086 \n12 \n%\n0 \n%\n12 \n%\nAPAC\n51,514 \n56,815 \n(1,369)\n58,184 \n10 \n%\n(3)\n%\n13 \n%\nOther Americas\n18,320 \n20,418 \n(1,608)\n22,026 \n11 \n%\n(9)\n%\n20 \n%\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect\n307,158 \n349,807 \n(2,936)\n352,743 \n14 \n%\n(1)\n%\n15 \n%\nHedging gains (losses)\n236 \n211 \nTotal revenues\n(1)\n$\n307,394 \n$\n350,018 \n$\n352,743 \n14 \n%\n0 \n%\n(1)\n%\n15 \n%\n(1)\nTotal constant currency revenues of $352.7 billion for 2024 increased $45.6 billion compared to $307.2 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for 2023.\nEMEA revenue growth was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as the effect of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the British pound and the euro.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nTAC\n$\n50,886 \n$\n54,900 \nOther cost of revenues\n82,446 \n91,406 \nTotal cost of revenues\n$\n133,332 \n$\n146,306 \nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n43 \n%\n42 \n%\nCost of revenues increased\n $13.0 billion from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $9.0 billion and $4.0 billion, res\npectively.\nThe increase in TAC from 2023 to 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.4% to 20.7% from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from 2023 to 2024.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, and other technical infrastructure operations costs.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n38.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nResearch and development expenses\n$\n45,427 \n$\n49,326 \nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues\n15 \n%\n14 \n%\nR&D expenses increased \n$3.9 billion\n from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by increases in employee compensation expenses of $1.5 billion, depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, and third-party services fees of $698 million, partially offset by a reduction in charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $640 million. The increase in employee compensation expenses was primarily driven by a $1.3 billion increase in SBC expenses, which includes the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by a $537 million decrease in severance and related charges.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nSales and marketing expenses\n$\n27,917 \n$\n27,808 \nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues\n9 \n%\n8 \n%\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $109 million from 2023 to 2024, due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents general and administrative expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n16,425 \n$\n14,188 \nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues\n5 \n%\n4 \n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased \n$2.2 billion\n from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in charges related to legal and other matters of $1.3 billion and a decrease in employee compensation expenses of $285 million, primarily due to a decrease in average headcount, in addition to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. \nSegment Profitability\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.

The net gains on equity securities were primarily due to net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions, partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities due to market-driven changes. Foreign currency exchange net losses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to prior year losses in unhedged currencies.\nIn January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our investment following an observable transaction in January 2025. \nFor additional information, see Note 3 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n$\n85,717 \n$\n119,815 \nProvision for income taxes\n$\n11,922 \n$\n19,697 \nEffective tax rate\n13.9 \n%\n16.4 \n%\nThe effective tax rate increased from 2023 to 2024.

Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.\nThe OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. \nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had $95.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities.

The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n101,746 \n$\n125,299 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(27,063)\n$\n(45,536)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(72,093)\n$\n(79,733)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we generate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2023 to 2024 \ndue to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2023 to 2024\n primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities. The increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driven by investments in technical infrastructure. \nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2023 to 2024\n due to dividend payments and net payments related to stock-based award activities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments.\n41.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect exist\ning cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n•\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and building construction; and\n•\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nAssets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including assets in the process of construction or assembly, and consists primarily of technical infrastructure. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install servers and network equipment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, we spent $32.3 billion and $52.5 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We \nexpect to increase, relative to 2024, our i\nnvestment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was $11.9 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively.\nLeases \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, we recognized additional operating lease assets of $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, and additional finance lease assets of $564 million and $313 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.8 years, was $17.0 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-term, and total future lease payments under finance leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years, was $1.9 billion, of which $257 million is short-term. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease payments of $773 million and $6.5 billion, respectively, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2028 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were $504 million and $444 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we ha\nd $2.3 billion \nof short-term commercial paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion with short-term and long-term future interest payments of $197 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, \n$4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability  goals\n. No amounts \nhave been borrowed under the credit facilities. \nFor additional information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n42.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired \n379 million\n shares for \n$62.0 billion\n.\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n$44.7 billion\n remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n78\n$\n9,316 \n73\n$\n11,855 \nClass C share repurchases\n450\n52,868 \n306\n50,192 \nTotal share repurchases\n(1)\n528\n$\n62,184 \n379\n$\n62,047 \n(1)         \nShares repurchased include unsettled repurchases.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDividend Program\nDuring the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were \n$3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion\n for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. \nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018, and 2019, the European Commission (EC) announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. \nIn September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending.\nIn September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld the €2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.\nIn September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.\nWe included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTaxes\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had income taxes payable of $2.7 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is due in 2025. We also had long-term taxes payable of $8.8 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $55.4 billion, of which $32.5 billion was short-term.\n These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as \nthe non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements \n43.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nwith variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-marketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the measurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. performance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the asset.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \n44.  \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.",
