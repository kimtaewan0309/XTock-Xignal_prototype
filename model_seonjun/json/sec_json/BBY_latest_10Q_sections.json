Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025 (including the information presented therein under \nRisk Factors\n), as well as our other reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K and other publicly available information. All amounts herein are unaudited.\nOverview\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of tech expertise and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. \nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business. The International segment is comprised of all our operations in Canada.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\nComparable Sales\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of certain periodic warranty-related profit-share revenue, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only) and the impact of the 53\nrd\n week (applicable in 53-week fiscal years only). Comparable sales is based on our fiscal calendar and is not adjusted to align calendar weeks. All periods presented apply this methodology consistently.\nConsistent with our comparable sales policy, revenue from Best Buy Express locations rebranded as a result of our previously announced collaboration with Bell Canada is excluded from our comparable sales calculation until locations have been operating for at least 14 full months. \nWe believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\n18\nTable\n of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, consolidated adjusted operating income rate, consolidated adjusted effective tax rate and consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts and financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on disposals of subsidiaries and certain investments, amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. We provide reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures that enable investors to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\nIn our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use the term “constant currency,” which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting consolidated adjusted operating income, consolidated adjusted effective tax rate and consolidated adjusted diluted EPS in the presented periods.\nTariffs\nWe continue to face significant uncertainty regarding the scope, timing and magnitude of tariffs that may affect the products we sell and the consequent financial impact on our business. In conjunction with our vendors, we continue to seek to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our business and our customers.\nWhile we directly import approximately 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, the complex global supply chain for consumer electronics is heavily reliant on vendor imports from China, which we estimate make up approximately 30% to 35% of the products we purchase, compared to 55% disclosed within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. This is the result of vendors using production capabilities in multiple countries and leveraging their ability to flex sourcing options as the environment evolves. We estimate approximately 25% of the products we purchase are from the U.S. and Mexico, with the remaining amount from other countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia.\n19\nTable\n of Contents\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nSelected consolidated financial data was as follows ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nRevenue\n$\n9,438 \n$\n9,288 \n$\n18,205 \n$\n18,135 \nRevenue % change\n1.6 \n%\n(3.1)\n%\n0.4 \n%\n(4.8)\n%\nComparable sales % change\n1.6 \n%\n(2.3)\n%\n0.4 \n%\n(4.2)\n%\nGross profit\n$\n2,194 \n$\n2,186 \n$\n4,243 \n$\n4,250 \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n(1)\n23.2 \n%\n23.5 \n%\n23.3 \n%\n23.4 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\")\n$\n1,829 \n$\n1,810 \n$\n3,550 \n$\n3,547 \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n(1)\n19.4 \n%\n19.5 \n%\n19.5 \n%\n19.6 \n%\nRestructuring charges\n$\n114 \n$\n(7)\n$\n223 \n$\n8 \nOperating income\n$\n251 \n$\n383 \n$\n470 \n$\n695 \nOperating income as a % of revenue\n2.7 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n3.8 \n%\nNet earnings\n$\n186 \n$\n291 \n$\n388 \n$\n537 \nDiluted EPS\n$\n0.87 \n$\n1.34 \n$\n1.82 \n$\n2.47 \n(1)\nBecause retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers’ corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and SG&A, refer to Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025.\nIn the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2026, we generated $9.4 billion and $18.2 billion in revenue, respectively, and our comparable sales grew 1.6% and 0.4%, respectively, driven by a mix of new technology innovation, our continued focus on omni-channel customer experience and strong vendor partnerships. Comparable sales increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, primarily from comparable sales growth in gaming, computing and mobile phones, partially offset by comparable sales declines in home theater, appliances, tablets and drones. Comparable sales increased in the first six months of fiscal 2026, primarily from comparable sales growth in computing, gaming and mobile phones, partially offset by comparable sales declines in home theater and appliances.\nRestructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 were primarily associated with a labor and store optimization restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2026. Restructuring charges in the first six months of fiscal 2026 also included charges primarily associated with a restructuring initiative focused on optimizing our Best Buy Health business that commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Refer to Note 2, \nRestructuring\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. \nOperating income rate decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2026, primarily due to higher restructuring charges.\nDiluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2026, primarily due to lower operating income driven by higher restructuring charges.\nRevenue and gross profit rate changes in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 were driven by both our Domestic and International segments. Changes in our SG&A rate and operating income rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 were primarily driven by our International segment and Domestic segment, respectively.\nRevenue, gross profit rate and SG&A rate changes in the first six months of fiscal 2026 were primarily driven by our International segment. The change in operating income rate in the first six months of fiscal 2026 was primarily driven by our Domestic segment. \nFo\nr further discussion of our Domestic and International segments, see \nSegment Performance Summary\n, below.\n20\nTable\n of Contents\nStore Summary\nStores open by reportable segment were as follows:\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nBest Buy\n885\n890\nOutlet Centers\n23\n26\nPacific Sales\n20\n20\nYardbird\n21\n23\nTotal Domestic stores\n949\n959\nCanada Best Buy stores\n128\n129\nCanada Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores\n28\n32\nTotal International stores\n(1)\n156\n161\nTotal stores\n1,105\n1,120\n(1)\nExcludes Best Buy Express stores leased by Bell Canada.\nWe continuously monitor store performance as part of a market-driven, omnichannel strategy. As we approach the expiration of leases, we evaluate various options for each location, including whether a store should remain open. In fiscal 2026, we currently expect to reduce our traditional Domestic Best Buy store count by approximately 5 to 10 stores in the normal course of operations. We also plan to close select non-traditional Domestic store locations in conjunction with our restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2026. See Note 2, \nRestructuring\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased to $68 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $101 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to lower pre-tax income. Effective tax rate (“ETR”) increased to 26.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to 25.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to decreased tax benefits from resolutions of tax matters and stock-based compensation, as well as increased U.S. taxes from sourcing operations, partially offset by discrete tax impacts of the restructuring charges and associated exit of a component of our Best Buy Health business.\nIncome tax expense decreased to $87 million in the first six months of fiscal 2026 compared to $181 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025, primarily due to the discrete tax impacts of the restructuring charges and associated exit of a component of our Best Buy Health business, as well as lower pre-tax income. ETR decreased to 18.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2026 compared to 25.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2025, primarily due to the discrete tax impacts of the restructuring charges and associated exit of a component of our Best Buy Health business, partially offset by decreased tax benefits from resolutions of tax matters and green energy incentives. See Note 2, \nRestructuring\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nOur tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual ETR, adjusted for discrete and unusual and infrequent items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. We update our estimate of the annual ETR each quarter, and we make a cumulative adjustment if our estimated tax rate changes. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual ETR are subject to variation due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast our pre-tax and taxable income and loss by jurisdiction, tax audit developments, recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in laws or regulations, and expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our ETR can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax earnings. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible losses on our ETR is greater when our pre-tax earnings are lower.\n21\nTable\n of Contents\nSegment Performance Summary\nDomestic Segment\nSelected financial data for the Domestic segment was as follows ($ in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nRevenue\n$\n8,698 \n$\n8,623 \n$\n16,825 \n$\n16,826 \nRevenue % change\n0.9 \n%\n(3.0)\n%\n— \n%\n(4.9)\n%\nComparable sales % change\n(1)\n1.1 \n%\n(2.3)\n%\n0.2 \n%\n(4.3)\n%\nGross profit\n$\n2,033 \n$\n2,027 \n$\n3,941 \n$\n3,944 \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n23.4 \n%\n23.5 \n%\n23.4 \n%\n23.4 \n%\nAdjusted SG&A\n(2)\n$\n1,682 \n$\n1,663 \n$\n3,261 \n$\n3,255 \nAdjusted SG&A as a % of revenue\n(3)\n19.3 \n%\n19.3 \n%\n19.4 \n%\n19.3 \n%\nAdjusted operating income\n(2)\n$\n351 \n$\n364 \n$\n680 \n$\n689 \nAdjusted operating income as a % of revenue\n(4)\n4.0 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n4.1 \n%\nSelected Online Revenue Data\nTotal online revenue\n$\n2,856 \n$\n2,718 \n$\n5,435 \n$\n5,243 \nOnline revenue as a % of total segment revenue\n32.8 \n%\n31.5 \n%\n32.3 \n%\n31.2 \n%\nComparable online sales % change\n(1)\n5.1 \n%\n(1.6)\n%\n3.7 \n%\n(3.8)\n%\n(1)\nComparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation.\n(2)\nRepresents Domestic segment Adjusted SG&A and Domestic segment Adjusted operating income as reported in accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280)\n, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.

Adjusted effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2026, primarily due to decreased tax benefits from resolutions of tax matters and green energy incentives, as well as increased U.S. taxes from sourcing operations.\nAdjusted diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, primarily due to the decrease in adjusted earnings driven by lower adjusted operating income. Adjusted diluted EPS decreased in the first six months of fiscal 2026, primarily due to the decrease in adjusted earnings driven by lower investment income and lower adjusted operating income. The decreases in adjusted diluted EPS in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2026 were partially offset by lower diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. \n25\nTable\n of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. \nCash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):\nAugust 2, 2025\nFebruary 1, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,456\n$\n1,578\n$\n1,387\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents from February 1, 2025, was primarily due to dividend payments, capital expenditures and share repurchases, partially offset by positive cash flows from operations, primarily driven by earnings. \nThe increase in cash and cash equivalents from August 3, 2024, was primarily due to positive cash flows from operations, primarily driven by earnings, partially offset by dividend payments, capital expenditures and share repurchases.\nCash Flows\nCash flows were as follows ($ in millions):\nSix Months Ended\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n783 \n$\n817 \nInvesting activities\n(369)\n(352)\nFinancing activities\n(574)\n(557)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n5 \n(3)\nDecrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(155)\n$\n(95)\nOperating Activities\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2026 was primarily driven by the timing and volume of inventory purchases and payments and lower net earnings, partially offset by the timing of vendor funding receivables.\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in cash used in investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2026 was primarily due to the disposal of a component of our Best Buy Health business.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2026 was primarily driven by higher share repurchases.\nSources of Liquidity\nFunds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables are our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.\n26\nTable\n of Contents\nOn April 18, 2025, we entered into a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the “Five-Year Facility Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Five-Year Facility Agreement replaced the previous $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Previous Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, which was entered into April 2023 and scheduled to expire in April 2028, but was terminated on April 18, 2025. The Five-Year Facility Agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in April 2030. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Five-Year Facility Agreement as of August 2, 2025, or the Previous Facility as of February 1, 2025, or August 3, 2024.\nRestricted Cash\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our membership offerings and self-insurance liabilities. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $257 million, $290 million and $311 million as of August 2, 2025, February 1, 2025, and August 3, 2024, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash from February 1, 2025, was primarily due to releases of product protection reserves based on claims and purchasing behaviors of customers participating in our membership offerings. The decrease in restricted cash from August 3, 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in cash for self-insurance liabilities and releases of product protection reserves.\nDebt and Capital\nAs of August 2, 2025, we had $500 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028, and $650 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030. Refer to Note 6, \nDebt\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Note 8, \nDebt\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, for additional information about our outstanding debt.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nWe repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board of Directors (“Board”). The payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Our share repurchase plans are evaluated on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our liquidity needs, our stock price and the health and stability of global markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on such factors.\nOn February 28, 2022, our Board approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase program. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.\nShare repurchase and dividend activity were as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):  \nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nAugust 2, 2025\nAugust 3, 2024\nTotal cost of shares repurchased\n$\n67 \n$\n98 \n$\n167 \n$\n150 \nAverage price per share\n$\n68.65 \n$\n82.57 \n$\n66.03 \n$\n80.86 \nTotal number of shares repurchased\n0.9\n1.1\n2.5\n1.8\nRegular quarterly cash dividend per share\n$\n0.95 \n$\n0.94 \n$\n1.90 \n$\n1.88 \nCash dividends declared and paid\n$\n201 \n$\n203 \n$\n403 \n$\n405 \nThe total cost of shares repurchased decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, due to a decrease in the average price per share and a decrease in the volume of repurchases. The total cost of shares repurchased increased in the first six months of fiscal 2026, due to an increase in the volume of repurchases, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per share. \nCash dividends declared and paid decreased during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2026, due to fewer  shares outstanding, partially offset by increases in the regular quarterly cash dividend per share. \nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nOur liquidity is not dependent on the use of off-balance-sheet financing arrangements other than in connection with our $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our Five-Year Facility Agreement as of August 2, 2025, which, if drawn upon, would be included in either short-term or long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n27\nTable\n of Contents\nThere has been no material change in our contractual obligations other than in the ordinary course of business since the end of fiscal 2025. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, for additional information regarding our off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and our critical accounting estimates in Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2025.\nNew or Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of applicable new or recently issued accounting pronouncements, including our assessment of the impact on our financial statements, see Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), provide a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies.
