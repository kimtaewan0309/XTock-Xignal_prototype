The Company’s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company’s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors’ branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.\nPharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales of the Company’s products in that therapeutic category.\nThe highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company’s products as well as competitors’ products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.\nHealth Care Environment and Government Regulation\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company’s sales performance in 2024 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. In the U.S., the Executive Branch and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.\n6\nTable of Content\ns\nIn addressing global cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens’ access to appropriate health care, including medicines.\nOperating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company’s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.\nUnited States\nThe Company faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan Act), and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Additionally, increased utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program and restrictions on the Company’s ability to identify inappropriate discounts are having a negative impact on Company performance.\nIn the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.\nAdditionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care entities is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Merck’s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies, as well as governments, also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the U.S. payor market concentrates further, the Company may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors.\nLegislative Changes\nIn 2022, Congress passed the IRA, which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits, which has taken effect in 2025, and government price setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and Medicare Part B drugs starting in 2028. Government price setting may also impact pricing in the private market negatively affecting the Company’s performance. In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), selected \nJanuvia\n for the first year of the IRA’s “Drug Price Negotiation Program” (Program). Pursuant to the IRA’s Program, a government price was set for \nJanuvia\n, which will become effective on January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS announced that \nJanumet\n and \nJanumet XR\n have been selected for government price setting, which will become effective on January 1, 2027. In addition, the Company expects that \nKeytruda\n will be selected in 2026 for government price setting, which would become effective on January 1, 2028 and the Company expects that, as a result, U.S. sales of \nKeytruda\n will decline after that time. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA’s Program (see Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 10. “Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities” below). Furthermore, \n7\nTable of Content\ns\nthe Executive Branch and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs.\nThe long-term implications of the IRA remain uncertain and subject to various factors, including the manner in which HHS decides to implement the statute. Many experts and analysts, both within the industry and outside, have predicted that the law will harm innovation in the pharmaceutical industry and result in fewer new treatments being developed and approved over time. Merck is working to mitigate the potentially harmful effects that the law could have, which could include a detrimental impact on innovation. \nIn addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory c\nap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer discounts paid to Medicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates to state Medicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a result of this provision, manufacturers may have to pay state Medicaid programs more in rebates than they received on sales of particular products. This change presents a risk to Merck for drugs that have high Medicaid utilization and rebate exposure that is more than 100% of the AMP.\nThe Company also faces increasing pricing pressure in the states, which are looking to exert greater influence over the price of prescription drugs. A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. Some laws also require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical pricing and will increasingly shift to more aggressive price control tools such as Prescription Drug Affordability Boards that have the authority to conduct affordability reviews and establish upper payment limits and that Company products may be selected for such reviews. In addition, in 2024, the FDA authorized, for a two-year period, Florida’s application to import prescription drugs from Canada.\nRegulatory Changes\nThe pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls. \nEuropean Union\nEfforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in the European Union (EU). The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product’s prices in other markets (external reference pricing), or compare a product’s price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company’s drugs. Reference pricing mechanisms are usually set at the national level and can be changed pursuant to local regulations or guidance. \nSome EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans. Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class. \nThe downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State.\nAdditionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement plans vary widely from Member State to Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies or a so-called health technology assessment (HTA), in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The HTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in most EU Member States. The HTA process, which is currently governed by the national laws of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country in \n8\nTable of Content\ns\nwhich it is conducted. Ultimately, an HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. \nThe EU Health Technology Assessment Regulation 2021/2282 (HTAR) applies in 2025. This provides for the conduct of an EU level comparative Joint Clinical Assessment (JCA) of a new product versus relevant comparators identified by the EU Member States. JCAs will be carried out in parallel with the review of a marketing authorization application, so that a JCA report is available shortly after the product is authorized. The HTAR applies to all new active substance oncology products and advanced therapy medicinal products, including cell and gene therapies, beginning January 1, 2025; to new active substance orphan medicinal products beginning January 1, 2028; and to all products approved via the centralized procedure beginning in 2030.\nEU Member States remain responsible for pricing and reimbursement decisions but must take “due consideration” of JCA reports when making national market access decisions. This means that EU Member State pricing and reimbursement processes are likely to evolve and more EU Member States may use HTAs as part of their decision-making.\nThe outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will increasingly influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the market access authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of the Company’s products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force the Company to reduce its reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates. \nA negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine the Company’s ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on JCAs under the HTAR or an HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, to inform their pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.\nTo obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, the Company may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of the Company’s product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of the Company’s products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.\nJapan\nIn Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. In addition, if a Merck product has the same medical action or composition of another product that is subject to market expansion re-pricing, the Merck product could also be subject to re-pricing unless it meets exception criteria. The next government-mandated price reduction is scheduled to occur in April 2025.\nChina\nThe Company’s business in China has grown in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company’s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company’s business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company’s currently marketed products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. There have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the government’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. A new NRDL was recently completed in which new entries averaged 63% price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume-based procurement (VBP). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the last five rounds of VBP had, on average, a price reduction of more than 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward.\n9\nTable of Content\ns\nEmerging Markets\nThe Company’s focus on emerging markets, in addition to China, has continued. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in the emerging markets.\nBeyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company’s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of health care partners, such as hospitals, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company’s risk exposure.\nRegulation\nThe pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.\nOf particular importance is the FDA in the U.S., which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the U.S. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the “breakthrough therapy” designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner.\nThe EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU Member States. In particular, EU regulators may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions. Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. The Company’s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company’s business.\nThe Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. (See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of the regulatory approval process.)\nAccess to Medicines\nAs a global health care company, Merck’s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that, in collaboration with key stakeholders, it has a role to play in helping to ensure that its science advances health care, and its products are accessible and affordable globally. The Company is committed to ensuring a high-quality, safe, reliable, supply of its medicines and vaccines, and to implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to sustainable access to its products. \nMerck’s approach is designed to enable it to serve the greatest number of patients today, while meeting the needs of patients in the future. The Company's wide-ranging efforts to expand access to health encompass a set of principles embedded in its business strategies and operations. These principles guide its global approach to addressing significant public health burdens and unmet medical needs. The Company systematically evaluates its pipeline candidates to assess their potential in low and middle-income countries and underserved health care settings. Throughout the life cycle of its products, Merck seeks to evaluate their potential and adapt to changes in the external environment. Collaborating with various stakeholders, including private, governmental, multilateral, and non-profit organizations, the Company seeks to design and deliver sustainable access solutions at the payer, provider, \n10\nTable of Content\ns\nand patient levels. Furthermore, the Company incorporates access to health metrics in its scorecard, making it a component of calculating annual incentive pay for the majority of its global employees. \nIn addition, through social investments, including philanthropic programs and impact investing, Merck is helping to strengthen health systems and build capacity, particularly in communities underserved by health care. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides certain medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the U.S. and U.S. territories who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company’s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicines and vaccines. Globally, Merck has made substantial contributions to access to health through key initiatives, including product donations for humanitarian assistance in low-income countries through the Medical Outreach Program. The Mectizan Donation Program, the longest running disease-specific drug donation program of its kind, supports the elimination of two neglected tropical diseases – onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Additionally, through Merck for Mothers, the Company provides funding, and scientific and business acumen to help global health partners strengthen health systems, expand access to critical maternal health services, and end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck also supports the Merck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization helping to address systemic barriers to access to health care.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nThe Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the Company’s ability to collect, transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company’s business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue. \nThe GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that the Company processes. It also imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (which includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the U.S., except if the data controller meets very specific requirements. Following the \nSchrems II\n decision of the Court of Justice of the EU in 2020, uncertainty has existed as to the permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision, the Company may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries. Since then, the Company entered into the EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with its vendors, suppliers, collaboration partners and clinical trial sites in order to facilitate the lawful transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. In addition, former President Biden issued Executive Order 14086 in October 2022 to address the data privacy concerns raised in the \nSchrems II\n decision through introducing, among other measures, further safeguards and oversight of personal data collection by U.S. signals intelligence activities and providing individuals with a redress mechanism in the U.S. for their data protection concerns. Further certainty for the international transfer of personal data from the EU via the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (successor to the invalidated EU-U.S. Privacy Shield) came about by way of a new EU Adequacy Decision, issued by the EC in July 2023. However, the new Adequacy Decision has already been contested by privacy advocates and is subject to legal review.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both the EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised.\nThere is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against the Company, harm to its reputation, and adversely impact its business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between \n11\nTable of Content\ns\ndifferent regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that the Company faces with regard to data protection regulation.\nIn 2021, China passed the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) that aims to standardize the handling of personal information in China. The PIPL currently applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons in China, the processing of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products and services in China, and to analyze the activities of individuals in China. While similar to the GDPR, the PIPL contains unique requirements not found in the GDPR. The Company has developed and implemented comprehensive plans to ensure compliance with the PIPL, including plans relating to data localization and cross-border transfers.\nAdditional laws and regulations enacted in Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and 19 states in the U.S. have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving requirements and risks and to facilitate the transfer of personal information across international borders.\nDistribution\nThe Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company’s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.\nRaw Materials\nThe Company obtains raw materials essential to its business from numerous suppliers worldwide. Most of the principal materials the Company uses in its manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, the Company obtains certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. The Company attempts, if possible, to mitigate the potential risk associated with raw materials, components and supplies through inventory and appropriate supplier management.\nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses\nPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company’s marketing of its products in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents may not only cover a product \nper se\n, but also pharmaceutical formulations of a product, processes for making a product, including intermediates useful in those processes, and methods of treatment or other uses of a product. Patent protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in individual countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.\nPatent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally provide varying degrees of market exclusivity. Key patents, which generally cover the product \nper se\n, may be subject to a patent term restoration (also known as patent term extension or PTE) of up to five years in the U.S., Japan, and certain other jurisdictions. In Europe, up to five years of extended term may be available in the form of a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). PTEs and SPCs are awarded to offset a portion of the patent term lost during the clinical testing and regulatory review process of a product prior to approval. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity (added to the patent term for all Orange Book-listed patents, and to the regulatory data exclusivity term for small molecule and biologic products) in the U.S. for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product’s SPC term for both small molecule and biologic products. Japan attaches the additional term for pediatric studies to market exclusivity and this extension is unrelated to patent term. In some countries, one or more regulatory exclusivities, including data exclusivity, may provide parallel market protection that is complementary to patent protection and, in some cases, may provide more effective or longer lasting marketing exclusivity than a product’s patent portfolio. In the U.S., the regulatory data/marketing protection term generally runs five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication, and twelve years from first marketing approval of a biological product.\n12\nTable of Content\ns\nThe table below provides a list of expiration dates, which include any pending PTE and SPC periods where indicated, for the key patent protection in the U.S., the EU, Japan and China for the following marketed products:\nProduct\nYear of Expiration (U.S.)\nYear of Expiration (EU)\n(1)\nYear of Expiration (Japan)\n(2)\nYear of Expiration\n \n(China)\nJanuvia\n2026\n(3)\nExpired\n2025-2026\nExpired\nJanumet\n2026\n(3)\nExpired\nN/A\nExpired\nJanumet \nXR\n2026\n(3)\nN/A\nN/A\nExpired\nIsentress\nExpired\n(4)\nExpired\n2026\n(5)\nExpired\nLenvima\n(6)\n2026\n2026\n(7)\n \n2026\nExpired\nBridion\n2026\nExpired\nExpired\nExpired\nBravecto\n2027\n2029\n2029\n2025\nGardasil\n2028\nExpired\nExpired\nExpired\nGardasil \n9\n2028\n2030\n(7)\n2030\n2025\nKeytruda\n2028\n(8)\n2031\n2032-2033\n2028\nLynparza\n(9)\n2027\n(7) \n(with pending PTE)\n2029\n(7)\n2028-2029\nExpired\nWinrevair\n2027\n(10)\n2026\n(10)\nN/A\nN/A\nAdempas\n(11)\nN/A\n(12)\n2028\n(7)\n2027-2028\nExpired\nBelsomra\n2029\nN/A\n2031\nN/A\nPrevymis\n2029\n2029\n(13)\n2029\nExpired\nVaxneuvance\n2031\n(14)\nNo Patent\n(15)\nNo Patent\n(15)\nN/A\nWelireg\n2035 (with pending PTE)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nCapvaxive\n2038\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nNote:    Compound patent unless otherwise noted. Certain of the products listed may be the subject of patent litigation.

For those drug candidates under review or in development, the key U.S. patents may be subject to a future PTE of up to five years and/or six months of pediatric market exclusivity. In addition, depending on the circumstances surrounding any final regulatory approval of the product, there may be other granted patents or pending patent applications that could have relevance to the product as finally approved.\nWhile the expiration of the compound patent generally results in loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, other patents may provide additional market exclusivity associated with certain aspects of the product that extends beyond the compound patent expiration, including those derived from the initial discovery of the product’s active ingredient(s) or from product-related innovation that occurs after this initial discovery. These include later-expiring patents directed to (i) processes and intermediates related to methods of manufacture of the active ingredient(s), (ii) use(s) of the product, and (iii) novel compositions and formulations of the product. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical product sales may also depend upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient(s) of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in other countries. In addition, in the U.S. and certain other countries, a variety of different regulatory exclusivities that impact market exclusivity may be available under relevant law.\nFor further information with respect to the Company’s patents, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 10. “Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities” below.\n14\nTable of Content\ns\nWorldwide, all of the Company’s important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely.\nRoyalty income in 2024 on patent and know-how licenses and other rights amounted to $1.1 billion. Merck also incurred royalty expenses amounting to $1.9 billion in 2024 under patent and know-how licenses it holds.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company’s business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a strong research and development program. At December 31, 2024, approximately 23,500 people were employed in the Company’s research activities. The Company prioritizes its research and development efforts and focuses on candidates that it believes represent breakthrough science for unmet medical needs that will make a difference for patients and payers.\nThe Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. The Company’s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the Company’s research and development resources on candidates the Company believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Merck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality. The Company is committed to ensuring that externally sourced programs remain an important component of its pipeline strategy, with a focus on supplementing its internal research through acquisitions as well as a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies.\nThe Company’s clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, neurosciences, immunology, ophthalmology, respiratory diseases, and vaccines.\nIn the development of human health products, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S. and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the U.S., recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the New Drug Application (NDA) for a drug or the Biologics License Application (BLA) for a vaccine or biologic submitted to the FDA for the required approval.\nOnce the Company’s scientists discover a new small molecule compound or biologic that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition, the Company commences preclinical testing with that compound. Preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity and toxicology. Pending acceptable preclinical data, the Company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements. The clinical testing begins with Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population, define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound’s usefulness. In some situations, the clinical program incorporates adaptive design methodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues, without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a/2b trial design, a two-stage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory, the Company commences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound’s efficacy and safety. Another type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design, a study that includes an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2 study (e.g., multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. An adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design reduces timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate study. Upon completion of Phase 3 trials, if satisfactory, the Company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.\nVaccine development follows the same general pathway as for drugs. Preclinical testing focuses on the vaccine’s safety and ability to elicit a protective immune response (immunogenicity). Pre-marketing vaccine clinical trials are typically done in three phases. Initial Phase 1 clinical studies are conducted in normal subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. Phase 2 studies are dose-ranging studies and provide additional data on safety, immunogenicity and/or effectiveness. Finally, Phase 3 trials are conducted in the \n15\nTable of Content\ns\nintended population for licensure and provide data on immunogenicity and/or effectiveness, as well as safety, to support applications for regulatory approvals. If successful, the Company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies.\nUnited States\nIn the U.S., the FDA review process begins once a complete NDA or BLA is submitted, received and accepted for review by the agency. Within 60 days after receipt, the FDA determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether the application will be granted a priority review or standard review. Pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act VII (PDUFA), the FDA review period target for NDAs or original BLAs is either six months, for priority review, or ten months, for a standard review, from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete. For original efficacy supplements to an NDA or BLA, the FDA review period target is six months, for priority review, or ten months, for a standard review, from the time the supplemental application is received. Once the review timelines are determined, the FDA will generally act upon the application within those timeline goals, unless a major amendment has been submitted (either at the Company’s own initiative or the FDA’s request) to the pending application. If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information, but by no more than three months. Extensions to the review period are communicated to the Company. The FDA can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating that the application will not be approved in its present form and describing all deficiencies that the FDA has identified. Should the Company wish to pursue an application after receiving a CRL, it can resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the FDA in order to support approval. Resubmissions are subject to review period targets, which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission.\nThe FDA has four program designations — Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review — to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product’s development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the NDA/BLA. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The Breakthrough Therapy designation provides manufacturers with all of the features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review. The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product’s clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA’s goal is to take action on the NDA/BLA within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. More than one of these special designations can be granted for a given application (i.e., a product designated as a Breakthrough Therapy may also be eligible for Priority Review).\nDue to the COVID-19 public health crisis, in 2020, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) exercised statutory authority to determine that a public health emergency existed, and declared those circumstances justified the emergency use of drugs and biological products as authorized by the FDA. In 2023, the Secretary issued an amended determination that a public health emergency or a significant potential for a public health emergency existed, and declared that circumstances continued to justify authorization of emergency use of these products. While in effect, this declaration (as amended) enables the FDA to issue Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) permitting distribution and use of specific medical products absent NDA/BLA submission or approval, including products to treat or prevent diseases or conditions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, subject to the terms of any such EUAs. The Company is currently marketing \nLagevrio\n in the U.S. pursuant to an EUA. The FDA must make certain findings to grant an EUA, including that it is reasonable to believe based on the totality of evidence that the drug or biologic may be effective, and that known or potential benefits when used under the terms of the EUA outweigh known or potential risks. Additionally, the FDA must find that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the emergency use of the authorized drug or biologic. The FDA may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.\nEuropean Union\nThe primary method the Company uses to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the “centralized procedure.” This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the \n16\nTable of Content\ns\nEuropean Medicines Agency (EMA). After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA. It is also possible for new chemical products to obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a “mutual recognition procedure” in which an application is made to a single member state and, if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national procedure, the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other EU Member States.\nJapan\nIn Japan, the Company submits new drug applications to the PMDA for its pharmaceutical regulatory review. The PMDA is an independent administrative agency which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). The PMDA considers multiple factors in its review process, including the drug’s safety, efficacy, quality, and manufacturing process in accordance with the Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. In addition, there are various other regulations and guidelines issued by the MHLW or the PMDA that must also be complied with in order to secure approval. The length of the PMDA review process can vary, but it typically takes around one year for a new drug to be approved in Japan. The review period may be shortened if the drug candidate is designated by the MHLW as an innovative drug satisfying certain conditions.\nChina\nIn China, the Company submits marketing applications to the NMPA for an independent review. The NMPA considers multiple factors in its review process, including the drug‘s safety, efficacy, quality, and manufacturing process. Moreover, the NMPA implements strict regulations to ensure that all drugs meet the same standards as those set by the WHO. The agency establishes stringent safety and efficacy requirements for drug approval. The length of the NMPA review process can vary, but it typically takes around one to two years for a new drug to be approved in China.\nOther Markets\nOutside of the U.S., the EU, Japan and China, the Company submits marketing applications to national regulatory authorities. Examples of such are Health Canada, Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanatária in Brazil, Korea Food and Drug Administration in South Korea, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. Each country has a separate and independent review process and timeline. In many markets, approval times can be longer as the regulatory authority requires approval in a major market, such as the U.S. or the EU, and issuance of a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product from that market before initiating their local review process.\nResearch and Development Update\nThe Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the U.S. and internationally or in late-stage clinical development.\nMK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, is a potential first-in-class HER3 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), under review by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The BLA is based on the primary results from the HERTHENA-Lung01 pivotal Phase 2 trial and data results presented at the IASLC 2023 World Conference on Lung Cancer, which were simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. In June 2024, the FDA issued a CRL for the BLA due to findings pertaining to an inspection of a third-party manufacturing facility. The CRL did not identify any issues with the efficacy or safety data submitted. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) was discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and is being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and Merck. Merck is working with Daiichi Sankyo to address FDA feedback.\nMK-6482, \nWelireg,\n is under review in Japan both for the treatment of adults with VHL disease based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial and for the treatment of certain adults with previously treated advanced RCC based on the LITESPARK-005 clinical trial. Additionally, in January 2025, the FDA accepted for priority review a supplemental NDA seeking approval of \nWelireg\n for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older) with advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, based on the LITESPARK-015 trial. The FDA set a PDUFA, or target action, date of May 26, 2025.\nV116, \nCapvaxive\n, a 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine designed to help prevent invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by certain serotypes in adults, is under review in the EU and Japan. The applications are supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating V116 in both vaccine-naïve and vaccine-experienced adult patient populations. In January 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA recommended the approval of \nCapvaxive\n for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by certain types of Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older. The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the EC for marketing authorization in the EU, and a final decision is expected by the second quarter of 2025.\n17\nTable of Content\ns\nMK-7962, \nWinrevair\n, Merck’s novel activin signaling inhibitor, is under review in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with PAH based on the Phase 3 STELLAR trial. In November 2024, Merck announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 ZENITH study, evaluating \nWinrevair\n in adults with PAH with WHO Group 1 FC III or IV at high risk of mortality. Based on the positive results of an interim analysis, an independent data monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. In addition, in January 2025, Merck announced the Phase 3 HYPERION study evaluating \nWinrevair\n in newly diagnosed adults with PAH FC II or III at intermediate or high risk of disease progression was also stopped early based on the positive results from the interim analysis of the ZENITH trial and a review of the totality of data from the \nWinrevair\n clinical program to date. All participants in both the ZENITH and HYPERION studies will be offered the opportunity to receive \nWinrevair\n as part of the open-label, long-term extension study, SOTERIA.\nMK-1654, clesrovimab, is an investigational prophylactic long-acting monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease during their first RSV season. In December 2024, the FDA accepted the BLA for clesrovimab and set a PDUFA date of June 10, 2025. Clesrovimab is also under review in the EU.\nMK-3475, \nKeytruda\n, is an anti-PD-1 therapy approved for the treatment of many cancers that is in clinical development for expanded indications. These studies encompass more than 30 cancer types including: biliary, estrogen receptor positive breast, triple-negative breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, glioblastoma, head and neck, hepatocellular, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-small-cell lung, small-cell lung, melanoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, ovarian, prostate, renal, and urothelial, several of which are currently in Phase 3 clinical development. Further trials are being planned for other cancers.\nKeytruda\n is under review in the EU and Japan for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma, based on the Phase 2/3 IND.227/KEYNOTE-483 trial. In November 2024, the EMA’s CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of \nKeytruda \nin combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable non-epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma. In December 2024, the Company requested a re-examination from the EMA’s CHMP for an extension of the indication to include approval in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma, based on final results from the KEYNOTE-483 trial.\nThe Company is diversifying its oncology portfolio and executing on its strategy which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. Merck has numerous Phase 3 oncology programs within these pillars.\nImmuno-oncology\n•\nMK-1308A is the coformulation of quavonlimab, Merck’s novel investigational anti-CTLA-4 antibody, in combination with pembrolizumab, being evaluated for the treatment of RCC.\n•\nMK-3475, \nKeytruda\n, is being evaluated in the therapeutic areas of hepatocellular, ovarian and small-cell lung cancers.\n•\nMK-3475A is the subcutaneous coformulation of pembrolizumab in combination with hyaluronidase being evaluated for comparability with intravenous pembrolizumab in metastatic NSCLC.\n•\nV940 (mRNA-4157) is an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy being evaluated in combination with \nKeytruda\n as an adjuvant treatment in patients with certain types of melanoma.

Merck is working with Daiichi Sankyo to address FDA feedback.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 75,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 31,000 employed in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and approximately 15,000 third-party contractors globally. Third-party contractors include the Company’s temporary workers, independent contractors, and freelancers who are viewed as full-time equivalent employees; they exclude outsourced service providers. Approximately 73,000 of the Company’s employees are full-time employees. Globally, women comprise 52% of employees, and in the U.S. individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups comprise 37% of its workforce (the Company defines workforce as its employees). Women comprise 46% of the members of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Company’s senior management team is made up of 39% women. Approximately 21% of the Company’s employees are represented by various collective bargaining groups. The Company’s voluntary turnover rate was approximately 4.6% and 5.6%, in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe Company recognizes that its employees are critical to meet the needs of its patients and customers and that its ability to excel depends on the integrity, skill, and collaboration of its employees.\nTalent Acquisition\n \nThe Company uses a comprehensive approach to ensure recruiting, retention and leadership development goals are systematically executed throughout the Company and that it hires talented leaders with a wide \n22\nTable of Content\ns\nrange of knowledge, skills, backgrounds and perspectives.

This includes, but is not limited to, building leadership and management skills, as well as providing technical and functional training to all employees.\n23\nTable of Content\ns\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nThe Company is committed to enabling a safe, sustainable and healthy future and strives to be a strong environmental steward, evolving its efforts in the face of a changing world. The Company’s environmental sustainability strategy has three focus areas:\n•\nDriving operational efficiency;\n•\nDesigning new products to minimize environmental impact; and\n•\nReducing any impacts in the Company’s upstream and downstream value chain.\nThe Company ensures its ongoing commitment to these areas through thoughtful governance. Its Environmental, Health and Safety Council (EHS Council) is a cross-functional body with leadership representation from each area of the Company’s business and is responsible for overseeing its environmental sustainability strategy, policy, and risk mitigation controls. The EHS Council monitors performance against the Company’s goals and increases transparency on environmental issues within the Company, senior management, and the Board of Directors (the Board). The Global Safety and Environment (GSE) vice president communicates progress on environmental sustainability goals, objectives and other important issues to the Board, senior management and the EHS Council. Additionally, the head of the Environmental Sustainability Center of Excellence is a member of the Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy Management Team, a group of functional experts that advises, shapes, and drives the Company’s long-term sustainability strategy with guidance from an internal cross divisional forum of senior leaders. The Company’s cross-functional Environmental Sustainability Implementation Steering Committee was designated by the EHS Council to oversee the progress of initiatives that support the achievement of the Company’s public goals and provide guidance on resourcing of the Company’s environmental sustainability strategy.\nMerck believes that climate change could present risks to its business, as discussed in further detail in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below under the headings “Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects” and “Environmental, social and governance matters may impact the Company’s business and reputation.” Some of the potential impacts of climate change to the Company’s business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to the Company’s facilities, water limitations and disruptions to its supply chain. These potential risks are integrated into the Company’s business planning, including investment in reducing energy usage, water use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nThe Company has adopted a set of climate goals to help position it to succeed in an increasingly resource-constrained world. These goals address the rising expectations of the Company’s customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees regarding the environmental impact of its operations and supply chain. The Company’s climate goals include reducing Scope 1 and 2 operational GHG emissions 46% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline), sourcing 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025, and reducing Scope 3 GHG emissions 30% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline). In 2024, the Company committed to a net-zero target for its GHG emissions across its global operations (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2045, aligned with the guidelines of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Other environmental sustainability initiatives of the Company include:\n•\nPartnering for progress across the Company’s value chain.\n The Company is working to reduce its Scope 3 emissions through a robust supplier engagement approach to drive collaboration upstream and downstream in its value chain. By engaging with its suppliers, the Company can identify key ways to reduce its GHG emissions and pinpoint additional tangible benefits for the business.\n•\nPlaybooks for a sustainable environment.\n To help direct and track projects in support of its goals, the Company has developed a series of guidance documents for its global sites. In 2021, the Company launched its Low Carbon Transition Playbook (LCTP), a common platform that includes a gap assessment to help the Company’s global sites evaluate the maturity of their energy programs and help create short- and long-term plans to reduce sites’ carbon intensity and build toward a low-carbon future. Based on learnings from use, the Company issued LCTP 2.0 in 2022 with a capability to facilitate knowledge sharing across sites. In 2022, the Company also created the Waste Diversion Playbook, which takes a similar approach to guide sites on developing a roadmap to their and the Company’s shared 2025 goals on waste diversion, including local waste-diversion strategies and environmentally responsible procurement practices. In 2024, the Company expanded this list with the addition of a Water Conservation Playbook. This approach guides projects consistently across the Company’s global network of sites and enables continuous improvement toward meetings its goals.\n24\nTable of Content\ns\n•\nRealizing the benefits of green and sustainable science\n. The Company believes that meeting its environmental sustainability goals is intrinsically linked to the creation of innovative, cost-efficient manufacturing processes with low environmental impact. The Company aims to develop efficient and sustainable processes at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use and waste from its commercial manufacturing. The Company utilizes an innovative “green-by-design” development strategy with a goal to progress from an initial early clinical supply route to a fully optimized and sustainable commercial manufacturing process. In 2024, for the fifth year in a row, the Company received the Peter J. Dunn Award for Green Chemistry and Engineering Impact, an award given by the American Chemical Society in recognition of outstanding implementation of novel green chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry.\n•\nWaste diversion\n. The Company continuously evaluates its sites’ waste disposal methods to gain a better understanding of its network and changes therein, as well as to identify risks and opportunities in its value chain. Based on its evaluation, the Company implemented programs to divert non-hazardous landfill waste from its two highest landfill-generating sites. The Company remains committed to its 2025 public waste diversion goals of no more than 20% of the Company’s global operational waste sent to landfills or incinerators (without energy recovery) and that 50% of its sites will send zero waste to landfills by 2025.\n•\nWater as a shared resource. \nAs water is a key input to the Company’s manufacturing operations, the Company assesses water risk throughout its network as a standard business practice. Both of the Company’s priority water-stress risk sites have conservation plans in place, and site staff are actively working on water use reduction and recycling improvement projects. These projects are consistent with the Company’s ongoing commitment to achieving its stated goal of maintaining global water use at or below 2015 levels by 2025. The Company’s sites are employing various technologies and techniques aimed at reducing its water footprint and improving operational performance. The Company’s endorsement of the United Nations CEO Water Mandate enables alignment of the Company’s water program with the mandate’s principles. The Company has continued to identify partnerships to help it advance its water stewardship priorities in the areas in which it operates.\nThe Company continues to review and explore other opportunities to further its environmental strategy and will evaluate potential impacts and commitments.\nManagement does not believe that expenditures related to these initiatives should have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.\nEnvironmental Regulation and Remediation\nThe Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $4 million in 2024 and are estimated to be $26 million in the aggregate for the years 2025 through 2029. These amounts do not consider potential recoveries from other parties. The Company has taken an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs and, in management’s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $41 million and $42 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $46 million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year.\nGeographic Area Information\nThe Company’s operations outside the U.S. are conducted primarily through subsidiaries. Sales worldwide by subsidiaries outside the U.S. as a percentage of total Company sales was 50% in 2024, 53% in 2023 and 54% in 2022.\nThe Company’s worldwide business is subject to risks of currency fluctuations, governmental actions and other governmental proceedings abroad. The Company does not regard these risks as a deterrent to further expansion of its operations abroad. However, the Company closely reviews its methods of operations and adopts strategies responsive to changing economic and political conditions.\n25\nTable of Content\ns\nMerck has operations in countries located in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific.

The Company maintained its focus on the pursuit of breakthrough science and innovation, making disciplined investments in compelling science to drive long-term value for patients, customers, and shareholders. Merck advanced its robust early- and late-phase pipeline which includes growing diversity across new therapeutic areas and modalities and completed several promising business development transactions. The Company continued to return capital to shareholders, primarily through dividends.\n46\nTable of Content\ns\nWorldwide sales were $64.2 billion in 2024, an increase of 7% compared with 2023, or 10% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to growth in oncology, cardiovascular and animal health, partially offset by declines in diabetes, virology (driven largely by lower sales of COVID-19 medication \nLagevrio\n), immunology (as Merck’s marketing rights to these products ended in 2024) and vaccines. \nMerck continues to execute value creating business development opportunities focused on innovation to augment its robust internal pipeline with compelling external science. Highlights of 2024 activity include the following: \n•\nClosed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-2010 (LM-299), a novel investigational programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) bispecific antibody from LaNova Medicines Ltd (LaNova).\n•\nClosed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-4082 (HS-10535), an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist from Hansoh Pharma (Hansoh).\n•\nAcquired global rights to MK-1045 (formerly CN201), a novel investigational clinical-stage bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases from Curon Pharmaceutical (Curon).\n•\nAcquired Eyebiotech Limited (EyeBio), a privately held ophthalmology-focused biotechnology company developing candidates for the prevention and treatment of vision loss.\n•\nAcquired Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases.\nDuring 2024, Merck continued its efforts to address unmet medical needs by launching new products with significant patient benefit, including the U.S. launches of \nWinrevair\n, for the treatment of certain adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and \nCapvaxive,\n for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. \nWinrevair\n was also approved in the EU. \nThe Company received more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets in 2024, including the \nWinrevair\n and \nCapvaxive\n approvals noted above, along with numerous approvals in oncology. \nKeytruda\n received approval for additional indications in the U.S. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma and urothelial carcinoma, in combination with chemotherapy in the therapeutic areas of biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial carcinoma, gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in combination with Padcev (enfortunab vedotin-ejfv) for advanced urothelial carcinoma. Also in 2024, \nWelireg\n was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery. Lynparza, which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca), received approval in China for the treatment of certain adult patients with germline \nBRCA\n-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high-risk early breast cancer.\nIn addition to the regulatory approvals discussed above, the Company advanced its late-stage pipeline with several regulatory submissions. \n•\nMK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, is a potential first-in-class HER3 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. In June 2024, the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the Biologics License Application (BLA) due to findings pertaining to an inspection of a third-party manufacturing facility. The CRL did not identify any issues with the efficacy or safety data submitted. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) was discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and is \n47\nTable of Content\ns\nbeing jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and Merck. Merck is working with Daiichi Sankyo to address FDA feedback. \n•\nMK-6482\n, Welireg,\n is under review in Japan both for the treatment of adults with VHL disease and for the treatment of certain adults with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). \nWelireg\n is also under priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of certain patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.\n•\nV116, \nCapvaxive\n, a 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine designed to help prevent invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by certain serotypes in adults, is under review in the EU and Japan. \n•\nMK-7962, \nWinrevair\n, Merck’s novel activin signaling inhibitor, is under review in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with PAH.\n•\nMK-1654, clesrovimab, is an investigational prophylactic long-acting monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease during their first RSV season under review by the FDA. Clesrovimab is also under review in the EU.\n•\nAdditionally, \nKeytruda\n is under review in the EU and Japan for a supplemental indication for the treatment of certain patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. \nDuring 2024, the Company initiated more than 20 Phase 3 studies spanning cardiometabolic, immunology, infectious diseases, oncology, ophthalmology and vaccines.\nThe Company is diversifying its oncology portfolio and executing on its strategy which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. Merck’s Phase 3 oncology programs within these pillars are as follows:\nImmuno-oncology\n•\nMK-1308A, the coformulation of quavonlimab, Merck’s novel investigational anti-CTLA-4 antibody, in combination with pembrolizumab for RCC; \n•\nMK-3475, \nKeytruda\n, in the therapeutic areas of hepatocellular, ovarian and small-cell lung cancers; \n•\nMK-3475A, the subcutaneous coformulation of pembrolizumab in combination with hyaluronidase, being evaluated for comparability with intravenous pembrolizumab in metastatic NSCLC; and\n•\nV940 (mRNA-4157), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy, in combination with \nKeytruda\n, as an adjuvant treatment in patients with certain types of melanoma and NSCLC, being developed as part of a collaboration with Moderna, Inc.\nPrecision molecular targeting\n•\nMK-1026, nemtabrutinib, an oral, reversible, non-covalent Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, for hematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma; \n•\nMK-1084, an investigational oral selective \nKRAS\n G12C inhibitor, in combination with \nKeytruda\n, for metastatic NSCLC;\n•\nMK-3543, bomedemstat, an investigational orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor for myeloproliferative disorders; \n•\nMK-5684, opevesostat, an investigational cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) inhibitor for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; \n•\nMK-7339, Lynparza, in combination with \nKeytruda\n, for non-small-cell lung and small-cell lung cancers; and\n•\nMK-7902, Lenvima, being developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai), in combination with \nKeytruda\n, for esophageal cancer. \nTissue targeting\n•\nMK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, being developed in collaboration wtih Daiichi Sankyo, for NSCLC as noted above;\n•\nMK-2140, zilovertamab vedotin, an ADC targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) for hematological malignancies, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma;\n•\nMK-2400, ifinatamab deruxtecan, an ADC being evaluated in patients with relapsed SCLC versus chemotherapy, being developed as part of a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo; and\n48\nTable of Content\ns\n•\nMK-2870, sacituzumab tirumotecan, an investigational trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed ADC, being developed as part of a collaboration with Kelun-Biotech for breast, cervical, endometrial, gastric and non-small-cell lung cancers.\nAdditionally, the Company currently has candidates in Phase 3 clinical development in several other therapeutic areas:\n•\nMK-3000, an investigational, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific antibody that acts as an agonist of the Wingless-related integration site signaling pathway, for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration;\n•\nMK-8591A, a once-daily oral combination of doravirine and islatravir, an investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection (which is on partial clinical hold for higher doses of islatravir than those used in current clinical trials); \n•\nMK-8591D, islatravir in combination with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV-1 infection (which is on partial clinical hold for higher doses of islatravir than those used in current clinical trials), being developed in collaboration with Gilead Sciences Inc.;\n•\nMK-0616, enlicitide decanoate, an investigational, oral proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia, including in studies evaluating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and a cardiovascular outcomes study;\n•\nMK-7240, tulisokibart, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1A, a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis; and \n•\nMK-4482, \nLagevrio\n, which is reflected in Phase 3 development in the U.S. as it remains investigational following Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in 2021. \nMerck’s capital allocation strategy continues to prioritize investments in its business to drive near- and long-term growth, including investing in the Company’s key growth drivers and expansive pipeline of novel candidates, each of which has potential to address important unmet medical needs. Research and development expenses in 2024 reflect increased development spending particularly in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology and cardiometabolic. In addition, Merck remains committed to its dividend and will continue to pursue the most compelling external science and technologies through value-enhancing business development transactions.  \nIn November 2024, Merck’s Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.81 per share from $0.77 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock. During 2024, the Company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends of $7.8 billion and share repurchases of $1.3 billion. In January 2025, Merck’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional $10 billion of Merck’s common stock for its treasury.\n49\nTable of Content\ns\nGAAP and non-GAAP EPS were negatively affected in 2024, 2023 and 2022 by $1.28, $6.21, and $0.22, respectively, of charges for certain upfront and pre-approval milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements, as well as charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions. \nPricing\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that eliminated the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. \nAs a result of this provision, the Company paid state Medicaid programs more in rebates than it received on Medicaid sales of \nJanuvia\n, \nJanumet\n and \nJanumet\n XR in 2024. \nIn 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which made significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits (which has taken effect in 2025), and government price setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs (starting in 2026) and Medicare Part B drugs (starting in 2028). Government price setting may also impact pricing in the private market negatively affecting the Company’s performance. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), selected \nJanuvia\n for the first year of the IRA’s “Drug Price Negotiation Program” (Program). Pursuant to the IRA’s Program, a government price was set for \nJanuvia\n, which will become effective on January 1, 2026. \nIn January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that \nJanumet\n and \nJanumet\n XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA’s Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. \nThe Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA’s Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). Additionally, increased utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program and restrictions on the Company’s ability to identify inappropriate discounts are having a negative impact on Company performance. Furthermore, the Executive Branch and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company’s sales performance in 2024 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.\nOperating Results\nSales\n($ in millions)\n2024\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2023\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2022\nUnited States\n$\n32,277\n \n13\n \n%\n13\n \n%\n$\n28,480 \n5 \n%\n5 \n%\n$\n27,206 \nInternational\n31,891\n \n1\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n31,635 \n(1)\n%\n4 \n%\n32,077 \nTotal\n$\n64,168\n \n7\n \n%\n10\n \n%\n$\n60,115 \n1 \n%\n4 \n%\n$\n59,283 \nWorldwide sales were $64.2 billion in 2024, representing growth of 7% compared with 2023, or 10% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The devaluation of the Argentine peso contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Global sales growth was primarily due to higher sales in the oncology franchise, largely due to strong growth of \nKeytruda\n and \nWelireg\n, as well as increased alliance revenue from Reblozyl and Lynparza. Also contributing to revenue growth were higher sales in the cardiovascular \n50\nTable of Content\ns\nfranchise, largely attributable to the launch of \nWinrevair\n, higher sales of certain hospital acute care products, particularly \nPrevymis\n, as well as higher sales of animal health products. Sales growth in 2024 was partially offset by lower sales in the diabetes franchise, due to \nJanuvia \nand \nJanumet\n, and lower sales in the virology franchise largely attributable to \nLagevrio\n. Lower sales in the immunology franchise due to the return of the marketing rights for \nRemicade\n and \nSimponi\n in former Merck territories to Johnson & Johnson on October 1, 2024,\n \nand lower sales in the vaccines franchise primarily due to \nGardasil/Gardasil 9 \nalso offset sales growth in 2024.\nSales in the U.S. grew 13% to $32.3 billion in 2024 primarily driven by higher sales of \nKeytruda\n, \nWinrevair\n,\n Gardasil\n 9, \nWelireg\n,\n Bridion\n, \nLagevrio\n, and \nPrevymis\n, as well as higher alliance revenue from Reblozyl, partially offset by lower sales of \nJanuvia\n and \nVaxneuvance\n. \nInternational sales grew 1% in 2024, or 6% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The devaluation of the Argentine peso contributed approximately 3 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market.

The \nKeytruda\n clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.\nGlobal sales of \nKeytruda\n grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. \nKeytruda\n sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of bladder, endometrial, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and renal cell cancers, as well as increased uptake across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC and RCC, and higher pricing. \nKeytruda\n sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for \nKeytruda \nin the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.\nSummarized below are the \nKeytruda\n regulatory approvals received in 2024 and, to date, in 2025.\nDate\nApproval\nJanuary 2024\nFDA approval in combination with chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of patients with FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) 2014 Stage III-IVA cervical cancer, based on the KEYNOTE-A18 trial.\n51\nTable of Content\ns\nJanuary 2024\nFDA full approval for the treatment of patients with HCC secondary to hepatitis B who have received prior systemic therapy other than a PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) containing regimen.

Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck paid a royalty of 6.5% on worldwide sales of \nKeytruda\n through December 2023 to one third party; this royalty declined to 2.5% in 2024 and will continue through 2026 terminating thereafter. The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of \nKeytruda\n to another third party, the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty expired in the U.S. in September 2024 and will expire on varying dates in major European markets in the second half of 2025. The royalty expenses are included in \nCost of sales\n.\nLynparza is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lynparza is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. Alliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 9% in 2024 largely due to higher demand in most international markets. In January 2025, China’s NMPA approved Lynparza as adjuvant treatment for adult patients with germline \nBRCA\n-mutated, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer, based on the OlympiA trial.\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, RCC, HCC, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with advanced RCC, and in combination with \nKeytruda\n for certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. Alliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 5% in 2024 primarily reflecting higher demand and pricing in the U.S.\nSales of \nWelireg\n, for the treatment of adult patients with certain VHL disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, more than doubled in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the FDA in December 2023. In November 2024, \nWelireg\n was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain VHL disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved \nWelireg\n as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with VHL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two VEGF targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of \nWelireg\n will be valid for one year, subject to yearly renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of \nWelireg\n in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.\nReblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl is approved for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. Alliance revenue related to this collaboration (consisting of royalties) increased 75% in 2024 due to strong underlying sales performance. \nVaccines\n($ in millions)\n2024\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2023\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2022\nGardasil/Gardasil \n9\n$\n8,583\n \n(3)\n%\n(2)\n%\n$\n8,886 \n29 \n%\n33 \n%\n$\n6,897 \nProQuad\n920\n \n6\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n870 \n4 \n%\n4 \n%\n839 \nM-M-R \nII\n464\n \n8\n \n%\n9\n \n%\n430 \n5 \n%\n4 \n%\n411 \nVarivax\n1,102\n \n3\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n1,068 \n8 \n%\n8 \n%\n991 \nVaxneuvance\n808\n \n22\n \n%\n23\n \n%\n665 \n*\n*\n170 \nPneumovax \n23\n263\n \n(36)\n%\n(34)\n%\n412 \n(32)\n%\n(31)\n%\n602 \n* > 100%\n53\nTable of Content\ns\nCombined worldwide sales of \nGardasil\n and \nGardasil \n9, vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), declined 3% in 2024 primarily driven by lower demand in China. Outside of China, \nGardasil/Gardasil\n 9 achieved strong growth in most other international markets due to higher demand, particularly in Japan due to a national catch-up immunization program, and in the U.S. due to public sector buying patterns, higher pricing and demand. Beginning in mid-2024, the Company observed a significant decline in shipments from its distributor and commercialization partner in China, Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co., Ltd. (Zhifei), to disease and control prevention institutions and correspondingly into the points of vaccination, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei. Accordingly, the Company shipped less than its contracted doses to Zhifei in the latter part of 2024. Lower demand in China persisted and, at the end of 2024, overall channel inventory levels in China remained elevated at above normal levels. Therefore, the Company made a decision to temporarily pause shipments to China beginning in February 2025 through at least the middle of the year and, as a result, \nGardasil/Gardasil\n 9 sales will decline significantly in 2025 compared with 2024. In January 2025, China’s NMPA approved \nGardasil\n for use in males 9-26 years of age to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers and diseases. \nThe Company is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of \nGardasil/Gardasil \n9. Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a 7% royalty on sales of \nGardasil/Gardasil\n 9 in the U.S. to one third party (this royalty expires in December 2028). Merck paid an additional 7% royalty on worldwide sales of \nGardasil/Gardasil\n 9 to another third party; this royalty expired in December 2023. The royalty expenses are included in \nCost of sales\n.\nGlobal sales of \nProQuad\n, a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, grew 6% in 2024 primarily due to higher pricing in the U.S. Worldwide sales of \nM-M-R\n II, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, grew 8% in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in certain international markets, partially offset by lower demand in the U.S. Global sales of \nVarivax,\n a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), grew 3% in 2024 primarily attributable to higher pricing in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales in Latin America due to supply constraints. The Company is experiencing manufacturing delays related to \nProQuad\n and \nVarivax\n. As a result, the Company anticipates that some international markets will experience supply constraints during 2025. In order to ensure consistent supply in the U.S., in January 2025, the Company borrowed doses of \nProQuad\n from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile. The borrowing will reduce sales of \nProQuad\n in the first quarter of 2025 by approximately $70 million. These doses will be used to support routine vaccination in the U.S.\nWorldwide sales of \nVaxneuvance\n, a vaccine to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by certain serotypes, rose 22% in 2024 primarily due to continued uptake following launches in the pediatric indication in Europe, Japan, and other countries in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by lower demand in the U.S. due to competition. Merck is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of \nVaxneuvance\n. Under the most significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of \nVaxneuvance\n through 2026; this royalty will decline to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035. The royalty expenses are included in \nCost of sales\n. \nWorldwide sales of \nPneumovax\n 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, declined 36% in 2024 due to lower global demand, particularly in the U.S. as the market has shifted toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.\nIn June 2024, the FDA approved \nCapvaxive\n (Pneumococcal 21-valent Conjugate Vaccine) for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by certain serotypes in individuals 18 years of age and older. The approval was supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating \nCapvaxive\n in both vaccine-naïve and vaccine-experienced adult patient populations, including STRIDE-3, STRIDE-4, STRIDE-5 and STRIDE-6. Sales of \nCapvaxive\n were $97 million in 2024. Merck is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of \nCapvaxive\n. Under the most significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of \nCapvaxive\n through 2026; this royalty will decline to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035.

The \nBridion\n sales decline was partially offset by higher demand and pricing in the U.S. The patents that provided market exclusivity for \nBridion \nin the EU and Japan expired in July 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines of \nBridion\n in these markets and expects the declines to continue. \nWorldwide sales of \nPrevymis\n, a medicine for prophylaxis (prevention) of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in certain high risk adult and pediatric recipients of an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and for prophylaxis of CMV disease in certain high risk adult and pediatric recipients of a kidney transplant, grew 30% in 2024 largely due to higher global demand, particularly in the U.S.\nCardiovascular\n($ in millions)\n2024\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2023\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2022\nWinrevair\n$\n419\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n$\n— \n— \n%\n— \n%\n$\n— \nAlliance Revenue - Adempas/Verquvo \n(1)\n415\n \n13\n \n%\n13\n \n%\n367 \n8 \n%\n8 \n%\n341 \nAdempas\n287\n \n12\n \n%\n14\n \n%\n255 \n7 \n%\n8 \n%\n238 \n(1)\n Alliance revenue for Adempas and Verquvo represents Merck’s share of profits from sales in Bayer’s marketing territories, which are product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn March 2024, the FDA approved \nWinrevair\n for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1) to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class (FC), and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. In August 2024, the EC approved \nWinrevair\n, in combination with other PAH therapies, for the treatment of PAH in adult patients with WHO FC II to III, to improve exercise capacity. The FDA and EC approvals were based on the STELLAR trial. \nWinrevair\n has since launched in Germany. Timing for commercial availability of \nWinrevair\n in the remaining EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures, which is expected to occur in most other major EU markets in the second half of 2025. \nWinrevair\n is the subject of a licensing agreement pursuant to which Merck pays a 22% royalty on sales of \nWinrevair\n to BMS. The royalty expenses are included in \nCost of sales\n.\nAdempas and Verquvo are part of a worldwide collaboration with Bayer AG (Bayer) to market and develop soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulators (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Adempas is approved for the treatment of certain types of PAH and chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH). Verquvo is approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Alliance revenue from the collaboration grew 13% in 2024 reflecting higher demand in Bayer’s marketing territories. Revenue also includes sales of Adempas and Verquvo in Merck’s marketing territories. Sales of Adempas in Merck’s marketing territories grew 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher demand.\nVirology\n \n($ in millions)\n2024\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2023\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2022\nLagevrio\n964\n \n(33)\n%\n(28)\n%\n1,428 \n(75)\n%\n(74)\n%\n5,684 \nLagevrio\n is an investigational oral antiviral COVID-19 medicine being developed in a collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).

As a result of this provision, the Company paid state Medicaid programs more in rebates than it received on Medicaid sales of \nJanuvia\n, \nJanumet\n and \nJanumet\n XR in 2024. \nIn early 2025, Merck lowered the list price of the \nJanuvia\n family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount Merck pays to Medicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.\nWhile the key U.S. patent for \nJanuvia\n, \nJanumet\n and\n Janumet\n XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that \nJanuvia\n and \nJanumet\n will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026 and \nJanumet\n XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company’s sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA. Additionally, i\nn \n2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that \nJanuvia\n would be included in the first year of the IRA’s Program. Pursuant to the IRA’s Program, a government price was set for \nJanuvia\n, which will become effective on January 1, 20\n26. Also, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that \nJanumet\n and \nJanumet\n XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA’s Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company ha\ns sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA’s Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). As a result of \nthe anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing \ncompetitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for \nJanuvia,\n \nJanumet\n and \nJanumet\n XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter. \nThe Company lost market exclusivity for \nJanuvia\n in all of the EU and for \nJanumet\n in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for \nJanumet\n was lost in other European countries in April 2023. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue. Generic equivalents of \nJanuvi\na and \nJanumet\n have also launched in China.\n56\nTable of Content\ns\nAnimal Health Segment\n($ in millions)\n2024\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2023\n% Change\n% Change \nExcluding Foreign\nExchange\n2022\nLivestock\n$\n3,462\n \n4\n \n%\n9\n \n%\n$\n3,337 \n1 \n%\n4 \n%\n$\n3,300 \nCompanion Animal\n2,415\n \n6\n \n%\n7\n \n%\n2,288 \n2 \n%\n3 \n%\n2,250 \n$\n5,877\n \n4\n \n%\n8\n \n%\n$\n5,625 \n1 \n%\n3 \n%\n$\n5,550 \nAnimal Health sales grew 4% in 2024, or 8% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The devaluation of the Argentine peso contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. \nSales of livestock products grew 4% in 2024 primarily due to higher pricing, increased demand for poultry and swine products, as well as the inclusion of sales from the July 2024 acquisition of the aqua business of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco aqua business). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition of the Elanco aqua business.\nSales of companion animal products grew 6% in 2024 reflecting higher pricing.

Cost of sales includes the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements, which totaled $2.4 billion in 2024 and $2.0 billion in 2023. Amortization expense in 2024 and 2023 includes $48 million and $154 million, respectively, of cumulative catch-up amortization related to Merck’s collaborations with AstraZeneca and Eisai, respectively. (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on Merck’s collaborative arrangements). Also included in cost of sales are expenses associated with restructuring activities, which amounted to $495 million in 2024 and $211 million in 2023, primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. Separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in \nRestructuring costs\n as discussed below.\nGross margin was 76.3% in 2024 compared with 73.2% in 2023. The gross margin improvement was primarily due to the favorable effects of product mix (including lower royalty rates related to \nKeytruda\n and \nGardasil/Gardasil \n9\n \nsales) and foreign exchange, partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets, higher restructuring costs (primarily reflecting asset impairment charges), and increased manufacturing-related costs (including inventory write-offs). \nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $10.8 billion in 2024, an increase of 3% compared with 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs (including compensation and benefits), and increased promotional costs (reflecting prioritization in support of key growth drivers including new product launches), as well as higher selling and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower restructuring costs. \n57\nTable of Content\ns\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $17.9 billion in 2024, a decline of 41% compared with 2023. The decline was primarily due to lower charges for business development activity and the favorable effect of foreign exchange.\nSignificant business development transactions in 2024 include charges of:\n•\n$1.35 billion for the acquisition of EyeBio and $100 million for a related developmental milestone\n•\n$750 million for the acquisition of MK-1045 (formerly CN201) from Curon \n•\n$656 million for the acquisition of Harpoon\n•\n$588 million for a global license agreement with LaNova\n•\n$112 million for a global license agreement with Hansoh\nSignificant business development transactions in 2023 include charges of: \n•\n$10.2 billion for the acquisition of Prometheus \n•\n$5.5 billion related to the formation of a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo\n•\n$1.2 billion for the acquisition of Imago\n•\n$175 million for a license and collaboration agreement with Kelun-Biotech \nThe decline in R&D expenses was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs (reflecting in part increased headcount) and increased clinical development spending, including for recently acquired programs. \nR&D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (MRL), the Company’s research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $10.1 billion in 2024 and $9.0 billion in 2023. Also included in R&D expenses are Animal Health research costs, upfront payments for collaboration and licensing agreements (including charges for the transactions with LaNova, Hansoh, Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun-Biotech noted above), charges for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions (including charges for the acquisitions of EyeBio, MK-1045, Harpoon, Prometheus and Imago noted above) and costs incurred by other divisions in support of R&D activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $7.7 billion in 2024 and $20.7 billion in 2023. R&D expenses also include an impairment charge of $779 million in 2023 (related to gefapixant). See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this impairment charge. The Company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material. \nRestructuring Costs\nIn January 2024, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the Company’s Human Health global manufacturing network as the future pipeline shifts to new modalities and also optimize the Animal Health global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency. The actions contemplated under the 2024 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2031, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion. Approximately 60% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The remainder of the costs will result in cash outlays, relating primarily to facility shut-down costs. The Company expects to record charges of approximately $550 million in 2025 related to the 2024 Restructuring Program. The Company anticipates the actions under the 2024 Restructuring Program will result in cumulative annual net cost savings of approximately $750 million by the end of 2031. \nIn 2019, Merck approved a global restructuring program (2019 Restructuring Program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing the Company’s manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. The actions under the 2019 Restructuring Program were substantially complete at the end of 2023 and, as of January 1, 2024, any remaining activities are being accounted for as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program. \nRestructuring costs\n of $309 million in 2024 and $599 million in 2023 include separation and other costs associated with these restructuring activities. Separation costs incurred were associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for involuntary headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Other expenses in \nRestructuring costs\n include facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination \n58\nTable of Content\ns\ncharges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation plan costs. For segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses. \nAdditional costs associated with the Company’s restructuring activities are included in \nCost of sales\n, \nSelling, general and administrative\n expenses and \nResearch and development \ncosts. The Company recorded aggregate pretax costs related to restructuring program activities of $888 million in 2024 and $933 million in 2023 (of which $190 million related to the 2024 Restructuring Program). See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. \nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net, was $24 million of income in 2024 compared with $466 million of expense in 2023 primarily reflecting a $572.5 million charge in 2023 related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation. The favorability was also due to $170 million of income in 2024 related to the expansion of an existing development and commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, as well as lower foreign exchange losses in 2024. Other (income) expense, net, was unfavorably affected in 2024 by lower income from investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense compared with 2023.\nFor details on the components of Other (income) expense, net, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSegment Profits\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPharmaceutical segment profits\n$\n44,533\n \n$\n38,880 \n$\n36,852 \nAnimal Health segment profits\n1,938\n \n1,737 \n1,963 \nNon-segment activity\n(26,535)\n(38,728)\n(22,371)\nIncome Before Taxes\n$\n19,936\n \n$\n1,889 \n$\n16,444 \nPharmaceutical segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, as well as SG&A expenses directly incurred by the segment. Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&A and R&D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, Merck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&D expenses incurred by MRL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. Also excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in “Non-segment activity” in the above table. Also included in “Non-segment activity” are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements. \nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. Animal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturing-related costs, partially offset by increased administrative costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. \nTaxes on Income\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and MK-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\nWhile many jurisdictions in which Merck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company’s 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting \n59\nTable of Content\ns\nfor the tax effects of intercompany transactions. The Company expects the impact of the global minimum tax will increase its effective income tax rate by approximately 2% in 2025. In addition, beginning in 2026, the tax rates on foreign earnings and export income are scheduled to increase under existing provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) and may result in an increase to the Company’s effective income tax rate. Also, in the event that the provision of the TCJA requiring capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses for tax purposes is repealed along the lines proposed in the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024, the Company will again be able to realize the benefit of U.S. R&D expenses as incurred, but expects no material impact to its effective income tax rate.\nThe effective income tax rate of 80.0% in 2023 includes a 65.6 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisitions of Prometheus and Imago (for which no tax benefits were recognized) and the Daiichi Sankyo collaboration. These charges reduced domestic pretax income by approximately $16.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the effective income tax rate in 2023 reflects higher foreign taxes and the impact of the R&D capitalization provision of the TCJA on the Company’s U.S. global intangible low-taxed income inclusion, partially offset by a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as higher foreign tax credits. \nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently conducting examinations of the Company’s tax returns for the years 2017 and 2018, including the one-time transition tax enacted under the TCJA. If the IRS disagrees with the Company’s transition tax position, it may result in a significant tax liability. The IRS is also currently conducting examinations of the Company’s tax returns for the years 2021 and 2022. In addition, various state and foreign tax examinations are in progress.\nNon-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company’s performance that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors’ understanding of the Company’s results since management uses non-GAAP measures to assess performance. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. The excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities, and certain other items. These excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. \nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes a non-GAAP EPS metric. Management uses non-GAAP measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the Company along with other metrics. In addition, annual employee compensation, including senior management’s compensation, is derived in part using a non-GAAP pretax income metric. Since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. The information on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n60\nTable of Content\ns\nA reconciliation between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is as follows:\n($ in millions except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome before taxes as reported under GAAP\n$\n19,936\n \n$\n1,889 \n$\n16,444 \nIncrease (decrease) for excluded items:\nAcquisition- and divestiture-related costs \n(1)\n2,519\n \n2,876 \n3,704 \nRestructuring costs\n888\n \n933 \n666 \nLoss (income) from investments in equity securities, net\n45\n \n(279)\n1,348 \nOther items:\nCharge for Zetia antitrust litigation settlements\n—\n \n573 \n— \nNon-GAAP income before taxes\n23,388\n \n5,992 \n22,162 \nTaxes on income as reported under GAAP\n2,803\n \n1,512 \n1,918 \nEstimated tax benefit on excluded items \n(2)\n606\n \n631 \n1,232 \nTax benefit resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years\n519\n \n— \n— \nNon-GAAP taxes on income\n3,928\n \n2,143 \n3,150 \nNon-GAAP net income\n19,460\n \n3,849 \n19,012 \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as reported under GAAP\n16\n \n12 \n7 \nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Merck & Co., Inc.\n$\n19,444\n \n$\n3,837 \n$\n19,005 \nEPS assuming dilution as reported under GAAP \n(3)\n$\n6.74\n \n$\n0.14 \n$\n5.71 \nEPS difference\n0.91\n \n1.37 \n1.77 \nNon-GAAP EPS assuming dilution\n (3)\n$\n7.65\n \n$\n1.51 \n$\n7.48 \n(1)\nAmounts in 2024, 2023 and 2022 include $39 million, $792 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, of intangible asset impairment charges. \n(2)\n The estimated tax impact on the excluded items is determined by applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the non-GAAP adjustments.\n(3)    \nGAAP and non-GAAP EPS were negatively affected in 2024, 2023 and 2022 by $1.28, $6.21, and $0.22, respectively, of charges for certain upfront and pre-approval milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements, as well as charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nAcquisition- and Divestiture-Related Costs\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions and divestitures of businesses. These amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also excluded are integration, transaction, and certain other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS also exclude amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations and licensing arrangements.\nRestructuring Costs\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude costs related to restructuring actions (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). These amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. Accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. Restructuring costs also include other exits costs, such as asset impairment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs. \nIncome and Losses from Investments in Equity Securities\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities either owned directly or through ownership interests in investment funds.\nCertain Other Items\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain other items. These items are adjusted for after evaluating them on an individual basis, considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects. Typically, these items \n61\nTable of Content\ns\nare unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS in 2024 is a benefit due to reductions in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS in 2023 is a charge related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). \nResearch and Development\nResearch Pipeline\nThe Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the U.S. and internationally, as well as in late-stage clinical development. A chart reflecting the Company’s current research pipeline as of February 21, 2025 and related discussion is set forth in Item 1. “Business\n —\n Research and Development” above.\nAcquisitions, Research Collaborations and Licensing Agreements\nMerck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. Certain recent transactions are summarized below; additional details are included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Merck actively monitors the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the Company’s strategic criteria.\nIn December 2024, Merck closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-2010 (LM-299), a novel investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody from LaNova. Merck recorded a charge of $588 million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses in 2024, or $0.18 per share, for the upfront payment, which was made in January 2025. LaNova is also eligible to receive milestone payments associated with the technology transfer, development, regulatory approval and commercialization of MK-2010 (LM-299) across multiple indications.\nAlso in December 2024, Merck closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-4082 (HS-10535), an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist from Hansoh. Merck recorded a charge of $112 million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses in 2024, or $0.04 per share, for the upfront payment, which was made in February 2025. Hansoh is also eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments associated with the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of MK-4082 (HS-10535) as well as tiered royalties on future net sales of MK-4082 (HS-10535), if approved. Under the agreement, Hansoh may co-promote or solely commercialize MK-4082 (HS-10535) in Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, subject to certain conditions.\nIn September 2024, Merck acquired MK-1045 (formally CN201), a novel investigational clinical-stage bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases, from Curon Biopharmaceutical (Curon) for an upfront payment of $700 million. In addition, Curon is eligible to receive future contingent developmental and regulatory milestone payments. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Merck recorded a charge of $750 million (reflecting the upfront payment and other related costs) to \nResearch and development \nexpenses, or $0.29 per share, in 2024 related to the execution of the transaction. In connection with the agreement, Merck is also obligated to pay a third party future contingent developmental, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales of MK-1045, if approved.\nIn July 2024, Merck acquired EyeBio, a privately held ophthalmology-focused biotechnology company, for $1.2 billion (including payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred $207 million of transaction costs. The acquisition agreement also provides for former EyeBio shareholders to receive future contingent developmental, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments. EyeBio’s lead candidate, MK-3000 (formerly EYE103), is an investigational, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific antibody that acts as an agonist of the Wingless-related integration site signaling pathway, which is in clinical development for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Merck recorded net assets of $21 million, as well as a charge of $1.35 billion to \nResearch and development\n expenses, or $0.52 per share, in 2024 related to the acquisition. Additionally, a $100 million developmental milestone was triggered and paid in 2024 upon initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating MK-3000 for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, which was also recorded as a charge to \nResearch and development\n expenses ($0.04 per share).\nIn March 2024, Merck acquired Harpoon, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases for $765 million and also incurred $56 million of transaction costs. Harpoon’s lead candidate, MK-6070 (formerly HPN328), is a T-cell engager targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), an inhibitory \n62\nTable of Content\ns\ncanonical Notch ligand that is expressed at high levels in small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company recorded net assets of $165 million, as well as a charge of $656 million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses, or $0.26 per share, in 2024 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition. In August 2024, Merck and Daiichi Sankyo expanded their existing global co-development and co-commercialization agreement to include MK-6070. Merck recognized income (recorded within \nOther (income) expense, net\n)\n \nof $170 million, or $0.05 per share, due to the receipt of an upfront cash payment from Daiichi Sankyo and has also satisfied a contingent quid obligation from the original collaboration agreement. \nAcquired In-Process Research and Development\nIn connection with business combinations, the Company records the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. At December 31, 2024, the balance of in-process research and development (IPR&D) was $430 million, primarily consisting of MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $418 million, which is in Phase 3 clinical development.\nThe IPR&D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The time periods to receive approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. Significant delays in the approval process, or the Company’s failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the Company from realizing revenues from these products. Additionally, if the IPR&D programs require additional clinical trial data than previously anticipated, or if the programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the Company will not recover the fair value of the IPR&D recorded as an asset as of the acquisition date. If such circumstances were to occur, the Company’s future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may recognize impairment charges, which could be material.\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded IPR&D impairment charges within \nResearch and development\n expenses of $779 million and $1.6 billion, respectively (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). \nAdditional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. The costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agencies for approval. \nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $3.4 billion in 2024, $3.9 billion in 2023 and $4.4 billion in 2022. Expenditures in the U.S. were $2.4 billion in 2024, $2.5 billion in 2023 and $2.7 billion in 2022. The Company plans to invest approximately $20 billion in capital projects from 2024-2028, more than $11 billion of which relates to investments in the U.S., including expanding manufacturing capacity for oncology, vaccine and animal health products.\nDepreciation expense was $2.1 billion in 2024, $1.8 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022, of which $1.4 billion in 2024, $1.2 billion in 2023 and $1.3 billion in 2022, related to locations in the U.S. Total depreciation expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included accelerated depreciation of $254 million, $140 million and $120 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nMerck’s strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, finance acquisitions and external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders.\nSelected Data\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWorking capital\n$\n10,362\n \n$\n6,474 \n$\n11,483 \nTotal debt to total liabilities and equity\n31.7\n \n%\n32.9 \n%\n28.1 \n%\nCash provided by operating activities to total debt\n0.6:1\n0.4:1\n0.6:1\nCash provided by operating activities was $21.5 billion in 2024 compared with $13.0 billion in 2023 reflecting stronger operating performance. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by upfront, milestone, option and continuation payments related to certain collaborations of $1.1 billion in 2024 compared with $4.2 billion in 2023 (including payments related to the formation of a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo). Cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was also reduced by a payment of $572.5 million for the previously disclosed Zetia antitrust settlement. Cash provided by operating activities continues to be the Company’s primary source of funds to finance \n63\nTable of Content\ns\noperating needs, with excess cash serving as the primary source of funds to finance business development transactions, capital expenditures, dividends paid to shareholders and treasury stock purchases.\nCash used in investing activities was $7.7 billion in 2024 compared with $14.1 billion in 2023. The lower use of cash in investing activities was primarily due to lower cash used for acquisitions, lower capital expenditures, as well as lower purchases of securities and other investments, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of securities and other investments. \nCash used in financing activities was $7.0 billion in 2024 compared with $4.8 billion in 2023. The higher use of cash in financing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance debt (see below) and higher dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by lower payments on long-term debt (see below), higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and lower purchases of treasury stock. \nIn May 2024, MSD Netherlands Capital B.V., a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Merck, completed a registered public offering of €3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-dominated senior notes. The net cash proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes. In May 2023, the Company issued $6.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The Company used a portion of the $5.9 billion net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Prometheus, including related fees and expenses, and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes including to repay commercial paper borrowings and other indebtedness with upcoming maturities.\nIn 2024, the Company’s $750 million, 2.90% notes and the Company’s €500 million, 0.50% euro-denominated notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid. In 2023, the Company’s $1.75 billion, 2.80% notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid. In 2022, the Company’s $1.25 billion, 2.35% notes and the Company’s $1.0 billion, 2.40% notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid. \nThe Company has a $6.0 billion credit facility that matures in May 2028. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company’s commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility.\nIn March 2024, the Company filed a securities registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the automatic shelf registration process available to “well-known seasoned issuers” which is effective for three years.\nEffective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.\nIn November 2024, Merck’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend, declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock for the first quarter of 2025 that was paid in January 2025. In January 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock for the second quarter of 2025 payable in April 2025. \nIn 2018, Merck’s Board of Directors authorized purchases of up to $10 billion of Merck’s common stock for its treasury. The treasury stock purchase authorization has no time limit and will be made over time in open-market transactions, block transactions on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions. In 2024, the Company purchased $1.3 billion (approximately 11 million shares) of its common stock for its treasury under this program. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.4 billion. The Company purchased $1.3 billion of its common stock during 2023 under the authorized share repurchase program. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock under this program in 2022. In January 2025, Merck’s Board of Directors authorized purchases of up to an additional $10 billion of Merck’s common stock for its treasury. \nThe Company believes it maintains a conservative financial profile. The Company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the Company to unrecorded financial obligations.\nThe Company expects foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations, as well as commercial paper borrowings and long-term borrowings if needed. Merck believes that its sources of financing will be adequate to meet its future requirements. The Company’s material cash requirements arising in the normal course of business primarily include:\n64\nTable of Content\ns\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments —\n See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of the Company’s debt obligations and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments. \nTax Liabilities — \nIn connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company is required to pay a one-time transition tax, which the Company has elected to pay over a period of eight years through 2025 as permitted under the TCJA. Additionally, the Company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information pertaining to the transition tax and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. \nOperating Leases — \nSee Note 9 to consolidated financial statements for further details of the Company’s lease obligations and the timing of expected future lease payments.\nCollaboration-Related Payments —\n At December 31, 2024, the Company has accrued liabilities for contingent sales-based milestone payments related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca where the related sales-based milestones were achieved, but payment was not yet due according to the payment terms. These sales-based milestones were subsequently paid in January 2025. Additionally, the Company has an accrued liability for a future continuation payment related to a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these payments.\nPurchase Obligations —\n Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. Purchase obligations also include future inventory purchases the Company has committed to in connection with certain divestitures. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total purchase obligations of $7.2 billion, of which $2.8 billion is estimated to be payable in 2025.\nFinancial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\nA significant portion of the Company’s revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company’s foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and foreign exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options. \nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or \nOther Comprehensive\n \nIncome (Loss)\n (\nOCI)\n, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss \n(\nAOCL)\n and reclassified into \nSales\n when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. The amount reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuation of cash flow hedges because it was no longer deemed probable the forecasted hedged transactions would occur was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. For those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in \nSales\n each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n65\nTable of Content\ns\nBecause Merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging program, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. The market value of Merck’s hedges would have declined by an estimated $569 million and $754 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar. The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck’s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. \nThe Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in \nOther (income) expense, net\n. The Company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of foreign exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the foreign exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument (primarily the euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Chinese renminbi). The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through \nOther (income) expense, net\n. Accordingly, fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than six months. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nA sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currency exposures of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nIncome Before Taxes\n would have declined by approximately $239 million and $221 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Because the Company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. This measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck’s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within \nOCI\n and remain in \nAOCL\n until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded components are recognized in \nOCI\n. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. Certain of the Company’s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within \nOCI\n.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal at risk.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company was a party to six pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of the fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.\n66\nTable of Content\ns\n($ in millions)\n2024\nDebt Instrument\nPar Value of Debt\nNumber of Interest Rate Swaps Held\nTotal Swap Notional Amount\n4.50% notes due 2033\n$\n1,500 \n6 \n$\n1,500 \nThe interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) swap rate. The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate are recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value changes in the swap contracts. In January 2025, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million related to its 5.00% notes due 2053. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company’s medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the Company’s fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. A sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of Merck’s investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. A one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. The fair value of Merck’s debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. The fair values of Merck’s investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nTo determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, the Company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. To be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. \nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. The fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company’s intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to \n67\nTable of Content\ns\nrestructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition. \nThe judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company’s results of operations.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset’s discounted projected net cash flows. The Company’s estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain additional marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the Company’s competitors; and the life of each asset’s underlying patent and related patent term extension, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D are also determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset’s probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each IPR&D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. \nCertain of the Company’s business combinations involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment. \nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date. \nContingent Sales-Based Milestones\nThe terms of certain business development transactions, including collaborative arrangements, licensing agreements and asset acquisitions, require the Company to make payments contingent upon the achievement of sales-based milestones. Sales-based milestones payable by Merck are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined by the Company to be probable of being achieved based on future sales forecasts. The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first regulatory approval for products that were unapproved at the time the transaction was completed or, for new indications of products that were approved prior to the transaction, from the time the transaction was completed. The related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized over its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.\nRevenue Recognition\nRecognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company’s contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n68\nTable of Content\ns\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. For certain services in the Animal Health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. These service revenues are not material.\nThe nature of the Company’s business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts. \nIn the U.S., sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year, sales are recorded net of time value of money discounts, which have not been material. \nThe U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The wholesaler then charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price agreed to between Merck and the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company’s wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. Merck remains committed to the 340B Program and to providing 340B discounts to eligible covered entities. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding 340B legal proceedings.\nSummarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount accrual related to U.S. sales is as follows:\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance January 1\n$\n2,486\n \n$\n2,918 \nCurrent provision\n13,450\n \n12,540 \nAdjustments to prior years\n(139)\n(70)\nPayments\n(13,334)\n(12,902)\nBalance December 31\n$\n2,463\n \n$\n2,486 \nAccruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. The accrued balances relative to these provisions included in \nAccounts receivable\n and \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n were $293 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and were $188 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nOutside of the U.S., variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate of the government’s total unbudgeted spending and the Company’s specific payback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale.\nThe Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic or other competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The product returns \n69\nTable of Content\ns\nprovision for U.S. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of U.S. net pharmaceutical sales was 0.8% in 2024, 1.0% in 2023 and 1.1% in 2022. Outside of the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\nMerck’s payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products have longer payment terms, including \nKeytruda\n, which has payment terms of 90 days. Payment terms for vaccine sales in the U.S. typically range from 30 days to 60 days. Outside of the U.S., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.\nThrough its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.\nInventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches\nThe Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Capitalization of such inventory does not begin until regulatory approval is considered by the Company to be probable. The Company monitors the status of each respective product during the research and regulatory approval process. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $412 million and $790 million, respectively.\nContingencies and Environmental Liabilities\nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property, commercial litigation and securities litigation, as well as certain additional matters, including governmental and environmental matters (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. Generally, for product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company’s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $225 million and $210 million, respectively, represents the Company’s best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. Accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.\n70\nTable of Content\ns\nThe Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs. In the past, Merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. Where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. As definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. These estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually.\nThe Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $4 million in 2024 and are estimated to be $26 million in the aggregate for the years 2025 through 2029. In management’s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $41 million and $42 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $46 million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. This method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. Total pretax share-based compensation expense was $761 million in 2024, $645 million in 2023 and $541 million in 2022. At December 31, 2024, there was $1.1 billion of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. For segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nNet periodic benefit cost for pension plans totaled $107 million in 2024, $126 million in 2023 and $554 million in 2022. Net periodic benefit credit for other postretirement benefit plans was $84 million in 2024, $61 million in 2023 and $93 million in 2022. Pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. The changes in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plans are primarily attributable to lower settlement charges incurred by certain plans in 2024 and 2023 compared with 2022, as well as changes in expected returns and the discount rates.\nThe Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. For both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. The discount rates for the Company’s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 5.50% to 5.70% at December 31, 2024, compared with a range of 5.25% to 5.45% at December 31, 2023.\nThe expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data, current market conditions and actual returns on the Company’s plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2025, the expected rate of return for the Company’s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be 7.70% compared with 7.75% in 2024. \nThe Company has established investment guidelines for its U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Company’s U.S. pension and other \n71\nTable of Content\ns\npostretirement benefit plans is allocated 25% to 40% in U.S. equities, 15% to 30% in international equities, 40% to 50% in fixed-income investments, and up to 8% in cash and other investments. The portfolio’s equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans’ benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 12%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. For international pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. Although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines.\nActuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $45 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the Company’s net periodic benefit cost in 2024. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $57 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on Merck’s net periodic benefit cost in 2024. Required funding obligations for 2025 relating to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. The preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the Company’s funding requirements.\nNet gain/loss amounts, which primarily reflect differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of \nAOCL\n. Expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. Net gain/loss amounts in \nAOCL\n in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. \nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring program activities. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future employee termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations when such separations are probable and estimable. When accruing termination costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. In connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. Severance and employee-related costs, as well as other costs, such as facility shut-down costs, are reflected within \nRestructuring costs\n. Asset-related charges are reflected within \nCost of sales\n, \nSelling, general and administrative\n expenses and \nResearch and development\n expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the Company’s share price. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).\nOther acquired intangible assets (excluding IPR&D) are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or \n72\nTable of Content\ns\ncircumstances warrant a review, the Company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.\nIPR&D that the Company acquires in conjunction with a business combination represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. The Company evaluates IPR&D for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist (such as unfavorable clinical trial data, changes in the commercial landscape or delays in the clinical development program and related regulatory filing and approval timelines), by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset with its carrying value. For impairment testing purposes, the Company may combine separately recorded IPR&D intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, the Company will combine IPR&D intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.\nThe judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the Company’s results of operations.\nTaxes on Income\nThe Company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company’s quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the Company’s quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. The Company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management’s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).\nTax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\nThis report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called “forward-looking statements,” all of which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “will,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “projects” and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company’s growth strategy, financial results, product approvals, product potential, development programs, environmental or other sustainability initiatives. One must carefully consider any \n73\nTable of Content\ns\nsuch statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.\nThe Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on this Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q and 8-K. In Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this annual report on Form 10-K the Company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The Company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.",
