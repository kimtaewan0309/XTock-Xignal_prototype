We operate primarily in the U.S. and are the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of aggregates-intensive downstream products such as asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates which are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.\nDemand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population, employment and household formations. End uses include public construction (e.g., highways, bridges, buildings, airports, schools, prisons, sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects), private nonresidential construction (e.g., manufacturing, retail, offices and warehouses) and private residential construction (e.g., single-family houses, duplexes, apartment buildings and condominiums).\nAggregates have a very high weight-to-price ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available, high-quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to cost-effective long-haul transportation, including shipping by barge, rail and our fleet of Panamax-class, self-unloading ships. Additionally, we serve markets in California and Hawaii from our quarry in British Columbia, Canada by means of a long-term marine shipping agreement with CSL Americas.\nThere are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Due to zoning and permitting regulations and high transportation costs relative to the value of the product, the location of reserves is a critical factor to our long-term success.\nNo material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business. In 2024, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 8% of our total revenues, and no single customer accounted for more than 3%\n \nof our total revenues. Although approximately \n40%\n to \n55%\n of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly-funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, a relatively small portion of our sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly-funded construction, the vast majority of our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with local, state or federal governments. In addition, our sales to government entities span several hundred entities coast-to-coast, ensuring that negative changes to various government budgets would have a muted impact across such a diversified set of government customers.\nWhile aggregates is our focus and primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate attractive financial returns and enhance financial returns in our core Aggregates segment. We produce and sell aggregates-intensive asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete products in our Alabama, Arizona, California, Maryland, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington D.C. markets. Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 80% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In both of these downstream businesses, aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations.\nSEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS\nAlmost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volume of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter, and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic and population fluctuations, and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.\n26\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THIRD QUARTER 2025\nCompared to third quarter of 2024:\n▪\nTotal revenues increased $287.6 million, or 14%, to $2,291.5 million\n▪\nGross profit increased $132.0 million, or 23%, to $697.2 million\n▪\nAggregates segment sales increased $219.7 million, or 14%, to $1,792.1 million\n▪\nAggregates segment freight-adjusted revenues increased $195.7 million, or 16%, to $1,423.7 million\n▪\nShipments increased 12%, or 7.0 million tons, to 64.7 million tons\n▪\nFreight-adjusted sales price increased 3.5%, or $0.74 per ton, to $22.01\n▪\nAggregates segment gross profit increased $113.6 million, or 23%, to $612.1 million\n▪\nUnit profitability (as measured by gross profit per ton) increased 10% to $9.46 per ton\n▪\nAsphalt and Concrete segment gross profit increased $18.4 million to $85.1 million, collectively\n▪\nSelling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses increased $16.2 million and decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of total revenues\n▪\nOperating earnings increased $206.1 million, or 61%, to $543.2 million\n▪\nEarnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations were $2.83 per diluted share compared to $1.57 per diluted share\n▪\nAdjusted earnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations were $2.84 per diluted share compared to $2.22 per diluted share\n▪\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan were $374.9 million, an increase of $167.3 million\n,\n or 81%\n▪\nAdjusted EBITDA was $735.2 million, an increase of $154.6 million, or 27%\n▪\nReturned capital to shareholders via dividends of $64.7 million at $0.49 per share versus $60.8 million at $0.46 per share, an increase of 6%\nThe combination of our aggregates-led business and our commercial and operational execution has resulted in strong earnings growth and margin expansion through the first nine months of 2025. Net earnings attributable to Vulcan has improved 33% over the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA has improved 20% over the prior year, and Adjusted EBITDA margin has expanded 290 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Aggregates gross profit per ton increased 11%, and cash gross profit per ton increased 12% with widespread improvements across our footprint. These results demonstrate the compounding benefits of our strategic disciplines and reinforce our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong earnings growth and cash generation.\nThrough the first nine months, cash provided by operating activities was $1,270.0 million, a 31% increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures for maintenance and growth projects were $234.9 million in the third quarter ($441.8 million on a year-to-date basis), and we returned $64.7 million to shareholders through dividends, a 6% increase versus the prior year. We used $550.0 million of cash on hand to pay down our outstanding commercial paper balance, resulting in a ratio of total debt to trailing-twelve months Adjusted EBITDA of 1.9 times (1.8 times on a net debt basis, reflecting $195.2 million of cash on hand). Our weighted-average debt maturity was 14.0 years, and our total weighted-average effective interest rate was 5.04%.\nInterest expense, net of interest income, was $55.3 million in the third quarter compared with $38.4 million in the prior year. The $16.9 million increase is primarily due to a higher debt level resulting from the November 2024 notes issuances.\nOn a trailing-twelve months basis, return on invested capital improved 40 basis points over the prior year to 16.5% through a combination of solid operating earnings, disciplined capital management and a balanced approach to growth.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we completed the disposition of our asphalt and construction services assets in the greater Houston market. Additionally, on October 28, we entered into an agreement for the disposition of our ready-mixed concrete businesses in California. Subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2025. The sale of these downstream assets is consistent with our aggregates-led strategy and generates cash proceeds that can be redeployed into attractive growth opportunities in the future.\nWe remain well positioned for continued growth with a strong liquidity position and balance sheet profile.\nOUTLOOK\nWe continue to execute well and remain focused on delivering another year of margin expansion and attractive growth in aggregates unit profitability. Aggregates shipments through the third quarter have increased 3%, and we expect full year shipments to reflect similar year-over-year growth. As a result, we expect to deliver between $2,350 million and $2,450 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2025, representing 17% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. \nAs we look to 2026, we are encouraged about the demand backdrop in our markets. We expect continued strength in public construction activity and an improving private nonresidential outlook, a combination that should also benefit an already healthy pricing environment.\nWe are well positioned with an irreplaceable asset base and outstanding talent. Our strategic disciplines on both the commercial and operational sides of our business continue to gain traction and sustain improvements. These competitive advantages, coupled with modest growth in shipments and mid-single digit growth in pricing, will help drive another year of earnings growth in 2026 and expansion in aggregates cash gross profit per ton that continues to exceed historical averages.\n27\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal revenues are primarily derived from our product sales of aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, and include freight & delivery costs that we pass along to our customers to deliver these products. We also generate service revenues from our asphalt construction paving business and services related to our aggregates business. We present separately our discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business.\nThe following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nin millions, except per share and per unit data\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nTotal revenues\n$\n2,291.5 \n$\n2,003.9 \n$\n6,028.5 \n$\n5,564.0 \nCost of revenues\n(1,594.3)\n(1,438.7)\n(4,340.8)\n(4,101.6)\nGross profit\n697.2 \n565.2 \n1,687.7 \n1,462.4 \nGross profit margin\n30.4 \n%\n28.2 \n%\n28.0 \n%\n26.3 \n%\nSelling, administrative and general expenses\n(145.3)\n(129.1)\n(428.0)\n(393.0)\nSAG as a percentage of total revenues\n6.3 \n%\n6.4 \n%\n7.1 \n%\n7.1 \n%\nGain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses\n0.6 \n0.2 \n9.2 \n4.6 \nLoss on impairments\n0.0 \n(86.6)\n0.0 \n(86.6)\nOperating earnings\n543.2 \n337.1 \n1,240.7 \n963.5 \nInterest expense, net\n(55.3)\n(38.4)\n(174.2)\n(117.7)\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes\n488.6 \n294.9 \n1,066.9 \n833.1 \nIncome tax expense\n(112.4)\n(85.2)\n(237.4)\n(208.5)\nEffective tax rate from continuing operations\n23.0 \n%\n28.9 \n%\n22.3 \n%\n25.0 \n%\nEarnings from continuing operations\n376.2 \n209.7 \n829.5 \n624.6 \nLoss on discontinued operations, net of tax\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n(4.2)\n(5.0)\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(0.1)\n(0.8)\n(0.6)\n(1.4)\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan\n$\n374.9 \n$\n207.6 \n$\n824.7 \n$\n618.2 \nDiluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Vulcan\nContinuing operations \n$\n2.83 \n$\n1.57 \n$\n6.24 \n$\n4.68 \nDiscontinued operations\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\n(0.03)\nNet earnings\n$\n2.82 \n$\n1.56 \n$\n6.21 \n$\n4.65 \nEBITDA \n1\n$\n733.5 \n$\n491.3 \n$\n1,798.0 \n$\n1,411.0 \nAdjusted EBITDA \n1\n$\n735.2 \n$\n580.6 \n$\n1,805.6 \n$\n1,507.1 \nAverage Sales Price and Unit Shipments\n Aggregates\nTons\n64.7 \n57.7 \n171.7 \n166.0 \nFreight-adjusted sales price\n$\n22.01 \n$\n21.27 \n$\n22.05 \n$\n20.98 \n Asphalt Mix\nTons\n4.3 \n4.1 \n10.4 \n10.2 \nAverage sales price\n$\n82.70 \n$\n80.88 \n$\n81.88 \n$\n79.42 \n Ready-mixed concrete\nCubic yards\n1.2 \n0.9 \n3.3 \n2.7 \nAverage sales price\n$\n190.90 \n$\n185.61 \n$\n188.96 \n$\n182.88 \n1\nNon-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled within this Item 2 under the caption \"\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\".\n28\nTHIRD QUARTER 2025 COMPARED TO THIRD QUARTER 2024\nThird quarter 2025 total revenues were $2,291.5 million, up 14% from the third quarter of 2024. Shipments increased in aggregates (+12%), asphalt mix (+5%) and ready-mixed concrete (+32%). Gross profit increased in the Aggregates segment (+$113.6 million or 23%), the Asphalt segment (+$10.8 million or 18%) and the Concrete segment (+$7.6 million or 113%).\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan for the third quarter of 2025 were $374.9 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, compared to $207.6 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024. Each period’s results were impacted by discrete items, as follows:\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan for the third quarter of 2025 include:\n▪\npretax charges of $0.1 million associated with non-routine acquisitions\n▪\npretax loss on discontinued operations of $1.6 million\n▪\n$1.8 million of tax charges related to a valuation allowance against Calica deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan for the third quarter of 2024 include:\n▪\npretax charges of $86.6 million associated with a goodwill impairment\n▪\npretax charges of $0.8 million associated with non-routine acquisitions\n▪\npretax loss on discontinued operations of $1.8 million\n▪\n$1.9 million of tax charges related to a valuation allowance against Calica deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards\nAdjusted for these discrete items, earnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations (Adjusted Diluted EPS) was $2.84 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.22 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024.\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS — Changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the third quarter of 2025 versus the third quarter of 2024 are summarized below:\nin millions\nThird quarter 2024\n$\n294.9 \nHigher aggregates gross profit\n113.6 \nHigher asphalt gross profit\n10.8 \nHigher concrete gross profit\n7.6 \nHigher selling, administrative and general expenses\n(16.2)\nLower impairment charges\n86.6 \nHigher interest expense, net\n(16.9)\nAll other\n8.2 \nThird quarter 2025\n$\n488.6 \nSolid execution in the third quarter drove strong earnings growth and margin expansion. Aggregates segment gross profit increased 23% to $612.1 million ($9.46 on a per ton basis), and gross profit margin expanded 250 basis points to to 34.2%. Cash gross profit per ton increased 9% to $11.84 per ton. On a trailing-twelve months basis, cash gross profit per ton was $11.51, increasing 13% over the prior year and marking the eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit compounding improvement in unit profitability.\nAggregates shipments increased 12% compared to the prior year, reflecting healthy public construction activity, as well as the benefit of more favorable weather in most markets. Shipments in the prior year's third quarter were disrupted by numerous hurricanes and severe storms across the Southeast. \nFreight-adjusted selling prices increased 3.5% compared to the prior year (5.0% on a mix-adjusted basis). Reported price in the quarter was impacted by unfavorable product mix, as well as the anticipated impact of recent acquisitions. Freight-adjusted unit cost of sales decreased 1% (decreased 2% on a unit cash cost of sales basis) as a result of continued operating cost discipline and the benefit of strong shipments in the quarter. On a trailing-twelve months basis, unit cash cost of sales approximated the prior year, reflecting a continued focus on cost management and operating efficiencies.\nOverall, non-aggregates segments gross profit of $85.1 million was $18.4 million higher than the prior year’s third quarter.\n \nAsphalt segment gross profit was $71.0 million (an 18% improvement over the prior year), and cash gross profit was $83.9 million (a 16% improvement over the prior year). Gross profit margin remained strong and expanded to 17%. Gross profit per ton increased 12%, and cash gross profit per ton improved 10%.\nConcrete segment gross profit was $14.1 million, and cash gross profit was $30.6 million. Gross profit margin expanded to 6%, unit gross profit increased 62%, and unit cash gross profit increased 34%, benefiting from the profitability of acquired operations.\nSAG expense was $145.3 million for the third quarter compared to $129.1 million in the prior year. The increase in the current year was primarily due to SAG expense for prior year business acquisitions and higher incentives expense. For the quarter, SAG expense as a percent of total revenues improved slightly to 6.3%. On a trailing-twelve months basis, SAG expense was 7.2% of total revenues, unchanged from the prior year.\nGain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses was $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n29\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we recorded an $86.6 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to a reporting unit that included concrete operations acquired from U.S. Concrete in 2021 ($84.2 million after tax). There were no similar charges in the third quarter of 2025.\nOther operating income (expense), net which is composed primarily of idle facilities expense, environmental remediation costs, gain (loss) on settlement of AROs, finance charges collected, and rental income, was $9.3 million of expense for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $12.6 million of expense in the third quarter of 2024.\nOther nonoperating income (expense), net was $0.7 million of income for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $3.8 million of expense in the third quarter of 2024.\nNet interest expense was $55.3 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $38.4 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher debt level resulting from the November 2024 notes issuances.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations was $112.4 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $85.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to the increase in pretax earnings, partially offset by the nondeductible portion of the loss on impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\nEarnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations were $2.83 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $1.57 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS — Third quarter pretax loss from discontinued operations was $1.6 million in 2025 compared with a pretax loss of $1.8 million in 2024. Both periods include charges related to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business. For additional details, see \nNote 1\n to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption Discontinued Operations.\n30\nYEAR-TO-DATE SEPTEMBER 30, 2025 COMPARED TO YEAR-TO-DATE SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\nTotal revenues for the first nine months of 2025 were $6,028.5 million, up 8% from the first nine months of 2024. Shipments increased in aggregates (+3%), asphalt mix (+2%) and ready-mixed concrete (+25%). Gross profit increased in the Aggregates segment (+$198.7 million or 15%), the Asphalt segment (+$9.0 million or 7%) and the Concrete segment (+$17.6 million or 213%).\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan for the first nine months of 2025 were $824.7 million, or $6.21 per diluted share, compared to $618.2 million, or $4.65 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2024. Each period’s results were impacted by discrete items, as follows:\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan for the first nine months of 2025 include:\n▪\npretax charges of $1.9 million associated with non-routine acquisitions\n▪\npretax loss on discontinued operations of $5.7 million\n▪\n$5.6 million of tax charges related to a valuation allowance against Calica deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards\nNet earnings attributable to Vulcan for the first nine months of 2024 include:\n▪\npretax charges of $86.6 million associated with a goodwill impairment\n▪\npretax charges of $1.0 million associated with divested operations\n▪\npretax charges of $1.8 million associated with non-routine acquisitions\n▪\npretax loss on discontinued operations of $6.8 million\n▪\n$4.5 million of tax charges related to a valuation allowance against Calica deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards\nAdjusted for these discrete items, earnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations (Adjusted Diluted EPS) was $6.29 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2025 compared to $5.37 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2024.\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS — Changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for year-to-date September 30, 2025 versus year-to-date September 30, 2024 are summarized below:\nin millions\nYear-to-date September 30, 2024\n$\n833.1 \nHigher aggregates gross profit\n198.7 \nHigher asphalt gross profit\n9.0 \nHigher concrete gross profit\n17.6 \nHigher selling, administrative and general expenses\n(35.0)\nHigher gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses\n4.6 \nLower impairment charges\n86.6 \nHigher interest expense, net\n(56.5)\nAll other\n8.8 \nYear-to-date September 30, 2025\n$\n1,066.9 \nAggregates segment sales for the first nine months of 2025 were $4,777.5 million (up 7%), and shipments increased 3%, or 5.7 million tons, compared to the prior year. Aggregates segment gross profit was $1,529.0 million ($8.91 per ton) in the first nine months of 2025 versus $1,330.3 million ($8.01 per ton) in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, cash gross profit per ton increased 12% to $11.52 per ton.\nFreight-adjusted selling prices increased 5.1% compared to the prior year (6.6% on a mix-adjusted basis), with growth widespread across our footprint. Freight-adjusted unit cost of sales for the first nine months of 2025 decreased 1% versus the prior year, reflecting a continued focus on cost management and operating efficiencies. \nAsphalt segment gross profit of $132.9 million was up $9.0 million from the first nine months of 2024, and cash gross profit of $171.9 million was a 10% improvement over the prior year. Asphalt mix shipments increased 2%, and average unit selling prices increased 3%, or $2.46 per ton.\nConcrete segment gross profit of $25.8 million was up $17.6 million from the first nine months of 2024, and cash gross profit of $76.7 million was a 78% increase from the prior year.  \nSAG expenses were $428.0 million in the first nine months of 2025 versus $393.0 million in the first nine months of 2024. As a percent of total revenues, SAG expense was 7.1%, unchanged from the prior year's first nine months.\nGain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses was $9.2 million in the first nine months of 2025 versus $4.6 million in the first nine months of 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an $86.6 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to a reporting unit that included concrete operations acquired from U.S. Concrete in 2021 ($84.2 million after tax). There were no similar charges in the first nine months of 2025.\n31\nOther operating income (expense), net which is composed primarily of idle facilities expense, environmental remediation costs, gain (loss) on settlement of AROs, finance charges collected, and rental income, was $28.2 million of expense for the first nine months of 2025 compared to $23.9 million of expense in the first nine months of 2024.\nOther nonoperating income (expense), net was $0.4 million of income for the first nine months of 2025 compared to $12.7 million of expense in the first nine months of 2024. The year-over-year improvement was primarily related to higher foreign currency transaction gains in the current year.\nNet interest expense was $174.2 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to $117.7 million in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher debt level resulting from the November 2024 notes issuances.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations was $237.4 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to $208.5 million in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to the increase in pretax earnings, partially offset by the nondeductible portion of the loss on impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was further offset by an increase in the statutory depletion deduction and the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of a Canadian subsidiary in 2025.\nEarnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations were $6.24 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2025 compared to $4.68 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2024.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS — First nine months pretax loss from discontinued operations was $5.7 million in 2025 compared with a pretax loss of $6.8 million in 2024. Both periods include charges related to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business. For additional details, see \nNote 1\n to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption Discontinued Operations.\nKNOWN TRENDS OR UNCERTAINTIES\nInflationary pressures and labor constraints can be factors that impact our operations. Although inflationary pressures can create short-term to medium-term headwinds, the combination of inflation and visibility of demand may create a favorable environment for price increases. Additionally, labor constraints can cause delays and inefficiencies in our operations as well as those of our customers. If labor constraints continue, our operations may proceed at a slower pace, which may effectively extend the recovery while allowing us the opportunity to compound price, control costs and grow earnings.\nOur industry is experiencing uncertainty due to rapid changes in global trade policies including announced tariff increases, potential additional tariff increases and other measures that could restrict international trade. Economic pressures on our customers, including the challenges of inflation and the impact of tariffs and other trade measures, may negatively impact our shipment volumes. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business.\nFurther, the Mexican government has taken actions adverse to our property and operations in Mexico. On May 5, 2022, Mexican government officials presented employees at our Calica operations in Quintana Roo, Mexico with arbitrary shutdown orders to immediately cease underwater quarrying and extraction operations. On May 13, 2022, the Mexican government suspended the three-year customs permit granted in March 2022 to Calica. In September 2024, the Mexican government ordered the closure of Calica's already-suspended quarrying activities and the shutdown of certain activities at Calica's Punta Venado port facilities. On September 23, 2024, the President of Mexico signed a presidential decree declaring the entirety of Calica's properties as a \"Natural Protected Area\" (the \"ANP Decree\"). Among other provisions, the ANP Decree prohibits Calica from extracting petrous or construction materials from its properties. We strongly believe that the actions taken by Mexico are arbitrary and illegal, and we intend to vigorously pursue all lawful avenues available to us in order to protect our rights, under both Mexican and international law. For additional information regarding our Calica operations, see the NAFTA Arbitration section in \nNote 8\n to the \ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\n32\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAGGREGATES SEGMENT FREIGHT-ADJUSTED REVENUES\nAggregates segment freight-adjusted revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We present this measure as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities.

We and the investment community use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business. Additionally, we present this metric as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. Cash gross profit adds back noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization to gross profit. Segment cash gross profit per unit is computed by dividing segment cash gross profit by units shipped. Segment cash cost of sales per unit is computed by subtracting segment cash gross profit per unit from segment freight-adjusted sales price. Segment freight-adjusted sales price is calculated by dividing revenues generated from the shipment of product (excluding service revenues generated by the segments) by the total units of the product shipped.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric EBITDA. We believe that our ROIC metric is meaningful because it helps investors assess how effectively we are deploying our assets. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies.

For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities, a substantial, committed bank line of credit and our commercial paper program. Additional sources of capital include access to the capital markets, the sale of surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets. We believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our business requirements for 2025 including:\n▪\ncontractual obligations\n▪\ncapital expenditures\n▪\ndebt service obligations\n▪\ndividend payments\n▪\npotential acquisitions\n▪\npotential share repurchases\nOur balanced approach to capital deployment remains unchanged. We intend to balance reinvestment in our business, growth through acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders, while sustaining financial strength and flexibility.\nWe actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to balance the cost of capital and the risk of financial stress. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:\n▪\nmaintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity\n▪\nproactively manage our debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low\n▪\nmaintain an appropriate balance of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt\n▪\nminimize financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility\n37\nCASH\nIncluded in our September 30, 2025 cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances of $195.2 million is $3.9 million of restricted cash as described in \nNote 1\n to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Restricted Cash\".\nCASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nin millions\n2025\n2024\nNet earnings\n$\n825.3 \n$\n619.6 \nDepreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization\n563.2 \n468.4 \nLoss on impairments\n0.0 \n86.6 \nNoncash operating lease expense\n40.1 \n38.6 \nNet gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses\n(9.2)\n(4.6)\nDeferred income taxes, net\n56.5 \n(30.3)\nOther operating cash flows, net \n1\n(205.9)\n(208.8)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,270.0 \n$\n969.5 \n \n1\nPrimarily reflects changes to working capital balances.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,270.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a $300.5 million increase compared to the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher cash earnings in 2025 ($205.7 million higher net earnings in addition to $94.8 million higher non-cash depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization), partially offset by an $86.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in 2024.\nDays sales outstanding, a measurement of the time it takes to collect receivables, were 42.4 days at September 30, 2025 compared to 43.3 days at September 30, 2024. Additionally, our over 90 day receivables balance was $29.2 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $2.9 million from the $26.3 million balance at September 30, 2024. All customer accounts are actively managed, and no losses in excess of amounts reserved are currently expected.\nCASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nNet cash used for investing activities was $450.9 million during the first nine months of 2025, a $190.9 million decrease compared to the same period of 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, we acquired businesses for $206.4 million, whereas there were no business acquisitions in the first nine months of 2025 (see \nNote 16\n to the condensed consolidated financial statements). During the first nine months of 2025, we invested $492.9 million in our existing operations (includes changes in accruals for property, plant & equipment) compared to $441.0 million in the prior year period. This $492.9 million investment includes both maintenance and internal growth projects to enhance our distribution capabilities, develop new production sites and improve existing production facilities.\nCASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nNet cash used for financing activities was $1,224.7 million during the first nine months of 2025, a $382.1 million increase compared to cash used of $842.6 million in the same period of 2024. The current year includes $400.0 million cash paid to redeem the senior notes due 2025 and $550.0 million to pay down the commercial paper balance, whereas the prior year includes cash paid to redeem the $550.0 million senior notes due 2026. Additionally, we returned $233.5 million to shareholders through $195.4 million of dividends ($1.47 per share compared to $1.38 per share) and $38.1 million of common stock repurchases (170,000 shares repurchased at $224.36 average price per share in 2025 compared to 270,142 shares repurchased at $254.71 average price per share in 2024).\n38\nDEBT\nCertain debt measures are presented below:\nin millions\nSeptember 30\n 2025\nDecember 31\n2024\nSeptember 30\n 2024\nDebt\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n$\n0.4 \n$\n400.5 \n$\n0.5 \nLong-term debt\n4,360.4 \n4,906.9 \n3,329.2 \nTotal debt\n$\n4,360.8 \n$\n5,307.4 \n$\n3,329.7 \nCapital\nTotal debt\n$\n4,360.8 \n$\n5,307.4 \n$\n3,329.7 \nTotal equity\n8,757.1 \n8,142.5 \n7,893.1 \nTotal capital\n$\n13,117.9 \n$\n13,449.9 \n$\n11,222.8 \nTotal Debt as a Percentage of Total Capital\n33.2\n%\n39.5\n%\n29.7\n%\nWeighted-Average Effective Interest Rates\n  Line of credit \n1\n1.13\n%\n1.13\n%\n1.13\n%\n  Commercial paper\nN/A  \n4.65\n%\n5.02\n%\n  Term debt\n5.04\n%\n5.00\n%\n4.63\n%\nFixed Versus Floating Interest Rate Debt\n  Fixed-rate debt\n100.0\n%\n89.8\n%\n83.8\n%\n  Floating-rate debt\n0.0\n%\n10.2\n%\n16.2\n%\n \n1\nReflects the margin above SOFR for SOFR-based borrowings; we also paid upfront fees that are amortized to interest expense and pay fees for unused borrowing capacity and standby letters of credit.\nAt September 30, 2025, total debt to trailing-twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was 1.9 times (1.8 times on a net debt basis reflecting $195.2 million of cash on hand). Our weighted-average debt maturity was 14.0 years, and our total weighted-average effective interest rate was 5.04%.\nLINE OF CREDIT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM\nOur $1,600.0 million unsecured commercial paper program was established in August 2022 and matures in November 2029. Our commercial paper is fully back-stopped by our line of credit and contains covenants customary for an unsecured investment-grade facility. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with the commercial paper covenants. Commercial paper borrowings bear interest at rates determined at the time of borrowing and as agreed between us and the commercial paper investors. As of September 30, 2025, there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nOur $1,600.0 million unsecured line of credit was amended in November 2024 to extend the maturity date from August 2027 to November 2029. Our line of credit contains covenants customary for an unsecured investment-grade facility. Covenants, borrowings, cost ranges and other details are described in \nNote 7\n to the condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with the covenants, the margin for SOFR borrowings was 1.125%, the margin for base rate borrowings was 0.125% and the commitment fee for the unused amount was 0.100%.\nAs of September 30, 2025, our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was $1,576.7 million. Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows:\n▪\nNone was borrowed\n▪\n$23.3 million was used to support standby letters of credit\nTERM DEBT\nAll of our $4,440.5 million (face value) of term debt is unsecured. All of the covenants in the debt agreements are customary for investment-grade facilities. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all term debt covenants.\nIn November 2024, we issued $500.0 million of 4.95% senior notes due 2029, $750.0 million of 5.35% senior notes due 2034 and $750.0 million of 5.70% senior notes due 2054. Total proceeds of $1,975.0 million (net of discounts and transaction costs), together with cash on hand, were used to provide liquidity for acquisitions in 2024 and debt maturing in 2025.\nIn March 2025, we redeemed the $400.0 million senior notes due April 2025 using cash on hand\n.\n39\nCURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT\nThe $0.4 million of current maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2025 is due as follows: \nin millions\nCurrent \nMaturities \nFourth quarter 2025\n$\n0.0 \nFirst quarter 2026\n0.4 \nSecond quarter 2026\n0.0 \nThird quarter 2026\n0.0 \nDEBT RATINGS\nOur debt ratings and outlooks as of September 30, 2025 are as follows:\nShort-term\nLong-term\nOutlook\nFitch\nF1\nBBB+\nStable\nMoody's\nP-2\nBaa2\nStable\nStandard & Poor's\nA-2\nBBB+\nStable\nEQUITY\nThe number of our common stock issuances and purchases for the year-to-date periods ended are as follows:\nin millions\nSeptember 30\n2025\nDecember 31\n2024\nSeptember 30\n2024\nCommon stock shares at January 1, issued and outstanding\n132.1\n132.1\n132.1\nCommon stock issued for share-based compensation plans\n0.1\n0.3\n0.3\nCommon stock purchased and retired\n(0.2)\n(0.3)\n(0.3)\nCommon stock shares at end of period, issued and outstanding\n132.0\n132.1\n132.1\nAs of September 30, 2025, there were 6,647,118 shares remaining under the February 2017 share purchase authorization by our Board of Directors.

A summary of these policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Form 10-K).\nWe prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies.
