BUSINESS. \nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nIron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\"IMI\"), was founded in an underground facility near Hudson, New York in 1951 where it stored business records. Today, we are a global leader in information management services, and we are trusted by more than 240,000 customers in 61 countries, including approximately 95% of the Fortune 1000, to help unlock value and intelligence from their assets through services that transcend the physical and digital worlds. Our broad range of solutions address their information management, digital transformation, information security, data center and asset lifecycle management (“ALM”) needs. Our longstanding commitment to safety, security, sustainability and innovation in support of our customers underpins everything we do. We currently serve customers across an array of market verticals — commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, technology, insurance, life sciences, energy, business services, entertainment and government organizations. \nWe are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") and are a constituent of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (\"MSCI\") REIT index and the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Real Estate Index. As of December 31, 2024, we were number 604 on the Fortune 1000. We have been organized and have operated as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nOVERVIEW\nOur company has been a market leader in the physical ecosystem supporting information storage and retrieval, as most businesses have relied on paper documents or computer tapes to store their valuable information. Over time, customers are increasing their digital information, with the new information storage ecosystem being a hybrid of physical and digital media. We have evolved our business to meet our customers' needs while remaining focused on driving growth supported by our four pillars outlined below.\nContinued revenue growth in physical storage through revenue management actions as well as volume growth achieved in faster growing markets and our consumer business, as well as complementary business growth\n•\nWe are establishing and enhancing leadership positions in higher-growth markets such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\n•\nWe continue to identify, acquire, incubate and scale complementary businesses and products to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. These opportunities include our Global Digital Solutions, ALM, Fine Arts and Consumer Storage (each as defined below) businesses.\nUtilizing our global scale as well as over 70 years of customer trust to deliver differentiated data center offerings\n•\nWe have made significant progress in scaling our Global Data Center Business through acquisitions and organic growth, with 29 operating data centers across 21 global markets, either directly or through unconsolidated joint ventures. \n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had leased approximately 96% of the existing 416 megawatt (\"MW\") capacity of our data centers. With a total potential capacity of 1,280 MW in land and buildings currently owned or operated by us, we are among the largest global data center operators.\nEstablishing and maintaining a leadership position in critical digital infrastructure as well as developing and offering new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management solutions in an increasingly hybrid physical and digital world\n•\nWe are positioned to take advantage of the secular growth trends of the changing nature of digital infrastructure. We continue to scale our Global Digital Solutions business to complement our existing offerings in records and information management, ALM, and our Global Data Center business in order to respond to our customers’ growing interest and need to react to environmental, social and corporate governance considerations. This full suite of complementary businesses puts Iron Mountain in a unique position to cross sell our products and services to our customers.\n•\nOur customers are faced with navigating a more complex regulatory environment, and one in which hybrid physical and digital solutions have become the norm. Our strategy is underpinned by our persistent focus on best-in-class customer experience, as we continue to seek innovative solutions to help our customers progress on their journey from physical storage to a digital ecosystem.\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\n1\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nContinued investment in our growth agenda, our business and customer-centric solutions\n•\nWe have established an investment strategy to fuel our growth. The investments we outlined in our plan for Project Matterhorn (as defined below) have been informed by our established leadership position in the physical storage business, our expanding services such as Global Digital Solutions and ALM and our significant progress in the Global Data Center Business.\nPROJECT MATTERHORN\nIn September 2022, we announced a global program designed to accelerate the growth of our business (\"Project Matterhorn\"). Project Matterhorn investments focus on transforming our operating model to a global operating model. Project Matterhorn focuses on the formation of a solution-based sales approach that is designed to allow us to optimize our shared services and best practices to better serve our customers' needs. We are investing to accelerate growth and to capture a greater share of the large, global addressable markets in which we operate. We have incurred approximately $378.5 million in Restructuring and other transformation costs from the inception of Project Matterhorn through December 31, 2024. We expect to incur approximately $150.0 million in costs related to Project Matterhorn during the year ending December 31, 2025, at which point the program is expected to be completed. Costs are comprised of (1) restructuring costs, which include (i) site consolidation and other related exit costs, (ii) employee severance costs and (iii) certain professional fees associated with these activities, and (2) other transformation costs, which include professional fees such as project management costs and costs for third party consultants who are assisting in the enablement of our growth initiatives. Total costs related to Project Matterhorn during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $161.4 million and $175.2 million, respectively.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe amount of revenues derived from our business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, are set forth in Note 11 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nGLOBAL RIM BUSINESS\nThe Global Records and Information Management (\"Global RIM\") Business segment includes several distinct offerings. \nRecords Management,\n stores physical records and provides information services, vital records services, courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents (\"Records Management\") for customers in 61 countries around the globe.\nData Management, \nprovides storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations, server and computer backup services and related services offerings (\"Data Management\").\nGlobal Digital Solutions, \ndevelops, implements and supports comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers’ information, including the management of physical records, conversion of documents to digital formats and digital storage of information (\"Global Digital Solutions\"). In August 2024, we launched the InSight Digital Experience Platform (also referred to as DXP), a secure, software-as-a-service platform designed to automate customer workflows, enhance data accessibility, ensure audit compliance and optimize customer data for AI applications.\nSecure Shredding,\n includes the scheduled pick-up of office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide and is a natural extension of our hardcopy records management operations, completing the lifecycle of a record. Through a combination of shredding facilities and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers.\nMedia and Archive Services,\n includes entertainment and media services, which help industry clients store, safeguard and deliver physical media of all types, and provides digital content repository systems that house, distribute and archive key media assets.\nConsumer Storage, \nprovides on-demand, valet storage for consumers (\"Consumer Storage\") utilizing data analytics and machine learning to provide effective customer acquisition and a convenient and seamless consumer storage experience.\n2\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Part I\nGLOBAL DATA CENTER BUSINESS\nThe Global Data Center Business segment provides enterprise-class data center facilities and hyperscale-ready capacity to protect mission-critical assets and ensure the continued operation of our customers’ IT infrastructure with secure, reliable and flexible data center options.

Our mission-critical storage offerings and related services generated approximately $6.1 billion in annual revenue in 2024. Our business has a highly diverse customer base of more than 240,000 customers - with no single customer accounting for more than approximately 1% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 - and operates in 61 countries globally. This presents a significant cross-sell opportunity for our expanding solutions, including digital, data center and ALM.\nRecurring, Durable \nRevenue Stream\nA majority of our revenue is recurring in nature. In our Records Management business, our contracted storage rental fee agreements generally range from one to five years in length. As of December 31, 2024, we stored more than 730 million cubic feet of physical volume and we have consistently experienced strong customer retention levels. In our Global Data Center Business, our lease durations vary by customer, with a weighted average lease expiration of 10.6 years as of December 31, 2024.\nComprehensive Information\nManagement Solution\nAs an S&P 500 REIT with approximately 1,350 locations globally and with offerings spanning physical storage, digitization solutions and digital storage, we are positioned to provide a holistic offering to our customers. We are able to cater to our customers’ physical and digital needs and to help guide their digital transformation journey.\nSignificant Owner and Operator\nof Real Estate\nWe operate approximately 98 million square feet of real estate worldwide. Our owned real estate footprint spans to over 24 million square feet.\nLimited Revenue Cyclicality\nHistorically, economic downturns have not significantly affected our storage rental business. Due to the durability of our total global physical volumes, the success of our revenue management initiatives and the growth of our Global Data Center Business, we believe we can continue to grow organic storage rental revenue over time.\nShifting Revenue Mix\nWe have identified a number of areas where we see opportunity for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers. These business lines, including Global Data Center, ALM and Global Digital Solutions, represent markets with strong, secular growth.\n4\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Part I\nIn addition, our Global Data Center Business has the following attributes:\nLarge Data Center\nPlatform with Significant\nExpansion Opportunity\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 416 MW of leasable capacity with an additional 864 MW under construction or held for development.\nDifferentiated Compliance\nand Security\nWe offer comprehensive compliance support as well as physical and cybersecurity. Our Security-in-Depth strategy integrates both technical and human security measures, with oversight provided by senior security leaders with military and public sector backgrounds. As of December 31, 2024, our data center portfolio has achieved numerous certifications and received third party assurance reports, making it one of the most comprehensive compliance programs in the industry. These certifications and reports on compliance include the global ISO 27001, ISO 22301, ISO 9001, SOC 2 and PCI-DSS standards, as well as HIPAA, NIST 800-53 and FISMA HIGH in the United States. The program also includes enterprise-wide certified ISO 14001 and 50001 environmental and energy management systems and complies with ISO 14064 for greenhouse gas emissions, supporting our commitment to sustainability.\nEfficient Access\nand Flexibility\nWe have the ability to provide customers with a range of deployment options from one cabinet to an entire building, leveraging our global portfolio of hyperscale-ready and underground data centers. We also provide access to numerous carriers, cloud providers and peering exchanges with migration support.\n100% Clean Energy\nData Centers\nWe have matched 100% of the energy consumption in our data centers with clean energy annually since 2017. This approach enables our Green Power Pass offering, which allows customers to report the power they consume at any Iron Mountain Data Center as clean power in their public reporting, making Iron Mountain a key part of their decarbonization roadmaps and goals. Our data center business is a founding signatory to the UN Compact on 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (“CFE”), which seeks hour-by-hour matching of site consumption with local CFE by 2040.\nCOMPETITION\nWe face competition from numerous storage and information management services providers globally, as well as storage and information management services that are managed and operated internally by organizations. Competition for records and information customers is driven by factors such as pricing, reputation and reliability, the quality and security of storage solutions and the scope and scale of technology. While the majority of our competitors operate in only one market or region, we believe we provide a differentiated global offering that competes effectively in these areas.\nWe also compete with numerous data center developers, owners and operators, many of whom own properties comparable to ours in several of the same metropolitan areas where our facilities are located. We believe that competition for data center customers is based on availability of power, security measures, location, connectivity and rental rates, and we are confident in our ability to compete effectively in each of these areas. Additionally, we believe our strong brand, global footprint and excellent commercial relationships empower us to compete successfully and provide significant cross-selling opportunities with our existing customer base.\nIn our ALM business, we compete with both hyperscalers and individual corporate clients who manage their own asset recycling, disposition and management, in addition to external competitors.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 11,150 employees in the United States and approximately 17,700 employees outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 375 employees were represented by unions in North America and approximately 1,375 employees were represented by unions in Latin America. All union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement.\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\n5\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nBENEFIT PROGRAMS\nWe provide our employees with benefits that are designed to support their overall physical, financial, emotional and social well-being. These benefits vary by location but generally include health and welfare benefits, paid time off and programs to support financial security. Additionally, employees are able to access emotional well-being resources through global employee assistance programs. Certain unionized employees receive benefits through unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, a significant portion of full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits or attainment of specific objectives for the unit in which they work. \nCOMPANY CULTURE\nWe are committed to making a meaningful impact on our customers, our people and our business by cultivating a culture that is firmly grounded in our values: \nActing with Integrity, Owning Safety and Security, Building Customer Value, Taking Ownership and Promoting Inclusion and Teamwork\n. \nWhile we foster an environment of learning, collaboration, diversity and wellbeing, we know culture truly thrives in the everyday experience of working at Iron Mountain. \nOur culture encourages open communication and innovation while fostering trust, engagement and exceptional performance. We evaluate this through regular employee surveys and by leveraging data to gain a deeper understanding of our global workforce, and how they work. These insights collectively enable us to drive enhanced employee engagement, measure effectiveness and refine our approach for sustained success.\nLed by our President and CEO, William Meaney, our Inclusive Leadership Alliance (the \"Alliance\") includes members of the Executive Leadership Team and plays a pivotal role in advancing our culture and driving growth. The Alliance reviews and supports key initiatives, monitors progress toward enterprise goals, ensures accountability through measurable targets and communicates achievements to stakeholders.\nOur volunteer-based global employee resource groups play an essential role in supporting talent attraction, retention and development, and serving as valuable allies across our company. Each group is sponsored by one or more members of Iron Mountain’s Executive Leadership Team.\nCOMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT\nWe are committed to integrating responsible and sustainable practices throughout our organization to help our operations have a positive impact on the environment and the communities in which we operate. We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer philanthropic support to our global community through our Living Legacy Initiative, which is our commitment to help preserve and make accessible cultural and historical information and artifacts. We encourage volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work through our Moving Mountains volunteer program, offering paid time off for employees to help community-based and civic-minded organizations.\nINSURANCE\nFor strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and which have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers’ compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, cyber, warehouse legal liability and directors’ and officers’ liability policies.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters which may have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.\n6\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Part I\nFor example, some of our currently and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken environmental reviews of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.\nWe transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.\nIn addition, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity, which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have an established global privacy compliance framework and devote substantial resources, and may in the future have to devote significant additional resources, to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations or breaches. Any failure by us to comply with, or remedy any violations or breaches of, these laws and regulations could negatively impact our operations, result in the imposition of fines and penalties, liability and litigation, significant costs and expenses and reputational harm.\nFor more information about laws and regulations that could affect our business, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nAt Iron Mountain, we are using our influence and expertise to drive innovations that protect and elevate the effectiveness of our customers’ endeavors, while also creating a meaningful, positive impact on individuals, the environment, and our overall performance. Iron Mountain is committed to sustainable growth, and this is highlighted through initiatives and targets within our company. We aim to minimize our environmental impact, foster a culture and processes that support the well-being of our global teams, and to be a catalyst for positive change within our communities.\nWe transparently report on our sustainability efforts and the advancement of our objectives by using widely adopted reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative, CDP and EcoVadis. In addition, we continue to further align our reporting with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\nOur work continues to receive recognition. In 2024, the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\") validated our targets, which are aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement aspiration of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our data center team was recognized with the Decarbonization of Electricity award from BroadGroup International for their work and thought leadership on carbon-free energy.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we are a constituent of multiple indexes that focus on corporate sustainability standards, including several MSCI All Country World Indexes (ACWI), such as the ACWI Low Carbon Leaders, ACWI Climate Paris Aligned, ACWI ESG Leaders and ACWI Socially Responsible Index (SRI).

Project Matterhorn investments focus on transforming our operating model to a global operating model. Project Matterhorn focuses on the formation of a solution-based sales approach that is designed to allow us to optimize our shared services and best practices to better serve our customers' needs. We are investing to accelerate growth and to capture a greater share of the large, global addressable markets in which we operate. We have incurred approximately $378.5 million in Restructuring and other transformation costs from the inception of Project Matterhorn through December 31, 2024. We expect to incur approximately $150.0 million in costs related to Project Matterhorn during the year ending December 31, 2025, at which point the program is expected to be completed. Costs are comprised of (1) restructuring costs, which include (i) site consolidation and other related exit costs, (ii) employee severance costs and (iii) certain professional fees associated with these activities, and (2) other transformation costs, which include professional fees such as project management costs and costs for third party consultants who are assisting in the enablement of our growth initiatives. The following chart presents (in thousands) total Restructuring and other transformation costs related to Project Matterhorn from the inception of Project Matterhorn through December 31, 2024 and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFrom the Inception of Project\nMatterhorn through\nDecember 31, 2024\n     \nFor the Year ended\nDecember 31, 2024\n     \nFor the Year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\n     \nGENERAL\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - KEY TRENDS\n \n•\nOur organic storage rental revenue growth is primarily driven by revenue management in our Global RIM Business segment, where we expect volume to be relatively stable in the near term, as well as by growth in our Global Data Center Business segment, primarily driven by lease commencements.\n•\nOur organic service revenue growth is primarily due to increases in our service activity. We expect organic service revenue growth in 2025 to benefit from our new and existing Global Digital Solutions offerings and ALM, as well as our traditional services.\n•\nWe expect continued total revenue and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") growth in 2025 as a result of our focus on new product and service offerings, innovation, customer solutions and market expansion in line with our Project Matterhorn objectives.\nOur revenues consist of storage rental revenues and service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value-added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and of revenues associated with our data center operations. Service revenues include charges for related service activities, the most significant of which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, project revenues and courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (2) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the subsequent sale of shredded paper for recycling, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (3) the decommissioning, data erasure, processing and disposition, and recycling or sale of IT hardware and component assets; (4) digital solutions, including the scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records, consulting services and the sale of software as a service; and (5) data center services, including set up, monitoring and support of our customers' assets which are protected in our data center facilities, and special project services, including data center fitout.\nCost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of labor, including wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), data center pass-through power costs, transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, labor and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, IT, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. \n28\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nCost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) and Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 consists of the following:\nCOST OF SALES\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nTrends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by:\n•\nthe total number of facilities we occupy;\n•\nthe mix of properties we own versus properties we lease;\n•\nfluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs;\n•\nthe levels of utilization of these properties; and\n•\ndata center power costs.\nTrends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue are influenced by\n:\n•\nchanges in headcount and compensation levels\n;\n•\nachievement of incentive compensation targets\n;\n•\nworkforce productivity\n;\n and\n•\nvariability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers’ compensation.\nOur depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from depreciation related to storage systems, which include buildings, building and leasehold improvements, data center infrastructure, racking structures and computer systems hardware and software. Amortization relates primarily to customer and supplier relationship intangible assets, Contract Costs (as defined below in \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n) and data center lease-based intangible assets. Both depreciation and amortization are impacted by the timing of acquisitions.\nOur consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to the net effect of foreign currency translation related to our operations outside the United States. It is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on individual balances. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2023 results at the 2024 average exchange rates. Constant currency growth rates are a non-GAAP measure.\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\n29\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nThe following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our United States dollar-reported revenues and expenses:\n \nPERCENTAGE OF \nUNITED STATES DOLLAR-\nREPORTED REVENUE FOR THE\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\nAVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\nPERCENTAGE\n(WEAKENING) / STRENGTHENING OF\nFOREIGN CURRENCY\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAustralian dollar\n2.6 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n$\n0.660 \n$\n0.664 \n(0.6)\n%\nBritish pound sterling\n6.9 \n%\n7.2 \n%\n$\n1.278 \n$\n1.243 \n2.8 \n%\nCanadian dollar\n4.9 \n%\n5.1 \n%\n$\n0.730 \n$\n0.741 \n(1.5)\n%\nEuro\n6.8 \n%\n6.6 \n%\n$\n1.082 \n$\n1.081 \n0.1 \n%\nThe percentage of United States dollar-reported revenues for all other foreign currencies was 13.6% and 14.5% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n30\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization (inclusive of our share of Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated joint ventures), and excluding certain items we do not believe to be indicative of our core operating results, specifically:\nEXCLUDED\n•\nAcquisition and Integration Costs (as defined below)\n•\nRestructuring and other transformation\n•\nLoss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (including real estate)\n•\nOther expense (income), net\n•\nStock-based compensation expense\n•\nIntangible impairments\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues. We also show Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for each of our reportable segments under \"Results of Operations – Segment Analysis\" below.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes both interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), such as operating income, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities. \nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA (IN THOUSANDS):\n \nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n183,666 \n$\n187,263 \nAdd/(Deduct):\nInterest expense, net\n721,559 \n585,932 \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n60,872 \n39,943 \nDepreciation and amortization\n900,905 \n776,159 \nAcquisition and Integration Costs\n(1)\n35,842 \n25,875 \nRestructuring and other transformation\n161,359 \n175,215 \nLoss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (including real estate)\n6,196 \n(12,825)\nOther expense (income), net, excluding our share of losses (gains) from our unconsolidated joint ventures\n(2)\n39,159 \n98,891 \nStock-based compensation expense\n118,138 \n73,799 \nOur share of Adjusted EBITDA reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures\n8,684 \n11,425 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,236,380 \n$\n1,961,677 \n(1)\nRepresent operating expenditures directly associated with the closing and integration activities of our business acquisitions that have closed, or are highly probable of closing, and include (i) advisory, legal and professional fees to complete business acquisitions and (ii) costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations, including move, severance and system integration costs (collectively, \"Acquisition and Integration Costs\").\n(2)\nIncludes foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net, debt extinguishment expense and other, net.

We calculate our FFO measures, including FFO (Nareit), adjusting for our share of reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures. FFO (Nareit) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (Nareit) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (Nareit) is net income (loss).\nWe modify FFO (Nareit), as is common among REITs seeking to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business (\"FFO (Normalized)\"). Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (Nareit) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically:\nEXCLUDED\n•\nAcquisition and Integration Costs\n•\nRestructuring and other transformation\n•\nLoss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (excluding real estate)\n•\nOther expense (income), net\n•\nStock-based compensation expense\n•\nNon-cash amortization related to derivative instruments\n•\nReal estate financing lease depreciation\n•\nTax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items\n•\nIntangible impairments\n•\n(Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO FFO (NAREIT) AND FFO (NORMALIZED) (IN THOUSANDS):\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n183,666 \n$\n187,263 \nAdd/(Deduct):\nReal estate depreciation\n(1)\n367,362 \n322,045 \n(Gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of tax\n(2)\n(6,698)\n(16,656)\nData center lease-based intangible assets amortization\n(3)\n22,304 \n22,322 \nOur share of FFO (Nareit) reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures\n4,830 \n2,226 \nFFO (Nareit)\n571,464 \n517,200 \nAdd/(Deduct):\nAcquisition and Integration Costs\n35,842 \n25,875 \nRestructuring and other transformation\n161,359 \n175,215 \nLoss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (excluding real estate)\n14,025 \n4,307 \nOther expense (income), net, excluding our share of losses (gains) from our unconsolidated joint ventures\n39,159 \n98,891 \nStock-based compensation expense\n118,138 \n73,799 \nNon-cash amortization related to derivative instruments\n16,705 \n21,097 \nReal estate financing lease depreciation\n13,135 \n12,019 \nTax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items\n(4)\n(37,248)\n(35,307)\nOur share of FFO (Normalized) reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures\n(17)\n(374)\nFFO (Normalized)\n$\n932,562 \n$\n892,722 \n(1)\nIncludes depreciation expense related to owned real estate assets (land improvements, buildings, building and leasehold improvements, data center infrastructure and racking structures), excluding depreciation related to real estate financing leases.\n(2)\nTax expense associated with the gain on sale of real estate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $1.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n(3)\nIncludes amortization expense for Data Center In-Place Leases and Data Center Tenant Relationships as defined in Note 2.m. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\n(4)\nRepresents the tax impact of (i) the reconciling items above, which impact our reported net income (loss) before provision (benefit) for income taxes but has an insignificant impact on our reported provision (benefit) for income taxes and (ii) other discrete tax items.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, which provides a summary of our significant accounting policies. Our critical accounting estimates include the following, which are listed in no particular order: \nREVENUE RECOGNITION \nRevenue is recognized when or as control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 2.s. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional details on our revenue recognition policies. Revenue for all our lines of business, with the exception of storage revenues in our Global Data Center Business (which is subject to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 842, \nLeases\n), is recognized in accordance with ASC 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n (\"ASC 606\"), the application of which requires that we make significant judgments related to performance obligations and the transfer of control to the customer.\nWe have determined that the majority of our contracts contain series performance obligations which qualify to be recognized under a practical expedient available in ASC 606 known as the \"right to invoice\". This determination allows variable consideration in such contracts to be allocated to and recognized in the period to which the consideration relates, which is typically the period in which it is billed, rather than requiring estimation of variable consideration at the inception of the contract.\nCertain costs to fulfill or obtain customer contracts and certain initial direct costs of obtaining data center leases, including the costs associated with the initial movement of customer records into physical storage and certain commission expenses, are collectively referred to as \"Contract Costs\". Contract Costs are capitalized and amortized as a component of depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, generally over a three year term, which we have determined is consistent with the transfer of the underlying performance obligations to which the assets relate. Different determinations on term length would result in differences in the amount and timing of amortization expense recognized.\nACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS\nPart of our growth strategy has been to acquire businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition is determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. \nAccounting for acquisitions of a business has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimate the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer and supplier relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily buildings, building and leasehold improvements, data center infrastructure and racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent acquisitions. \nDetermining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. As it relates to our data center acquisitions, the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to (i) certain economic costs (as described more fully in Note 2.m. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) avoided by acquiring a data center operation with active tenants that would have otherwise been incurred if the data center operation was purchased vacant, (ii) market rental rates and (iii) expectations of lease renewals and extensions. Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.\n34\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nOf the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, including data center infrastructure and building improvements, customer and supplier relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. For significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of owned buildings, including data center infrastructure and building improvements, customer and supplier relationship and lease-based intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. For acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of owned buildings, including data center infrastructure and building improvements, and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. When not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer and supplier relationship intangible assets, above and below market in-place operating leases, and racking structures is determined internally. When estimating fair values internally, we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer and supplier relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates. The fair value of above and below market in-place operating leases is determined internally using a discounted cash flow model, utilizing the difference in cash flows between the contractual lease payments over the remaining lease term and estimated market rental rates on comparable assets at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. We determine the fair value of tangible data center assets using an estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition, then discounting for age, economic and functional obsolescence.\nThe fair value of the deferred purchase obligation associated with the ITRenew Transaction (as defined in Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) was determined utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulation model and takes into account our forecasted projections as it relates to the underlying performance of the business. The Monte-Carlo simulation model incorporates assumptions as to expected gross profits over the applicable achievement period, including adjustments for the volatility of timing and amount of the associated revenue and costs, as well as discount rates that account for the risk of the underlying arrangement and overall market risks.\nThe fair value of the deferred purchase obligation associated with the Regency Transaction (as defined in Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) was determined utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulation model and takes into account our forecasted projections as it relates to the underlying performance of the business. The Monte-Carlo simulation model incorporates assumptions as to expected revenue over the achievement period, including adjustments for volatility and timing, as well as discount rates that account for the risk of the arrangement and overall market risks. \nOur estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions. Total supplier relationship intangible assets acquired in our 2024 acquisitions was approximately $131.5 million.\nIMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS \nASSETS SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION \nWe review long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:\n•\nA significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\n•\nA significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;\n•\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;\n•\nAn accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;\n•\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and\n•\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nIf events indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the sum of the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If it is determined that we are unable to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the long-lived assets are written down, on a pro rata basis, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.\nWe did not record impairment charges for any of our long-lived assets or finite-lived intangibles during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\n35\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other than goodwill, we currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. See Note 2.l. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional details on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets policies.\nWe have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We have performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2024 and 2023. We concluded that as of October 1, 2024 and 2023, goodwill was not impaired.\nOur reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2024 were as follows:\n•\nNorth American Records and Information Management reporting unit (\"North America RIM\")\n•\nEurope Records and Information Management reporting unit (\"Europe RIM\")\n•\nLatin America Records and Information Management reporting unit (\"Latin America RIM\")\n•\nAsia, Australia and New Zealand Records and Information Management reporting unit (\"APAC RIM\")\n•\nMedia and Archive Services (formerly Entertainment Services)\n•\nGlobal Data Center\n•\nFine Arts\n•\nALM\nSee Note 2.l. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of our reporting units.\nBased on our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2024, all of our reporting units had estimated fair values exceeding their carrying values by greater than 35%. The ALM reporting unit represented approximately $749.6 million, or 14.7%, of our consolidated goodwill balance at December 31, 2024, and its fair value is most sensitive to changes in our assumptions. The following is a summary of the ALM reporting unit including the goodwill balance (in thousands), the percentage by which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and certain key assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of the reporting unit as of October 1, 2024:\nREPORTING UNIT\nGOODWILL\nBALANCE AT\nOCTOBER 1,\n2024\nPERCENTAGE BY\nWHICH THE FAIR VALUE\nOF THE REPORTING\nUNIT EXCEEDED THE\nREPORTING UNIT\nCARRYING VALUE AS OF\nOCTOBER 1, 2024\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNIT\nMEASUREMENT AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2024\nDISCOUNT\nRATE\nAVERAGE ANNUAL\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nMARGIN USED IN\nDISCOUNTED\nCASH FLOW\nAVERAGE\nANNUAL CAPITAL\nEXPENDITURES AS\nPERCENTAGE OF\nREVENUE\n(1)\nTERMINAL\nGROWTH\nRATE\n(2)\nALM\n$748,000\n57.4%\n15.5%\n15.4%\n1.4%\n3.5%\n(1)\nFor purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis, the term \"capital expenditures\" includes both growth investment and recurring capital expenditures.\n(2)\nTerminal growth rates are applied after year 10 of our discounted cash flow analysis.\nThe fair values of our reporting units are generally determined using a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows (the \"Discounted Cash Flow Model\") and market multiples (the \"Market Approach\"). There are inherent uncertainties and judgments involved when determining the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment testing. The following includes supplemental information to the table above for the ALM reporting unit where the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 57.4% as of October 1, 2024. The fair value of our ALM reporting unit was determined using a Discounted Cash Flow Model approach. We do not use a Market Approach when determining the fair value of our ALM reporting unit given a lack of directly comparable publicly traded guideline companies to ALM. The success of these businesses and the achievement of certain key assumptions developed by management and used in the Discounted Cash Flow Model are contingent upon various factors including, but not limited to, (i) achieving growth from existing customers, (ii) sales to new customers, (iii) increased market penetration and (iv) market pricing trends of IT hardware and component assets.\nALM\nOur ALM business provides hyperscale and corporate IT infrastructure managers with services and solutions that enable the decommissioning, data erasure, processing and disposition, and recycling or sale of IT hardware and component assets. ALM services are enabled by: (i) secure logistics, chain of custody and complete asset traceability practices; (ii) environmentally-responsible asset processing and recycling; and (iii) data sanitization and asset refurbishment services that enable value recovery through asset remarketing. The assumptions we used in determining fair value reflect the ongoing and anticipated expansion of these services, the maintenance and further development of the supplier relationships required to expand this business and meet customer demand and decommissioning schedules of our supplier's IT hardware and component assets, as well as demand for such assets at that time. The assumptions used also reflect market pricing for IT hardware and component assets that is consistent with pricing we observed in the current year.\n36\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS\nKey factors that could reasonably be expected to have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and potentially result in impairment charges include, but are not limited to: (i) a deterioration in general economic conditions, (ii) significant adverse changes in regulatory factors or in the business climate, (iii) adverse actions or assessment by regulators and (iv) changes in market trends due to the evolution of technology, all of which could result in adverse changes to the key assumptions used in valuing the reporting units. The inability to meet the assumptions used in the Discounted Cash Flow Model and Market Approach for each of the reporting units, or future adverse market conditions not currently known, could lead to a fair value that is less than the carrying value in any one of our reporting units. \nThe Discounted Cash Flow Model incorporates significant assumptions including future revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and capital expenditures. The Market Approach requires us to make assumptions related to EBITDA multiples. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions or changes in multiples could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.\nAlthough we believe we have sufficient historical and projected information available to us to test for goodwill impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. Of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions, as changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units. We have assessed the sensitivity of these assumptions on each of our reporting units as of October 1, 2024. \nWe noted that, based on the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units determined as of October 1, 2024:\n•\na hypothetical decrease of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows of these reporting units, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of October 1, 2024 by a range of approximately 9.9% to 12.5% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of our reporting units exceeding their estimated fair value; and\n•\na hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of October 1, 2024 by a range of approximately 3.8% to 14.0% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of our reporting units exceeding their estimated fair value.\nAt December 31, 2024, no factors were identified that would alter the conclusions of our October 1, 2024 goodwill impairment analysis. In making this assessment, we considered a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.\nINCOME TAXES\nAccounting for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change is enacted. Valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not standard as defined in GAAP. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the recoverability of the asset.\nAt December 31, 2024, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $95.5 million and disallowed interest expense carryforwards of $152.2 million, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely, and of which $89.2 million and $68.7 million, respectively, are expected to be realized to reduce future federal taxable income. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $146.6 million and foreign disallowed interest expense carryforwards of $17.7 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to valuation allowances of approximately 72.0% and 46.5%, respectively. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\n37\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had approximately $25.9 million and $23.6 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.\nWe provide for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign TRSs because it is not our intention to reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign TRSs indefinitely outside the United States. As a REIT, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax.\n38\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Amortization relates primarily to customer and supplier relationship intangible assets, Contract Costs and data center lease-based intangible assets. Both depreciation and amortization are impacted by the timing of acquisitions.\nDepreciation expense increased $103.4 million, or 19.7%, on a reported dollar basis for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

The total net proceeds of approximately $1,188.0 million from the issuance, after deducting the initial purchasers' commissions, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nDEBT COVENANTS\nThe Credit Agreement, our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take other specified corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our bond indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement requires that we satisfy a net total lease adjusted leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio on a quarterly basis, and our bond indentures require that, among other things, we satisfy a leverage ratio (not lease adjusted) or a fixed charge coverage ratio (not lease adjusted), as a condition to taking actions such as paying dividends and incurring indebtedness.\n52\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nThe Credit Agreement uses EBITDAR-based calculations and the bond indentures use EBITDA based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance for purposes of calculating leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The EBITDAR- and EBITDA-based leverage calculations include our consolidated subsidiaries, other than those we have designated as \"Unrestricted Subsidiaries\" as defined in the Credit Agreement and bond indentures. Generally, the Credit Agreement and the bond indentures use a trailing four fiscal quarter basis for purposes of the relevant calculations and require certain adjustments and exclusions for purposes of those calculations, which make the calculation of financial performance under the Credit Agreement and bond indentures not directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein. These adjustments can be significant. For example, the calculation of financial performance under the Credit Agreement and certain of our bond indentures includes (subject to specified exceptions and caps) adjustments for non-cash charges and for expected benefits associated with (i) completed acquisitions, (ii) certain executed lease agreements associated with our data center business that have yet to commence and (iii) restructuring and other strategic initiatives. The calculation of financial performance under our other bond indentures includes, for example, adjustments for non-cash charges and for expected benefits associated with (i) completed acquisitions and (ii) events that are extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring.\nOur leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 are as follows:\n \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nMAXIMUM/MINIMUM ALLOWABLE\nNet total lease adjusted leverage ratio\n5.0 \nMaximum allowable of 7.0\nFixed charge coverage ratio\n2.4 \nMinimum allowable of 1.5\nWe are in compliance with our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the Credit Agreement, our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness as of December 31, 2024. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nINTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS\nWe utilize interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our floating rate indebtedness. Certain of our interest rate swap agreements have notional amounts that will increase with the underlying hedged transaction. Under our interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable rate interest payments associated with the notional amount of each interest rate swap, based upon the SOFR, in exchange for the payment of fixed interest rates as specified in the interest rate swap agreements. Our interest rate swap agreements are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, representing the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements, and any changes in fair value are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive items, net. Unrealized gains are recognized as assets, while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. \nIn April 2023, in anticipation of the discontinuance of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") reference rate on June 30, 2023, we terminated interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $350.0 million that were indexed to the one-month LIBOR benchmark rate. The terminated swap agreements had associated unrealized gains at the termination date of approximately $10.1 million. These gains were included in Accumulated other comprehensive items, net and have been reclassified into earnings as reductions to interest expense from the termination date through March 2024, the original maturity date of these interest rate swap agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have approximately $1,482.0 million and $520.0 million, respectively, in notional value outstanding on our interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2024, our interest rate swap agreements have maturity dates ranging from October 2025 through May 2027.\nIRON MOUNTAIN 2024 FORM 10-K\n53\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nCROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS\nWe utilize cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of exchange rate impacts between the United States dollar and certain of our foreign functional currencies, including the Euro and the Canadian dollar. As of December 31, 2024, our cross-currency interest rate swap agreements have maturity dates ranging from August 2025 through November 2026.\nThe notional values of our cross-currency interest rate swaps, by currency, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\n \nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nEuro\n$\n509,187 \n$\n509,187 \nCanadian dollar\n350,000 \n— \n$\n859,187 \n$\n509,187 \nWe have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as hedges of net investments in our Euro and Canadian dollar denominated subsidiaries and they require an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. These cross-currency swap agreements are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, representing the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements, and any changes in fair value are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive items, net. Unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The excluded component of our cross-currency swap agreements is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive items, net and amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis.\nSee Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our derivative instruments. \nACQUISITIONS\nSee Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding our acquisitions.\nREGENCY TECHNOLOGIES\nOn January 3, 2024, in order to expand our ALM business, we acquired 100% of RSR Partners, LLC (doing business as Regency Technologies), an IT asset disposition services provider with operations throughout the United States, for an initial purchase price of approximately $200.0 million, subject to certain working capital adjustments at, and subsequent to, the closing, with $125.0 million paid at closing, funded by borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the remaining $75.0 million (the \"January 2025 Payment\"), paid in January 2025 (the \"Regency Transaction\"). The present value of the January 2025 Payment is included as a component of Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024. The agreement for the Regency Transaction also includes a performance-based contingent consideration with a potential earnout range from zero to $200.0 million based upon achievement of certain three-year cumulative revenue targets, which would be payable in 2027, if earned. The preliminary fair value estimate of this deferred purchase obligation as of the acquisition date was approximately $78.4 million. The fair value of the deferred purchase obligation is included as a component of Other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024. Subsequent increases or decreases in the fair value estimate of the deferred purchase obligation, as well as the accretion of the discount to present value, is included as a component of Other expense (income), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations until the deferred purchase obligation is settled or paid. Subsequent to the acquisition, the results of Regency Technologies are included as a component of Corporate and Other.\nPRIOR YEAR ACQUISITION UPDATE\nOn July 1, 2024, we entered into an agreement with the minority shareholders of Web Werks India Private Limited to acquire the remaining approximately 36.61% interest in the Web Werks JV in two separate transactions. As a result of the agreement, during the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a charge of approximately $29.2 million, which is included as a component of Other expense (income), net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. On July 5, 2024, we completed the acquisition of an approximately 8.55% interest in the Web Werks JV (\"Tranche I\") for approximately 3,000.0 million Indian rupees (or approximately $35.0 million based upon the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Indian rupee on the closing date of Tranche I). Subsequent to the Tranche I payment, our ownership interest in the Web Werks JV is approximately 71.94%. In March 2025, we will be required to make an additional payment of approximately 9,600.0 million Indian rupees (or approximately $112.2 million, based upon the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Indian rupee as of December 31, 2024) to acquire the remaining approximately 28.06% interest in the Web Werks JV (\"Tranche II\"). As part of the Tranche II payment in March 2025, we may also make an incremental payment of approximately 1,000.0 million Indian rupees (or approximately $11.7 million, based upon the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Indian rupee as of December 31, 2024) (the \"Incremental Payment\") if certain infrastructure goals are achieved before December 31, 2024. We are currently assessing the achievement of these goals.
