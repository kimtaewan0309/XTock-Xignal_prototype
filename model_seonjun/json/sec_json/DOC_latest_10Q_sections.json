Our company was originally founded in 1985. We are organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”). We hold substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating subsidiary, Healthpeak OP, a consolidated subsidiary of which we are the managing member. We are a Maryland corporation and qualify as a self-administered REIT. We are headquartered in Denver, Colorado, with additional corporate offices in California, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts and property management offices in several locations throughout the U.S.\nWe have a diversified portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties across three core asset classes of outpatient medical, lab, and continuing care retirement community (“CCRC”) real estate. Under the outpatient medical and lab segments, we own, operate, and develop outpatient medical buildings, hospitals, and lab buildings. Under the CCRC segment, our properties are operated through RIDEA structures. \nWe have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of: (i) an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 19 senior housing assets (our “SWF SH JV”), (ii) loans receivable, and (iii) a preferred equity investment. These non-reportable segments have been p\nresented on a combined basis herein.\nAt September 30, 2025, our portfolio of investments, including properties in certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures, consisted of interests in 703\n \nproperties: (i) Outpatient medical –\n \n530\n \nproperties; (ii) Lab – 139 properties; (iii) CCRC – 15 properties; and (iv) Other non-reportable – 19 properties. The following table summarizes information for our reportable segments for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (dollars in thousands):\nSegment\nAdjusted NOI by Reportable Segment\n(1)\nOutpatient medical\n$\n200,414 \nLab\n138,058 \nCCRC\n36,548 \n_______________________________________\n(1)\nOur Adjusted NOI for our reportable segments, which we also refer to as Total Portfolio Adjusted NOI for our reportable segments, includes results of operations from disposed properties through the disposition date.

See our Segment Analysis below for additional information.\nFor a description of our significant activities during 2025, see “Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Company Highlights” in this report.\n46\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Strategy\nOur strategy is to own, operate, and develop high-quality real estate focused on healthcare discovery and delivery. We manage our real estate portfolio for the long-term to maximize risk-adjusted returns and support the growth of our dividends. Our strategy consists of four core elements:\n(i)\nOur \nreal estate\n: Our portfolio consists of high-quality properties in desirable locations. Our portfolio is focused on outpatient medical and lab buildings, favorable sectors that benefit from the universal desire for improved health. We have built scale and fostered deep industry relationships, two unique factors that provide us with a competitive advantage.\n(ii)\nOur \nfinancials\n: We maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet with ample liquidity as well as long-term fixed-rate debt financing with staggered maturities to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk.\n(iii)\nOur \npartnerships\n: We work with leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, as well as healthcare delivery systems, specialty physician groups, and other healthcare service providers, to meet their real estate needs. We provide high-quality property management services to encourage tenants to renew, expand, and relocate into our properties, which drives increased occupancy, rental rates, and property values.\n(iv)\nOur\n platform\n: We have a people-first culture that we believe attracts, develops, and retains top talent. We continually strive to create and maintain an industry-leading platform, with systems and tools that allow us to effectively and efficiently manage our assets and investment activity.\nMarket Trends and Uncertainties\nOur operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by global and national economic and market conditions generally and by the local economic conditions where our properties are located.\nHigher interest rates and uncertainty in public and private equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and limitations on the availability of capital. In addition, higher interest rates have and could continue to adversely impact our borrowing costs, the fair value of our fixed rate instruments, transaction volume, and real estate values generally, including our real estate. We have also been affected by increased costs relating to tenant improvements and construction, which, together with higher costs of capital and tariff actions (or potential tariff actions), have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, construction starts and the expected yields on our capital projects, including our developments and redevelopments.\nWe continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events on our operations and financial position, and on the operations and financial position of our tenants, operators, and borrowers, to enable us to remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment. These events include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which could negatively impact our business: inflation; recession; interest rates; challenges in the financial markets; availability of private capital and funding in the life science industry; and actions by the U.S. political administration and regulatory agencies that affect healthcare policy, life science research and innovation, labor supply, procurement and construction costs, and general economic conditions (such as budget reconciliation actions, tariff actions, changes in healthcare regulation, decreases in government funding and staffing, and immigration reform).\nTo the extent our tenants and/or operators have experienced, or will experience, increased costs, liquidity constraints, and financing difficulties due to the foregoing macroeconomic and market conditions, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due. \nSee Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 for additional discussion of the risks posed by macroeconomic conditions, as well as the uncertainties we and our tenants, operators, and borrowers may face as a result.\nCompany Highlights\nReal Estate Transactions\n•\nIn February 2025, we acquired: (i) a lab land parcel in Cambridge, Massachusetts for $20 million and (ii) a portfolio of three outpatient medical buildings in New York for $17 million.\n•\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2025, we sold one outpatient medical land parcel for $4 million.\n•\nIn September 2025, we acquired a condominium interest in eight suites within an outpatient medical building in Atlanta, Georgia for $6 million.\n•\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we sold two outpatient medical buildings for $27 million.\n47\nTable of Contents\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Activities\n•\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the following projects were placed in service: (i) a portion of two outpatient medical development projects with total project costs of $32 million, (ii) two lab development buildings held in our unconsolidated Callan Ridge JV of which our share of total project costs was $63 million, (iii) one outpatient medical development project with total project costs of $38 million, (iv) a portion of one lab development project with total project costs of $36 million, (v) two lab redevelopment buildings held in our unconsolidated South San Francisco JVs of which our share of total project costs was $26 million, (vi) one outpatient medical redevelopment project with total project costs of $12 million, and (vii) two lab redevelopment projects with total project costs of $7 million.\nFinancing Activities\n•\nIn February 2025, we repaid $348 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\n•\nIn February 2025, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.38% senior unsecured notes due 2035.\n•\nIn June 2025, we repaid $452 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\n•\nIn August 2025, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2033.\n•\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 5.09 million shares of our common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program (as defined below) at a weighted average price of $18.50 per share for a total of $94 million. \nOther Activities\n•\nIn February 2025, we made a preferred equity investment in a joint venture that holds a lab campus under development in San Diego, California (the “HQ Point Preferred Equity Investment”). This investment is entitled to a preferred return, and we have committed to fund up to a total investment of $50 million. As of September 30, 2025, we have funded $45 million of our total commitment. \n•\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we (i) entered into secured loans with an aggregate principal balance of $120 million, $36 million of which was funded upon closing of the loans, and (ii) entered into and funded one $4 million mezzanine loan to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures.\n•\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we entered into two outpatient medical development joint ventures.\n•\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we received full repayment of: (i) two seller financing loans receivable secured by senior housing assets with an aggregate principal balance of $106 million and (ii) the $15 million outstanding balance of one secured loan.\nDividends\nThe following table summarizes our common stock cash dividends declared in 2025:\nDeclaration Date\nRecord Date\nAmount Per Share\n(1)\nDividend Payment Date\nFebruary 3\nFebruary 14\n$\n0.30500 \nFebruary 26\nApril 4\nApril 18\n0.10167 \nApril 30\nApril 4\nMay 19\n0.10167 \nMay 30\nApril 4\nJune 16\n0.10167 \nJune 27\nJuly 7\nJuly 18\n0.10167 \nJuly 31\nJuly 7\nAugust 18\n0.10167 \nAugust 29\nJuly 7\nSeptember 19\n0.10167 \nSeptember 30\nOctober 6\nOctober 17\n0.10167 \nOctober 30\nOctober 6\nNovember 14\n0.10167 \nNovember 26\nOctober 6\nDecember 19\n0.10167 \nDecember 30\n_______________________________________\n(1)\nOur Board of Directors declares our common stock cash dividends on a quarterly basis. Commencing in April 2025, our Board of Directors transitioned from paying the common stock cash dividend on a quarterly basis to a monthly basis. \n48\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nWe evaluate our business and allocate resources among our operating segments: (i) outpatient medical, (ii) lab, (iii) CCRC, (iv) an interest in our unconsolidated SWF SH JV, (v) loans receivable, and (vi) a preferred equity investment. The Company’s reportable segments, as determined in accordance with ASC 280, \nSegment Reporting\n, are as follows: (i) outpatient medical, (ii) lab, and (iii) CCRC.\n \nUnder the outpatient medical and lab segments, we own, operate, and develop outpatient medical buildings, hospitals, and lab buildings. Our CCRCs are operated through RIDEA structures. \nThe SWF SH JV, loans receivable, and preferred equity investment are\n non-reportable segments that have been presented on a combined basis herein. We evaluate performance based upon property adjusted net operating income (“Adjusted NOI” or “Cash NOI”) in each segment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as updated by Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted NOI\nAdjusted NOI is a non-U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. Adjusted NOI represents real estate revenues (inclusive of rental and related revenues, resident fees and services, and government grant income and exclusive of interest income), less property level operating expenses; Adjusted NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted NOI eliminates the effects of straight-line rents, amortization of market lease intangibles, termination fees, actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense. Adjusted NOI is calculated as Adjusted NOI from consolidated properties, plus our share of Adjusted NOI from unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period), less noncontrolling interests’ share of Adjusted NOI from consolidated joint ventures (calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period). We utilize our share of Adjusted NOI in assessing our performance as we have various joint ventures that contribute to our performance. Our share of Adjusted NOI should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to, our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted NOI is oftentimes referred to as “Cash NOI.” Management believes Adjusted NOI is an important supplemental measure because it provides relevant and useful information by reflecting only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unlevered basis. We use Adjusted NOI to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and to evaluate our Merger-Combined Same-Store (“Merger-Combined SS”) performance, as described below. We believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted NOI. Adjusted NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect various excluded items. Further, our definition of Adjusted NOI may not be comparable to the definitions used by other REITs or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating Adjusted NOI. \nAs described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted NOI. Our operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments for which we disclose Total Portfolio Adjusted NOI for our reportable segments. For further information, including information reconciling our Adjusted NOI for reportable segments to our income (loss) before income taxes and equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOperating expenses generally relate to leased outpatient medical and lab buildings, as well as CCRC facilities. We generally recover all or a portion of our leased outpatient medical and lab property expenses through tenant recoveries, which are recognized within rental and related revenues. \nMerger-Combined Same-Store Adjusted NOI\nMerger-Combined Same-Store Adjusted NOI includes legacy Physicians Realty Trust properties that met the same-store criteria as if they were owned by the Company for the full analysis period. This information allows our investors, analysts, and us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties, excluding properties within the other non-reportable segments. We include properties from our consolidated portfolio, as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures in Adjusted NOI (see Adjusted NOI definition above for further discussion regarding our use of pro-rata share information and its limitations). Merger-Combined Same-Store Adjusted NOI excludes government grant income under the CARES Act, amortization of deferred revenue from tenant-funded improvements, and certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis. \n49\nTable of Contents\nProperties are included in Merger-Combined Same-Store once they are fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented. A property is removed from Merger-Combined Same-Store when it is classified as held for sale, sold, placed into redevelopment, experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations, or a significant tenant relocates from a Merger-Combined Same-Store property to a Merger-Combined non Same-Store property and that change results in a corresponding increase in revenue. We do not report Merger-Combined Same-Store metrics for our other non-reportable segments. \nManagement believes that continued reporting of the same-store portfolio for only pre-merger Healthpeak Properties, Inc. offers minimal value to investors who are seeking to understand the operating performance and growth potential of the Combined Company. The Company was provided access to the underlying financial statements of legacy Physicians Realty Trust and other detailed information about each property, such as the acquisition date. Based on this available information, the Company was able to consistently apply its same-store definition across the combined portfolio. As a result of the Merger, approximately 97%\n \nof the combined portfolio is represented in the Merger-Combined Same-Store presentation for the outpatient medical segment for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nFor a reconciliation of Merger-Combined Same-Store to total portfolio Adjusted NOI and other relevant disclosures by segment, refer to our Segment Analysis below.\nNareit FFO\n.  Funds from Operations (“FFO”), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate or land held for development, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and adjustments to compute our share of Nareit FFO from joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We reflect our share of Nareit FFO for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. For consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100%, we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our Nareit FFO to remove the third-party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. Our pro rata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts, is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period. We do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures, and the pro rata presentations of reconciling items included in Nareit FFO do not represent our legal claim to such items. The joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements, which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital. \nThe presentation of pro rata information has limitations, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses and (ii) other companies in our industry may calculate their pro rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, the pro rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the pro rata financial information as a supplement. \nWe believe Nareit FFO applicable to common shares and diluted Nareit FFO applicable to common shares are important supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term Nareit FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue. \nNareit FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). We compute Nareit FFO in accordance with the current Nareit definition; however, other REITs may report Nareit FFO differently or have a different interpretation of the current Nareit definition from ours. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Nareit FFO and other relevant disclosures, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations” below. \nFFO as Adjusted.\n  In addition, we present Nareit FFO on an adjusted basis before the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, transaction and merger-related items, other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains), restructuring and severance-related charges, prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement or payment of debt, litigation costs (recoveries), casualty-related charges (recoveries), deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and changes in tax legislation (“FFO as Adjusted”). These adjustments are net of tax, when applicable, and are reflective of our share of our joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated \n50\nTable of Contents\njoint ventures. We reflect our share of FFO as Adjusted for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO as Adjusted to remove the third-party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. See “Nareit FFO” above for further disclosures regarding our use of pro rata share information and its limitations. Prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement of debt include the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt. Other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains) include interest income associated with early and partial repayments of loans receivable and other losses or gains associated with non-depreciable assets including goodwill, undeveloped land parcels, and loans receivable. Management believes that FFO as Adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our FFO run-rate and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a REIT. At the same time that Nareit created and defined its FFO measure for the REIT industry, it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community.” We believe stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an FFO run-rate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income (loss), in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the Nareit defined measure of FFO. FFO as Adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts understand this measure used by management. We use FFO as Adjusted to: (i) evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions, (ii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general, and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted FFO measure, and accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO as Adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations” below.\nAdjusted FFO (“AFFO”).  \nAFFO is defined as FFO as Adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) stock-based compensation amortization expense, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts (premiums), (iii) straight-line rents, (iv) deferred income taxes, (v) amortization of above (below) market lease intangibles, net, (vi) non-refundable entrance fees collected in excess of (less than) the related amortization, and (vii) other AFFO adjustments, which include: (a) lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents), (b) actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and (c) amortization of deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. Also, AFFO is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements (“AFFO capital expenditures”). All adjustments are reflective of our pro rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures (reported in “other AFFO adjustments”). We reflect our share of AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our AFFO to remove the third-party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. See “Nareit FFO” above for further disclosures regarding our use of pro rata share information and its limitations. We believe AFFO is an alternative run-rate performance measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods, and (iii) results among REITs more meaningful. AFFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities: (i) adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, (ii) transaction-related costs, (iii) litigation settlement expenses, and (iv) restructuring and severance-related charges. Furthermore, AFFO is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures, which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO, and accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Management believes AFFO provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a REIT, and by presenting AFFO, we are assisting these parties in their evaluation. AFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to AFFO and other relevant disclosures, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations” below.\n51\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nOverview\nThe following table summarizes results for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\n(1)\n (in thousands):\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet income (loss) applicable to common shares\n$\n(117,256)\n$\n85,675 \n$\n(202,931)\nNareit FFO\n318,155 \n311,247 \n6,908 \nFFO as Adjusted\n318,750 \n316,205 \n2,545 \nAFFO\n291,974 \n295,979 \n(4,005)\n_______________________________________\n(1)\nFor the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations” below.\nNet income (loss) applicable to common shares decreased\n \nprimarily as a result of the following:\n•\nother-than-temporary impairment charges on two lab unconsolidated joint ventures in 2025;\n•\na decrease in gain on sales of real estate related to fewer real estate dispositions in 2025; \n•\na decrease in Adjusted NOI generated from our outpatient medical and lab segments related to: (i) dispositions of real estate in 2024 and 2025 and (ii) assets placed into development and redevelopment in 2024 and 2025, partially offset by: (i) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2024 and 2025 and (ii) new leasing activity during 2024 and 2025 (including the impact to straight-line rents); and\n•\nan increase in interest expense related to: (i) the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.38% senior unsecured notes due 2035, which closed in February 2025, (ii) the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2033, which closed in August 2025, and (iii) higher borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nThe\n \ndecrease in net income (loss) applicable to common shares was partially offset by:\n•\na decrease in depreciation related to dispositions of real estate in 2024 and 2025;\n•\na decrease in transaction and merger-related costs incurred in connection with the Merger;\n•\na decrease in general and administrative expenses due to: (i) lower compensation expense and (ii) merger-related synergies; \n•\nan increase in income tax benefit related to the other-than-temporary impairment charge on the Needham Land Parcel JV;\n•\nan increase in Adjusted NOI generated from our CCRC segment related to: (i) increased rates for resident fees and (ii) higher occupancy; and\n•\nan increase in interest income related to: (i) secured loans funded in 2024 and 2025 and (ii) seller financing provided in connection with the disposition of two outpatient medical buildings in November 2024, partially offset by principal repayments on loans receivable in 2024 and 2025.\nNareit FFO\n \nincreased\n \nprimarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss) applicable to common shares, except for the following, which are excluded from Nareit FFO:\n•\nother-than-temporary impairment charges; \n•\ngain on sales of real estate; and \n•\ndepreciation and amortization expense.\nFFO as Adjusted increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting Nareit FFO, except for transaction and merger-related items, which are excluded from FFO as Adjusted.\nAFFO decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting FFO as Adjusted, except for the impact of straight-line rents, which are excluded from AFFO, and higher AFFO capital expenditures during the period.

Interest income and other further increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as a result of (i) seller financing provided in connection with the disposition of 59 outpatient medical buildings in July 2024 and (ii) mezzanine and secured loans receivable acquired as part of the Merger. \nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of: (i) the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.38% senior unsecured notes due 2035, which closed in February 2025, (ii) the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2033, which closed in August 2025, and (iii) higher borrowings under the commercial paper program, partially offset by: (i) the repayment of $348 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior unsecured notes in February 2025 and (ii) the repayment of $452 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes in June 2025. Interest expense further increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as a result of: (i) debt assumed as part of the Merger, including $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Term Loan, and $128 million aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt and (ii) borrowings under the 2029 Term Loan, which closed in March 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of dispositions of real estate in 2024 and 2025, partially offset by development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2024 and 2025. Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of assets acquired as part of the Merger.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of (i) lower compensation expense and (ii) merger-related synergies.\nTransaction and merger-related costs\nTransaction and merger-related costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of costs of combining operations with Physicians Realty Trust that were incurred in 2024. The decrease in transaction and merger-related costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was partially offset by costs incurred in 2025 related to investments we are no longer pursuing.\n61\nTable of Contents\nImpairments and loan loss reserves (recoveries), net\nImpairments and loan loss reserves (recoveries), net decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as a result of a decrease in loan loss reserves under the current expected credit losses model, which is primarily due to (i) reserves recognized in 2024 on loans receivable acquired as part of the Merger, (ii) changes in operating performance and fair values of the underlying collateral of the Company’s loans receivable, and (iii) recoveries related to loans repaid during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, partially offset by new and extended loans during 2024 and 2025.\nGain (loss) on sales of real estate, net\nGain on sales of real estate, net decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as a result of (i) no dispositions of real estate during the three months ended March 31, 2025, (ii) the $3 million gain on sale of one outpatient medical land parcel which was sold during the three months ended June 30, 2025, and (iii) the $12 million gain on sales of\n \ntwo outpatient medical buildings which were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to (i) the $3 million gain on sales of two outpatient medical buildings which were sold during the three months ended March 31, 2024, (ii) the $122 million gain on sales of a portfolio of seven lab buildings and 11 outpatient medical buildings which were sold during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and (iii) the $60 million gain on sales of a portfolio of 59 outpatient medical buildings which were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dispositions of real estate and the associated gain (loss) on sales recognized.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of a gain upon change of control related to the sale of a 65% interest in two lab buildings in San Diego, California to a third-party in January 2024, partially offset by casualty-related losses recognized in 2025.\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nIncome tax benefit increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of the income tax benefit from the other-than-temporary impairment charge on the Needham Land Parcel JV, as discussed below, partially offset by an increase in operating income associated with our CCRCs. Income tax expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of: (i) the income tax expense incurred in connection with the sale of a 65% interest in two lab buildings in San Diego, California to a third-party in January 2024, (ii) the tax benefit from casualty-related losses recognized in 2025, and (iii) the aforementioned impacts to the income tax benefit from the other-than-temporary impairment charge affecting the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nEquity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures\nEquity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of other-than-temporary impairment charges on two lab unconsolidated joint ventures, the South San Francisco JVs and the Needham Land Parcel JV, partially offset by the preferred return on the HQ Point Preferred Equity Investment.\nNoncontrolling interests’ share in earnings\nNoncontrolling interests’ share in earnings increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily as a result of increased income from consolidated joint ventures acquired as part of the Merger.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe anticipate that our cash flows from operations, available cash balances, and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future for purposes of: (i) funding recurring operating expenses; (ii) meeting debt service requirements; and (iii) satisfying funding of distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members. Distributions are made using a combination of cash flows from operations, funds available under our bank line of credit (the “Revolving Facility”) and commercial paper program, proceeds from the sale of properties, and other sources of cash available to us.\nIn addition to funding the activities above, our principal liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:\n•\nfund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs;\n•\nfund future acquisition, transactional, and development and redevelopment activities; and\n•\nfund loans receivable and other investment commitments. \nOur longer term liquidity needs include the items listed above as well as meeting debt service requirements.\n62\nTable of Contents\nWe anticipate satisfying these future needs using one or more of the following:\n•\ncash flows from operations;\n•\nsale of, or exchange of ownership interests in, properties or other investments;\n•\nborrowings under our Revolving Facility and commercial paper program;\n•\nissuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt; and/or\n•\nissuance of common or preferred stock or its equivalent, including sales of common stock under the ATM Program (as defined below).\nOur ability to access the capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Changes in general market and economic conditions as well as credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital. Our 2029 Term Loan, our two senior unsecured delayed draw term loans with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “2027 Term Loans”), our 2028 Term Loan, and our Revolving Facility accrue interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a margin that depends on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt. We also pay a facility fee on the entire commitment under our Revolving Facility that depends upon our credit ratings. As of October 22, 2025, we had long-term credit ratings of Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from S&P Global, and short-term credit ratings of P-2 from Moody’s and A-2 from S&P Global.\nA downgrade in credit ratings by Moody’s or S&P Global may have a negative impact on (i) the interest rates of our Revolving Facility, 2027 Term Loans, 2028 Term Loan, and 2029 Term Loan, (ii) facility fees for our Revolving Facility, and (iii) the pricing of notes issued under our commercial paper program and senior unsecured notes. While a downgrade in our credit ratings would adversely impact our cost of borrowing, we believe we would continue to have access to the unsecured debt markets, and we could also seek to enter into one or more secured debt financings, issue additional securities, including under our ATM Program, or dispose of certain assets to fund future operating costs, capital expenditures, or acquisitions, although no assurances can be made in this regard. Refer to “Market Trends and Uncertainties” above for a more comprehensive discussion of the potential impact of economic and market conditions on our business.\nChanges in Material Cash Requirements and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDebt.\n  Our material cash requirements related to debt increased by $416 million\n \nto $9.1 billion at September 30, 2025, when compared to December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of:\n \n(i) the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.38% senior unsecured notes due 2035, (ii) the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2033, and (iii) a $218 million increase in notes outstanding under our commercial paper program, partially offset by the repayment upon maturity of: (i) $452 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes and (ii) $348 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior unsecured notes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our debt commitments.\nDevelopment and redevelopment commitments\n.  Our material cash requirements related to development and redevelopment projects and Company-owned tenant improvements decreased by $28 million to $256 million at September 30, 2025, when compared to December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of construction spend on projects in development and redevelopment, partially offset by commitments on projects placed into development and redevelopment during the period.\nConstruction loan commitments.\n  Our material cash requirements to provide additional principal on loans for redevelopment and capital expenditure projects increased\n \nby $36 million to $121 million at September 30, 2025, when compared to December 31, 2024. This increase\n \nwas the result of outstanding commitments on secured loans executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, partially offset by a reduction in remaining commitments due to loan fundings and repayments during the nine months then ended. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther investment commitments.  \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we funded $45 million\n \nof our $50 million HQ Point Preferred Equity Investment. At September 30, 2025, our remaining funding commitment related to the HQ Point Preferred Equity Investment was\n \n$5 million, which is expected to be funded in 2025. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, as of September 30, 2025, we had aggregate investments of\n \n$3 million\n \nin funds that make venture capital investments in various early-stage technology solutions (“Other Equity Investments”). At September 30, 2025, our remaining funding commitment related to the Other Equity Investments was $9 million, which is expected to be funded over the next four\n \nyears. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n63\nTable of Contents\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests.\n  Our material cash requirements related to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n \nincreased\n \nby\n \n$25 million\n \nto\n \n$28 million\n \nat September 30, 2025, when compared to December 31, 2024. The values of these redeemable noncontrolling interests are subject to change based on the assessment of redemption value at each redemption date. As of September 30, 2025, the estimated redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests that have met the conditions for redemption is $15 million. The estimated redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests that\n \nwill meet the conditions for redemption upon completion of each of the related development projects is\n \n$13 million. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDistribution and Dividend Requirements.\n  Our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we meet the dividend requirements of the Code, relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities. Under the Code, REITs may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. In February 2025, our Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly common stock cash dividend, from $0.300 to $0.305 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend of $1.220 per share. Commencing in April 2025, our Board of Directors also transitioned to a practice of paying the quarterly common stock cash dividend on a monthly basis, which are declared quarterly. Our future common stock cash dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the Board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition. There have been no other changes to our distribution and dividend requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n.  We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Four\n \nof these joint ventures have aggregate mortgage debt of $871 million, of which our share is $200 million. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the applicable joint venture. Additionally, as of September 30, 2025, we had 16 outstanding letter of credit obligations totaling $16 million.\nThere have been no other material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 to the material cash requirements or material off-balance sheet arrangements disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 under “Material Cash Requirements” and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.\nThe following table sets forth changes in cash flows (in thousands):\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n957,875 \n$\n786,966 \n$\n170,909 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n(629,053)\n119,975 \n(749,028)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n(353,395)\n(833,919)\n480,524 \nOperating Cash Flows\nOur cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants’ performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors. Our net cash provided by operating activities increased $171 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of: (i) a decrease in merger-related costs, (ii) an increase in Adjusted NOI from properties acquired as part of the Merger and acquisitions of real estate in 2025, (iii) developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2024 and 2025, (iv) annual rent increases, and (v) new leasing and renewal activity. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by: (i) an increase in cash paid for interest and (ii) a decrease in Adjusted NOI from dispositions of real estate in 2024 and 2025.\n64\nTable of Contents\nInvesting Cash Flows\nOur cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments of real estate, net of proceeds received from sales of real estate and repayments on loans receivable. Our net cash used in investing activities increased $749 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of the following: (i) a decrease in proceeds from sales of real estate, (ii) an increase in cash used for development and redevelopment of real estate, (iii) proceeds received from the Callan Ridge JV transaction in 2024, (iv) an increase in cash used for real estate asset acquisitions, (v) lower net repayments on loans receivable, and (vi) an increase in cash used for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the Merger in 2024.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nOur cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by issuances and/or repurchases of equity, borrowings and repayments under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt, net of dividends paid to common shareholders. Our net cash used in financing activities decreased $481 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of the following: (i) higher net issuances under the commercial paper program, (ii) an increase in proceeds received from the issuances of senior unsecured notes, (iii) lower repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase programs, (iv) lower distributions to noncontrolling interests, and (v) higher contributions from noncontrolling interests. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: (i) an increase in cash used to repay senior unsecured notes that reached maturity in 2025, (ii) a decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of term loans, and (iii) an increase in dividends paid on common stock.\nDebt\nIn February 2025, we repaid $348 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior unsecured notes at maturity. Also in February 2025, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.38% senior unsecured notes due 2035. In June 2025, we repaid $452 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes at maturity. In August 2025, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2033.\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding debt.\nApproximately 95%\n \nand 99%\n \nof our consolidated debt was fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. At September 30, 2025, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average effective interest rates of\n \n4.20% and 4.79%, respectively. At September 30, 2024, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average effective interest rates of 4.05% and 7.41%, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, we had the following swapped to fixed rates through interest rate swap instruments: (i) the $750 million 2029 Term Loan, (ii) the $500 million 2027 Term Loans, (iii) the $400 million 2028 Term Loan, and (iv) $142 million of variable rate mortgage debt. These interest rate swap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. For purposes of classification of the amounts above, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as fixed rate debt due to us having effectively established a fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Item 3 below.\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nHealthpeak OP is the issuer of senior unsecured notes that were offered and sold on a registered basis under the Securities Act as described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The obligations of Healthpeak OP to pay principal, premiums, if any, and interest on such senior unsecured notes are guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Company, DOC DR Holdco, and DOC DR OP Sub. Additionally, DOC DR OP Sub is the issuer, as successor to the Physicians Partnership upon the Merger, of the senior unsecured notes issued by the Physicians Partnership prior to, and assumed by Healthpeak as part of, the Merger as described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The obligations of DOC DR OP Sub to pay principal, premiums, if any, and interest on such senior unsecured notes are guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Company, Healthpeak OP, and DOC DR Holdco. \nSubsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the parent guarantee is “full and unconditional”, the subsidiary obligor is a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company, the guaranteed security is debt or debt-like, and consolidated financial statements of the parent company have been filed. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of Healthpeak OP, DOC DR Holdco, and DOC DR OP Sub have not been presented.\n65\nTable of Contents\nAs permitted under Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Company, Healthpeak OP, DOC DR Holdco, and DOC DR OP because the Company, Healthpeak OP, DOC DR Holdco, and DOC DR OP have no material assets, liabilities, or operations other than the debt financing activities described in the first paragraph of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and their investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.\nEquity\nAt September 30, 2025, we had 695 million shares of common stock outstanding, equity totaled\n \n$8.2 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $13.6 billion.\nAt-The-Market Program\nIn February 2023, we terminated our previous at-the-market equity offering program and established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that allows for the sale of shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.5 billion. In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an “ATM forward contract”) with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under our ATM Program. The ATM Program was most recently amended in February 2025 to add certain banks as sales agents, a forward seller, and a forward purchaser under the ATM Program.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we did not\n issue any shares of our common stock under any ATM program.\nAt September 30, 2025, $1.5 billion of our common stock remained available for sale under the ATM Program. Actual future sales of our common stock will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, and our capital needs. We have no obligation to sell any shares under our ATM Program.\nSee Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our ATM Program.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nHealthpeak OP\n.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, certain of our employees (“OP Unitholders”) were issued approximately 2 million\n \nnoncontrolling, non-managing member units in Healthpeak OP (“OP Units”). When certain conditions are met, the OP Unitholders have the right to require redemption of part or all of their OP Units for cash or shares of our common stock, at our option as managing member of Healthpeak OP. The per unit redemption amount is equal to either one share of our common stock or cash equal to the fair value of a share of common stock at the time of redemption. We classify the OP Units in permanent equity because we may elect, in our sole discretion, to issue shares of our common stock to OP Unitholders who choose to redeem their OP Units rather than using cash. As of September 30, 2025, there were approximately 4 million\n \nOP Units outstanding, and\n \n265 thousand\n \nhad met the criteria for redemption.\nDownREITs.\n  At September 30, 2025, non-managing members held an aggregate of approximately 11 million\n \nunits in eight limited liability companies for which we hold controlling interests and/or are the managing member. The DownREIT units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock. At September 30, 2025, the outstanding DownREIT units were convertible into approximately 13 million shares of our common stock. \n66\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn July 24, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”) to supersede and replace our previous program. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, we may acquire shares of our common stock in the open market or other similar purchase techniques (including in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act or pursuant to one or more plans adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act), up to an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. Purchases of common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program may be exercised at our discretion with the timing and number of shares repurchased depending on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program expires in July 2026 and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, there were no repurchases of common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 5.09 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $18.50 per share for a total of $94 million. At September 30, 2025, $406 million of the Company’s common stock remained available for repurchase under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program.\nShelf Registration\nOn February 8, 2024, the Company and Healthpeak OP jointly filed a prospectus with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S-3, using an automatic shelf registration process. This shelf registration statement expires on February 8, 2027 and at or prior to such time, we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. On February 5, 2025, the Company and Healthpeak OP jointly filed a post-effective amendment to the shelf registration statement to add certain subsidiaries of the Company as co-registrants and register their guarantees of the debt securities of the Company and/or Healthpeak OP as additional securities that may be offered under the prospectus included in the shelf registration statement. Under the “shelf” process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings. The securities described in the prospectus include future offerings of: (i) the Company’s common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, debt securities, and guarantees by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries of debt securities issued by Healthpeak OP, and (ii) Healthpeak OP’s debt securities and guarantees by Healthpeak OP and certain other subsidiaries of the Company of debt securities issued by the Company.\n67\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations\nThe following is a reconciliation from net income (loss) applicable to common shares, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Nareit FFO, FFO as Adjusted, and AFFO (in thousands):\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income (loss) applicable to common shares\n$\n(117,256)\n$\n85,675 \n$\n(43,335)\n$\n237,985 \nReal estate related depreciation and amortization\n262,317 \n280,019 \n796,779 \n782,736 \nHealthpeak’s share of real estate related depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures \n12,574 \n12,127 \n37,304 \n32,520 \nNoncontrolling interests’ share of real estate related depreciation and amortization\n(3,807)\n(4,534)\n(12,686)\n(13,705)\nLoss (gain) on sales of depreciable real estate, net\n(11,500)\n(62,325)\n(13,136)\n(187,624)\nLoss (gain) upon change of control, net\n(1)\n— \n430 \n— \n(77,548)\nTaxes associated with real estate dispositions\n(2)\n— \n(145)\n(335)\n11,512 \nImpairments (recoveries) of real estate, net\n(3)\n175,827 \n— \n175,827 \n— \nNareit FFO applicable to common shares\n318,155 \n311,247 \n940,418 \n785,876 \nDistributions on dilutive convertible units and other\n4,551 \n4,577 \n13,735 \n11,670 \nDiluted Nareit FFO applicable to common shares\n$\n322,706 \n$\n315,824 \n$\n954,153 \n$\n797,546 \nImpact of adjustments to Nareit FFO:\n \n \nTransaction and merger-related items\n(4)\n$\n2,420 \n$\n2,725 \n$\n18,169 \n$\n108,923 \nOther impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains), net\n(5)\n(54)\n441 \n125 \n11,741 \nCasualty-related charges (recoveries), net\n(6)\n(1,771)\n1,792 \n6,375 \n588 \nTotal adjustments\n$\n595 \n$\n4,958 \n$\n24,669 \n$\n121,252 \nFFO as Adjusted applicable to common shares\n$\n318,750 \n$\n316,205 \n$\n965,087 \n$\n907,128 \nDistributions on dilutive convertible units and other\n4,551 \n4,571 \n13,715 \n11,537 \nDiluted FFO as Adjusted applicable to common shares\n$\n323,301 \n$\n320,776 \n$\n978,802 \n$\n918,665 \nFFO as Adjusted applicable to common shares\n$\n318,750 \n$\n316,205 \n$\n965,087 \n$\n907,128 \nStock-based compensation amortization expense\n4,046 \n3,755 \n10,410 \n11,935 \nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts (premiums)\n7,981 \n7,408 \n23,708 \n19,247 \nStraight-line rents\n(14,282)\n(10,346)\n(30,836)\n(32,891)\nAFFO capital expenditures\n(27,261)\n(23,510)\n(76,125)\n(76,744)\nCCRC entrance fees\n(7)\n12,711 \n11,046 \n36,449 \n30,548 \nDeferred income taxes\n(179)\n585 \n4,989 \n2,330 \nAmortization of above (below) market lease intangibles, net\n(8,105)\n(7,887)\n(28,402)\n(23,325)\nOther AFFO adjustments\n(1,687)\n(1,277)\n(1,303)\n(4,947)\nAFFO applicable to common shares\n291,974 \n295,979 \n903,977 \n833,281 \nDistributions on dilutive convertible units and other\n4,550 \n4,576 \n13,735 \n11,671 \nDiluted AFFO applicable to common shares\n(7)\n$\n296,524 \n$\n300,555 \n$\n917,712 \n$\n844,952 \nRefer to footnotes on the next page.\n68\nTable of Contents\n_______________________________________\n(1)\nThe nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a gain upon change of control related to the sale of a 65% interest in two lab buildings in San Diego, California. The gain upon change of control is included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(2)\nThe nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes non-cash income tax expense related to the sale of a 65% interest in two lab buildings in San Diego, California.\n(3)\nThe three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes other-than-temporary impairment charges on certain unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we concluded that the decline in fair values of these joint ventures was other-than-temporary due to the length of time and extent of which the fair values have been less than carrying value. Other-than-temporary impairment charges on our unconsolidated joint ventures are recognized in equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(4)\nThe three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 include costs related to the Merger, which are primarily comprised of advisory, legal, accounting, tax, information technology, post-combination severance and stock compensation expense, and other costs of combining operations with Physicians Realty Trust that were incurred during the period. The nine months ended September 30, 2025 also includes $6 million of costs incurred related to certain investments we are no longer pursuing. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were partially offset by termination fee income of $4 million and $13 million, respectively, associated with Graphite Bio, Inc., which later merged with LENZ Therapeutics, Inc. in March 2024, for which the lease terms were modified to accelerate expiration of the lease to December 2024. This termination fee income is included in rental and related revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but is excluded from FFO as Adjusted.\n(5)\nThe three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 include reserves and (recoveries) for expected loan losses recognized in impairments and loan loss reserves (recoveries), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(6)\nCasualty-related charges (recoveries), net are recognized in other income (expense), net, equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, and noncontrolling interests' share in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(7)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we changed our definition of AFFO to adjust for the non-refundable entrance fees collected in excess of (less than) the related amortization as we believe the cash collection of these fees is a more meaningful representation of the performance of the CCRC reportable segment in the determination of AFFO. Diluted AFFO applicable to common shares utilizing the prior definition for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $283.8 million and $289.5 million, respectively. Diluted AFFO applicable to common shares utilizing the prior definition for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $881.3 million and $814.4 million, respectively. \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A discussion of accounting estimates that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we added additional considerations to our critical accounting estimate as described below:\nImpairment of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOn a quarterly basis, we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment. If an equity method investment shows indicators of impairment, we compare the fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline in fair value below carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. In our evaluation, we consider various factors, including the performance of each investment, our investment strategy, and market conditions, including the impact to market rents, capitalization rates, and supply and demand for rentable space. \nThe fair values of our equity method investments are determined based on discounted cash flows which are subjective and consider assumptions regarding forecasted occupancy, market rents, capitalization rates, discount rates, expected capital expenditures, and land values. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n69\nTable of Contents"
