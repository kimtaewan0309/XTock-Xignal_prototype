In its effort to achieve best-cost manufacturing, AMETEK has operating facilities, as of December 31, 2024, in China, Czechia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Serbia. These facilities offer proximity to customers and provide opportunities for increasing international sales. Acquisitions also have allowed AMETEK to achieve operating synergies by consolidating operations, product lines and distribution channels, benefiting both of AMETEK’s operating groups.\nExperienced Management Team\n.    Another component of AMETEK’s success is the strength of its management team and that team’s commitment to improving Company performance. AMETEK senior management has extensive industry experience and an average of approximately 23 years of AMETEK service. The management team is focused on delivering strong, consistent and profitable growth, growing \n2\nTable of Contents\nshareholder value, and creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. Individual performance is tied to financial results through Company-established stock ownership guidelines and equity incentive programs.\nBusiness Strategy \nAMETEK is committed to achieving earnings growth through the successful implementation of the AMETEK Growth Model. The goal of the Growth Model is high single digit annual percentage growth in sales and double digit annual percentage growth in earnings per share over the business cycle, strong cash flow generation, and a superior return on total capital. Other financial initiatives have been or may be undertaken, including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain foreign countries and share repurchases. \nAMETEK’s Growth Model integrates the four growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global and Market Expansion, and New Product Development with a focus on cash generation and capital deployment. \nOperational Excellence.    \nOperational Excellence is AMETEK’s cornerstone strategy for accelerating growth, improving profit margins and strengthening its competitive position across its businesses. Operational Excellence focuses on initiatives to drive increased organic sales growth, improvements in operating   efficiencies and sustainable practices. It emphasizes team building and a participative management culture. AMETEK’s Operational Excellence strategies include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, Design for Six Sigma, Value Engineering/Value Analysis, growth kaizens, and digitalization. Each plays an important role in improving efficiency, enhancing the pace and quality of innovation and driving profitable sales growth. Operational Excellence initiatives have yielded lower operating and administrative costs, shortened manufacturing cycle times, resulted in higher cash flow from operations and increased customer satisfaction. They also have played a key role in achieving synergies with newly acquired companies.\nStrategic Acquisitions\n.    Acquisitions are a key to achieving the goals of the AMETEK Growth Model. Since the beginning of 2020 through December 31, 2024, AMETEK has completed 14 acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately $1.4 billion. AMETEK targets companies that offer a compelling strategic, technical and cultural fit. It seeks to acquire businesses in adjacent markets with complementary products and technologies. It also looks for businesses that provide attractive growth opportunities aligned with strong secular growth themes, often in new and emerging markets. AMETEK’s management team has developed considerable skill in identifying, acquiring and integrating new businesses. As it has executed its acquisition strategy, AMETEK’s mix of businesses has shifted toward those that are more highly differentiated and, therefore, offer better opportunities for growth and profitability.\nGlobal & Market Expansion\n.    AMETEK has experienced significant growth outside the United States, reflecting an expanding international customer base, investments in its global infrastructure and the attractive growth potential of its businesses in overseas markets. While Europe remains its largest overseas market, AMETEK has pursued growth opportunities worldwide, especially in key emerging markets. It has grown sales in Latin America and Asia by driving its global and market expansion strategy and initiatives. AMETEK also has expanded its sales, service, and engineering capabilities globally. Recently acquired businesses have further added to AMETEK’s international presence. \nNew Product Development\n.    New products are essential to AMETEK’s long-term growth. As a result, AMETEK has maintained a consistent investment in new product development and engineering. AMETEK's businesses help solve our customers' most complex challenges with differentiated technology solutions. In 2024, AMETEK added to its highly differentiated product portfolio with a range of new products across many of its businesses. \nAMETEK focuses on cash generation and capital deployment.  AMETEK generates strong cash flow given its asset-light business model and strong operational execution. This cash flow supports AMETEK’s capital \n3\nTable of Contents\ndeployment strategy with its primary focus on strategic, value-enhancing acquisitions. AMETEK is also committed to paying a consistently increasing cash dividend.\nAttracting, retaining, and developing talent is critical to the success and sustainability of the AMETEK Growth Model as our employees are responsible for successfully driving these strategies.\n2024 Overview\nOperating Performance\nIn 2024, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow.

A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2024.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the year ended December 31, 2023 \nNet sales for 2024 were $6,941.2 million, an increase of $344.2 million or 5.2%, compared with net sales of $6,597.0 million in 2023. The increase in net sales for 2024 was due to a 7% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 2% organic sales decline. EIG net sales were $4,659.9 million in 2024, an increase of 0.8%, compared with $4,624.3 million in 2023. EMG net sales were $2,281.3 million in 2024, an increase of 15.6%, compared with $1,972.7 million in 2023. \nTotal international sales for 2024 were $3,291.7 million or 47.4% of net sales, an increase of $163.5 million or 5.2%, compared with international sales of $3,128.2 million or 47.4% of net sales in 2023. The increase in international sales was primarily driven by strong demand in Europe and Asia, as well as contributions from the 2023 acquisitions. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $1,880.8 million in 2024, an increase of $148.4 million or 8.6%, compared with $1,732.4 million in 2023. \nOrders for 2024 were $6,810.3 million, a decrease of $102.1 million or 1.5% compared with $6,912.4 million in 2023.  The decrease in orders was due to a 2% organic order decrease, a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 2% increase from acquisitions. The organic orders decrease is due to customer inventory normalization in our automation and engineered solutions core businesses. The Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2024 was $3,403.2 million, a decrease of $130.9 million or 3.7%, compared with $3,534.1 million at December 31, 2023. \nSegment operating income for 2024 was $1,884.9 million, an increase of $77.4 million or 4.3%, compared with segment operating income of $1,807.5 million in 2023.

Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. Below are the policies used in preparing \n27\nTable of Contents\nthe Company's financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. A complete list of the Company’s significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n•\nBusiness Combinations. \nThe Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. Third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the absence of a third party appraisal, the Company uses internal valuation estimates based on pertinent data from comparable prior acquisitions\n.  \nEstimating fair values requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: discount rates, future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names, technology, and customer relationships. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\n•\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. \nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs either a qualitative or quantitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units.  The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and performed a quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year. The Company may elect to perform a qualitative analysis in future periods.\nThe Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based on the Company’s long-range plan and are considered level 3 inputs. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market\nconditions, the Company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained\nunchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value\ncalculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The\n2024 results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that,\ndespite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units still\nexceeded their respective carrying values by 95% to 388%.\nThe impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets. The Company elected to bypass the performing the qualitative screen. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs, which is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using an appropriate discount rate.  Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Certain impairment models have discount rates calculated based on a debt/equity cost of capital.  While the Company uses the \n28\nTable of Contents\nbest available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded intangible balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.\nThe Company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2024, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $7,579.2 million or 51.8% of the Company’s total assets. The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2024 and determined that the carrying values of the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.\n•\nIncome Taxes. \nThe process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Company’s tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.\nThe Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Company’s forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Company’s deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.\nThe Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nForward-Looking Information \nCertain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Company’s actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Company’s actual \n29\nTable of Contents\nresults to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.",
