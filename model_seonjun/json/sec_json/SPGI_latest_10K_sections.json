The increase at Ratings was driven by growth in both transaction revenue and non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue. The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to subscription revenue growth for work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products. Revenue growth at Commodity Insights was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products. The increase at Indices was primarily due to higher asset-linked fees revenue, higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue and higher data subscription revenue. The increase at Mobility was primarily due to new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business. Revenue at Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the divestitures of Fincentric and the PrimeOne business in August of 2024 and November of 2024, respectively. Revenue at Commodity Insights was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. Revenue at Mobility was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023.

Excluding the impact of a gain on dispositions in 2024 compared to a loss on dispositions, net in 2023 of 7 percentage points, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 5 percentage points, a net acquisition-related benefit in 2024 compared to acquisition-related costs in 2023 of 4 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 3 percentage points, higher disposition-related costs in 2023 of 1 percentage point and higher lease impairments in 2023 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of 2 percentage points and legal settlement costs in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 21%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and investments in strategic initiatives, and higher technology costs. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\n34\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \n2023\nRevenue increased 12% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit; subscription revenue growth for Desktop products, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect®, and data feed products within Data & Advisory Solutions at Market Intelligence; growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue due to higher refinancing activity and higher non-transaction revenue due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our Crisil subsidiary at Ratings; continued demand for market data and market insights products, higher conference revenue and an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data and price assessments to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights; price increases and new business growth within the Dealer business as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023 at Mobility; and higher exchange-traded derivative revenue and higher data subscription revenue at Indices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023, a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue at Ratings and lower over-the-counter derivatives revenue at Indices.

Subscription revenue increased in 2024 primarily due to growth in work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business at Mobility, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue. Asset linked fees increased at Indices primarily due to higher levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds and higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices and the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to increased volumes. Revenue at Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the divestitures of Fincentric and the PrimeOne business in August of 2024 and November of 2024, respectively. Revenue at Commodity Insights was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. Revenue at Mobility was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023.

This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.\n2023\nRevenue increased 12% as compared to 2022. Subscription revenue increased in 2023 primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Subscription revenue growth in Desktop products, Credit & Risk Solutions and Data & Advisory Solutions at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and higher data subscription revenue at Indices, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue due to higher refinancing activity at Ratings and an increase in conference revenue at Commodity Insights, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our Crisil subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Asset linked fees remained relatively unchanged at Indices due to higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs, offset by product mix. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was primarily driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices and an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit and fixed income new issuance volumes.

The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and higher technology costs. See “Segment Review” below for further information.\nCorporate Unallocated Expense\n \n—\n Corporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses.

This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency.\n2023\nSegment Operating Profit —\n Segment operating profit decreased 24% as compared to 2022.

Excluding the impact of higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 15 percentage points, a S&P Foundation grant in 2022 of 7 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by a loss on disposition in 2023 of 4 percentage points, Corporate Unallocated expense increased 69% primarily due to increased incentives.\nEquity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\n— The Company holds an investment in a 50/50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combined each of the company’s post-trade services into a new joint venture, OSTTRA.

Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily includes the net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans. Other income, net for 2024 was $25 million, other expense, net in 2023 was $15 million and other income, net for 2022 was $70 million. During 2023 and 2022, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.S. retirement plan and U.K. plan, respectively, triggering the recognition of a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $23 million and $13 million, respectively. Excluding amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of $6 million and pre-tax settlement charges in 2023 and 2022, other income, net was $31 million, $9 million, and $83 million for 2024, 2023, 2022, respectively. The increase in other income, net in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net periodic benefit cost in 2024 and gains on our mark-to-market investments in 2024 compared to losses in 2023. The decrease in other income, net in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to losses on our mark-to-market investments in 2023 compared to gains in 2022.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $37 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a benefit from our net investment hedge program, reduced expense related to commercial paper borrowings in 2024 and higher interest income from invested cash. Interest expense, net increased $30 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the issuance of $750 million 5.25% senior notes in September of 2023 and incremental expense related to commercial paper borrowings. See Note 5 - \nDebt\n to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net\nIn 2022, we recognized an \n$8 million\n loss on extinguishment of debt which includes a tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer of $142 million, partially offset by a $134 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt. \nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 21.5%, 21.2% and 25.1% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fluctuation in tax rates by year is primarily due to tax charge on merger related divestitures and change in mix of income by jurisdiction. \n44\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.\nSegment Review\nMarket Intelligence\nMarket Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.

Revenue growth was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the divestitures of Fincentric and the PrimeOne business in August of 2024 and November of 2024, respectively. An increase in recurring variable revenue due to increased volumes also contributed to revenue growth.

Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nMarket Intelligence continues to focus on developing key product offerings in growth areas such as energy transition and sustainability and growing new products and product features by leveraging technology investments. Product launches and innovation continued at Market Intelligence in 2024 with the introduction of several new products and product features leveraging technology investments. \nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nThe market for data, analytical capabilities and research services is intensely competitive, ranging from established firms to fast evolving market disruptors. Market Intelligence competes domestically and internationally based on a number of factors, including the quality and range of its data, analytical capabilities, research services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, and technological innovation.\nMarket Intelligence is subject to global regulation, particularly in the European Union, the U.K., the U.S. and increasingly so in other jurisdictions.  Several laws and regulations in the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S. have been adopted but not yet implemented, or have been proposed or are being considered, to which Market Intelligence, or its clients, will or may become subject, including laws and regulations related to pricing providers, sustainability, credit rating data, data privacy and cyber security and technology and organizational resilience.  For example, the EU passed the Digital Operational Resilience Act in December 2022 (“DORA”), which became effective January 17, 2025. DORA imposes operational resilience and cyber security standards and obligations, including technical and organizational standards and responsibilities which require technology and/or organizational investment, upon (i) many Market Intelligence financial market clients, who aim to pass such obligations onto vendors like Market Intelligence, and (ii) information and communications technology providers designated by the EU as “Critical Third Party Providers,” which in certain instances includes Market Intelligence.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has published a consultation on establishing a UK Operational Resilience Framework, which if adopted may impact our Market Intelligence financial market clients who may look to pass such obligations onto vendors like Market Intelligence.  In addition, from time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nAt this time, the exact impact on Market Intelligence of any such recently adopted or proposed laws or regulations, or market studies, remains uncertain, but they could increase the regulatory exposure of Market Intelligence and are anticipated to increase the costs and legal risks relating to certain of Market Intelligence’s activities. Furthermore such laws and regulations may adversely affect the ability of Market Intelligence to provide its products and services, or result in changes in the demand for its products and services. If Market Intelligence fails to comply with any such laws or regulations, it could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines. Regulatory developments may also present commercial opportunities to Market Intelligence to develop further or different services to enable better compliance by its clients.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Market Intelligence business, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Market Intelligence business, see Note 13 – \nCommitments and Contingencies\n to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, \nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRatings \nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.\n48\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nRatings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:\n•\nratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and\n•\nbank loan ratings.\nNon-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at Crisil. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $162 million, $154 million\n an\nd $143 million, respectively.\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n(in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nRevenue\n$\n4,370 \n$\n3,332 \n$\n3,050 \n31 \n%\n9 \n%\nTransaction revenue \n$\n2,326 \n$\n1,425 \n$\n1,241 \n63 \n%\n15 \n%\nNon-transaction revenue \n$\n2,044 \n$\n1,907 \n$\n1,809 \n7 \n%\n5 \n%\n% of total revenue:\nTransaction revenue\n53 \n%\n43 \n%\n41 \n%\nNon-transaction revenue\n47 \n%\n57 \n%\n59 \n%\nU.S. revenue\n$\n2,500 \n$\n1,824 \n$\n1,652 \n37 \n%\n10 \n%\nInternational revenue\n$\n1,870 \n$\n1,508 \n$\n1,398 \n24 \n%\n8 \n%\n% of total revenue:\n     U.S. revenue\n57 \n%\n55 \n%\n54 \n%\n     International revenue\n43 \n%\n45 \n%\n46 \n%\nOperating profit \n1\n$\n2,707 \n$\n1,864 \n$\n1,672 \n45 \n%\n11 \n%\n% Operating margin\n62 \n%\n56 \n%\n55 \n%\n1\n2024 includes legal settlement costs of $20 million, a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment of $6 million and employee severance charges of $5 million. \n2023 \nincludes employee severance charges of $10 million and an asset impairment of $1 million.\n 2022 includes \nemployee severance charges of $24 million, legal costs of $5 million and an asset write-off of $1 million.\n 2024, 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $14 million, $8 million and $7 million, respectively.\n2024\nRevenue increased 31%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. An increase in structured finance revenue driven by increased collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.\n \nOperating profit increased 45%. Excluding the impact of legal settlement costs in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 46% due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\n2023\nRevenue increased 9%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue primarily driven by increased high-yield and investment-grade issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. An increase in bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased \n49\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nissuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our Crisil subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.\nOperating profit increased 11%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance costs in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10% due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher current-year compensation costs and prior-year write-downs in incentive compensation as result of financial performance.\nBilled Issuance Volumes\nWe monitor billed issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Billed issuance excludes items that do not impact transaction revenue, such as issuance from frequent issuer programs, unrated debt, and most international public finance to more effectively correlate issuance activity to movements in transaction revenue.\nThe following table provides billed issuance levels based on Ratings’ internal data feeds for the years ended December 31:\n(in billions)\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nInvestment-grade billed issuance *\n$\n1,497 \n$\n1,102 \n$\n1,038 \n36%\n6%\nHigh-yield billed issuance *\n$\n501 \n$\n258 \n$\n163 \n94%\n59%\nOther billed issuance **\n$\n1,914 \n$\n1,179 \n$\n1,137 \n62%\n4%\nTotal billed issuance\n$\n3,911 \n$\n2,539 \n$\n2,338 \n54%\n9%\nNote - Totals presented may not sum due to rounding.\n*     \nIncludes Corporates, Financial Services and Infrastructure.\n** \n \nIncludes Bank Loans, Structured Finance and Government.\nBilled issuance was up in 2024 as continued favorable market conditions drove issuers to capitalize on tightening borrowing spreads. Refinancing continued to drive high-yield, while M&A and other non-refinancing activity also drove billed issuance increases in investment grade and bank loans. Structured finance billed issuance increases were driven primarily by new CLO issuance.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nRevenue increased in 2024 primarily driven by an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue, bank loan ratings revenue and an increase in non-transaction revenue. Increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity drove increases in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue. An increase in structured finance revenue driven by increased CLO issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth. \nEnergy transition and sustainability initiatives and international expansion in emerging markets continue to be areas of focus for Ratings. \nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nGeneral\nRatings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets in which it operates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are from time to time considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including, for example, provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings or to increase competition among credit rating agencies, provisions regarding remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. Similarly, other laws, regulations \n50\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nand rules are being adopted or considered or are likely to be considered in the future that may impact ancillary and other services provided by Ratings in addition to its credit rating products and services, for example regulatory oversight regimes for ESG ratings providers such as the EU regulation on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities that was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in November 2024 (the \"EU ESG Ratings Regulation\").  The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Ratings’ activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for our products and services.\nIn the normal course of business both in the U.S. and abroad, Ratings (or the legal entities comprising Ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies). Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of Ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into Ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries (including market studies) could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties, activity restrictions or negative impacts on our cash flow, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.\nU.S.\nThe businesses conducted by our Ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd Frank Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which our Ratings segment conducts business. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S.\nS&P Global Ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). The SEC first began informally designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SEC’s Net Capital Rule. The Reform Act created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as NRSROs. Under the Reform Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Reform Act, the Dodd Frank Act and the Exchange Act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&P Global Ratings’ Form NRSRO are available on S&P Global Ratings’ website.\nEuropean Union\nIn the European Union (\"EU\"), the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009, the European Parliament passed a regulation (“CRA1”) that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the EU, which became effective in 2010. CRA1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Ratings was granted registration in October of 2011. In January of 2011, the EU established the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the EU.\nAdditional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these rules, among other things:\n•\nimpose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;\n•\nrequire member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;\n•\nimpose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;\n•\nimpose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and\n•\nimpose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.\nSince January 2025, Ratings has been subject in the EU to new operational resilience and cyber security standards under the Digital Operational Resilience Act, including technical and organizational standards and responsibilities which may require technology and/or organizational investment.\nThe EU ESG Ratings Regulation will start applying mid-2026 and could impose new regulatory requirements regarding some of Ratings' ancillary and other services.\n51\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the EU.\n \nUnited Kingdom\nFollowing its exit from the European Union, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) established a credit rating agencies oversight regime with rules that closely mirror those in place in the EU. Ratings was granted registration with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) on January 1, 2021. It is possible that the rules applicable to credit rating agencies in the U.K. will diverge from those in the EU in the future as a result of changes to one or the other legislative regime or differing approaches by the FCA and ESMA.\nOther Jurisdictions\nOutside of the U.S., the EU and the U.K., regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. Ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. Regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future.\n \nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Ratings business, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Commodity Insights provides essential price data, analytics, industry insights and software & services, enabling the commodity and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency.\nOn May 14, 2024, we completed the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders, a globally-recognized portfolio of hydrogen-related conferences and events, digital training and market intelligence. The acquisition is part of our Commodity Insight’s segment and complements Commodity Insights global conference business and provides customers with full coverage of the hydrogen and derivative value chain alongside Energy Transition and Sustainability solutions, including hydrogen price assessments, emission factors and market research. The acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders is not material to our consolidated financial statements. \nCommodity Insights includes the following business lines:\n•\nEnergy & Resources Data & Insights — includes data, news, insights, and analytics for petroleum, gas, power & renewables, petrochemicals, metals & steel, agriculture, and other commodities;\n•\nPrice Assessments — includes price assessments and benchmarks, and forward curves;\n•\nUpstream Data & Insights — includes exploration & production data and insights, software and analytics; and\n•\nAdvisory & Transactional Services — includes consulting services, conferences, events and global trading services.\nCommodity Insights’ revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue \n—\n primarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products and software term licenses;\n•\nSales usage-based royalties \n—\n primarily from licensing our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges; and \n•\nNon-subscription revenue \n—\n conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, events, and perpetual software licenses.\nSee Note 2 - \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion including information on the merger with IHS Markit.\n52\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n(in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nRevenue\n$\n2,142 \n$\n1,946 \n$\n1,685 \n10 \n%\n16 \n%\nSubscription revenue \n$\n1,873 \n$\n1,707 \n$\n1,492 \n10 \n%\n14 \n%\nSales usage-based royalties\n$\n103 \n$\n81 \n$\n67 \n27 \n%\n21 \n%\nNon-subscription revenue\n \n$\n166 \n$\n158 \n$\n126 \n5 \n%\n25 \n%\n% of total revenue:\n     Subscription revenue\n87 \n%\n88 \n%\n89 \n%\n     Sales usage-based royalties\n5 \n%\n4 \n%\n4 \n%\n     Non-subscription revenue\n8 \n%\n8 \n%\n7 \n%\nU.S. revenue\n$\n835 \n$\n773 \n$\n673 \n8 \n%\n15 \n%\nInternational revenue\n$\n1,307 \n$\n1,173 \n$\n1,012 \n11 \n%\n16 \n%\n% of total revenue:\n     U.S. revenue\n39 \n%\n40 \n%\n40 \n%\n     International revenue \n61 \n%\n60 \n%\n60 \n%\nOperating profit \n1\n$\n845 \n$\n704 \n$\n591 \n20 \n%\n19 \n%\n% Operating margin\n39 \n%\n36 \n%\n35 \n%\n1\n2024 include\ns IHS Markit merger costs of $14 million, employee severance charges of $13 million, asset write-offs of $1 million and disposition-related costs of $1 million. 2023 \ninclude\ns IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million, employee severance charges of $26 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. \n2022 \n inc\nludes \nemployee severance charges of $45 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $26 million\n. 2024, 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $130 million, $131 million and $111 million, respectively.\n2024\nRevenue increased 10% primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges due to increased trading volumes for Platts based contracts  across all commodity sectors and higher consulting revenue also contributed to revenue growth. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. All four business lines contributed to revenue growth in 2024 with the Price Assessments, Energy & Resources Data & Insights and Advisory & Transactional Services businesses being the most significant drivers, followed by the Upstream Data & Insights business. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 20%. Excluding the impact of higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 5 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 3 percentage points, operating profit increased 12%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, higher incentives, investment in strategic initiatives and expenses associated with the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\n53\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \n2023\nRevenue increased 16% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts and higher conference revenue. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes also contributed to revenue growth. The Energy & Resources Data & Insights, Price Assessments and Upstream Data & Insights businesses continue to be the most significant revenue streams, followed by the Advisory & Transactional Services business. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 19%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 6 percentage points and higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 3 percentage points, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 16%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs, increased incentives, an increase in costs related to the Commodity Insights conferences in 2023 and an increase in strategic investments. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nIn 2024, sustained demand for market data and market insights products, an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes, higher consulting revenue and the favorable impact of the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024 contributed to revenue growth. Commodity Insights continues to focus on developing new products and product features leveraging technology investments and developing key product offerings in energy transition and sustainability.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nCommodity Insights' price assessment business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny.  Commodity Insights is subject to commodity benchmark regulation in the EU (the “EU Benchmark Regulation”) and the U.K. (the \"U.K. Benchmark Regulation\"), as well as increasing regulation in other jurisdictions. Commodity Insights has obtained authorization and is now supervised by the \nDutch Authority for the Financial Markets\n in the Netherlands under the EU Benchmark Regulation, and it will likely need to take similar steps in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom when the transitional period under the EU Benchmark Regulation (and its equivalent under the U.K. Benchmark Regulation) ends, as well as in jurisdictions outside of Europe implementing similar legislation.\nThe EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively \"MiFID II\") have applied in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research and direct  how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm’s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). MiFID II and potential subsequent amendments may result in changes to the manner in which the Commodity Insights business licenses its price assessments. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation may impose additional regulatory burdens on Commodity Insights activities in the EU over time, but their impact on, and costs to, the Company have not yet been substantive.\nIn October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Commodity Insights has aligned its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.\nFrom time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nOther laws, regulations and rules are being adopted or considered or are likely to be considered in the future that may impact Commodity Insights, for example regulatory oversight regimes for ESG ratings providers such as the EU regulation on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities that was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in November 2024 (the \"EU ESG Ratings Regulation\").  The EU ESG Ratings Regulation will start applying mid-2026 and could impose new regulatory requirements regarding some of Commodity Insights’ ancillary and other services. The impact on us of the adoption \n54\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nof any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Commodity Insights’ activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for our products and services.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Commodity Insights business, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(“Market Scan”), a leading provider of automotive pricing and incentive intelligence, including Automotive Payments as a Service\nTM\n and its powerful payment calculation engine. The addition of Market Scan to Mobility enabled the integration of detailed transaction intelligence in areas that are complementary to existing services for dealers, OEMs, lenders, and other market participants. The acquisition of Market Scan is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nMobility includes the following business lines:\n•\nDealer \n—\n includes analytics to predict future buyers, targeted marketing, and vehicle history data to allow people to shop, buy, service and sell used cars;\n•\nManufacturing \n—\n includes insights, forecasts and advisory services spanning the entire automotive value chain, from product planning to marketing, sales and the aftermarket; and\n•\nFinancial  \n—\n includes reports and data feeds to support lenders and insurance companies\n.\nMobility’s revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue \n—\n Mobility’s core information products provide critical information and insights to all global OEMs, most of the world’s leading suppliers, and the majority of North American dealerships. Mobility operates across both the new and used car markets. Mobility provides data and insight on future vehicles sales and production, including detailed forecasts on technology and vehicle components; supplies car makers and dealers with market reporting products, predictive analytics and marketing automation software; and supports dealers with vehicle history reports, used car listings and service retention services. Mobility also sells a range of services to financial institutions, to support their marketing, insurance underwriting and claims management activities; and\n•\nNon-subscription revenue \n— \nOne-time transactional sales of data that are non-cyclical in nature – and that are usually tied to underlying business metrics such as OEM marketing spend or safety recall activity – as well as consulting and advisory services.\nThe Mobility business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and financial results are included since the date of acquisition.\n55\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n(in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nRevenue\n$\n1,609 \n$\n1,484 \n$\n1,142 \n8 \n%\n30 \n%\nSubscription revenue \n$\n1,299 \n$\n1,169 \n$\n888 \n11 \n%\n32 \n%\nNon-subscription revenue\n \n$\n310 \n$\n315 \n$\n254 \n(2)\n%\n24 \n%\n% of total revenue:\n     Subscription revenue\n81 \n%\n79 \n%\n78 \n%\n     Non-subscription revenue\n19 \n%\n21 \n%\n22 \n%\nU.S. revenue\n$\n1,325 \n$\n1,223 \n$\n932 \n8 \n%\n31 \n%\nInternational revenue\n$\n284 \n$\n261 \n$\n210 \n9 \n%\n24 \n%\n% of total revenue:\n     U.S. revenue\n82 \n%\n82 \n%\n82 \n%\n     International revenue \n18 \n%\n18 \n%\n18 \n%\nOperating profit \n1\n$\n312 \n$\n260 \n$\n213 \n20 \n%\n22 \n%\n% Operating margin\n19 \n%\n18 \n%\n19 \n%\n1\n     2024 includes employee severance charges of $7 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million, acquisition-related costs of $2 million and a liability write-off of $1 million. 2023 includes employee severance charges of $9 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2022 includes an acquisition-related benefit of $14 million, employee severance charges of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million. 2024, 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $303 million, $301 million and $241 million, respectively.\n2024\nRevenue increased 8% primarily due to growth within the Dealer and Financial businesses driven by continued new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in non-subscription revenue in the Manufacturing business due to lower recall activity and marketing services. Revenue at Mobility was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023.   Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 20%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 19 percentage points, a liability write-off in 2024 of 4 percentage points and higher acquisition-related costs in 2023 of 4 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles in 2024 of 8 percentage points and higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2024 of 8 percentage points, operating profit increased 9% driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, higher incentives, an increase in strategic investments and expenses associated with the acquisition of Market Scan. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.\n2023\nRevenue increased 30% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, price increases and new business growth within the Dealer business as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023. Increases within the Financial business due to strong underwriting volumes and the Manufacturing business due to strong recall activity and uptick in marketing solutions also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 22%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 5 percentage points, an acquisition-related benefit in 2022 of 1 percentage point and higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 29% driven by revenue growth, partially offset by the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs, increased incentives, higher technology costs and expenses associated with the acquisition of Market Scan. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points.\n56\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nIn 2024, Mobility delivered revenue growth within the Dealer and Financial businesses. The Manufacturing business was unfavorably impacted by lower non-subscription revenue primarily due to weakness in recall activity. \nMobility continues to focus on multiple growth opportunities including: evolving our forecasting business to encompass new technologies and new forms of mobility; the transformation to hybrid electric vehicles and digital retail; enabling consumers to shop, buy, service and sell used cars; and, leveraging the power of S&P Global to develop products for financial markets and the industry’s transition towards sustainable mobility. \nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nCertain types of information that our Mobility business collects, compiles, stores, uses, transfers, publishes and/or sells is subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates. There is an increasing public concern regarding, and resulting regulations of, privacy, data, and consumer protection issues. Certain laws and regulations to which our Mobility business is subject pertain to personally identifiable information relating to individuals. Such laws and regulations constrain the collection, use, storage, and transfer of personally identifiable information, and impose other obligations with which we must comply. Other regulation geared at consumer protection such as the Federal Trade Commission's CARS Rule announced in December 2023 sets a framework to ensure transparency throughout the vehicle buying and leasing process and could therefore impact Mobility's products and services. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation and civil or criminal penalties (including monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines) in one or more jurisdictions and reputational damage resulting in the loss of data, brand equity and business. To conduct our operations, our Mobility business also moves data across national borders and consequently can be subject to a variety of evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security in an increasing number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, such as the U.S. Driver's Privacy Protection Act (\"DPPA\"), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the cyber-security law adopted by China in 2017, the separate consumer privacy laws in California and other states in the U.S., as well as other jurisdictions considering imposing such restrictions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which our Mobility business operates, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. It is possible that our Mobility business could be prohibited or constrained from collecting or disseminating certain types of data or from providing certain products or services. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues or in the case of a DPPA violation, U.S. courts may award liquidated damages of $2,500 per individual's personal information. Additional risks are presented by the evolving landscape related to sanctions and export control laws. The landscape related to these laws is evolving rapidly and presents compliance challenges to all businesses covered by these laws. In addition, from time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Mobility business, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Mobility business, see Note 13\n – \nCommitments and Contingencies\n to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, \nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndices\nIndices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products, and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.\nIndices derives revenue from asset-linked fees when investors direct funds into its proprietary designed or owned indexes, sales usage-based royalties of its indices, as well as data subscription arrangements. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:\n•\nInvestment vehicles \n—\n asset-linked fees such as ETFs and mutual funds, that are based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices’ benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;\n57\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \n•\nExchange traded derivatives \n—\n generate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;\n•\nIndex-related licensing fees \n—\n fixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and\n•\nData and customized index subscription fees \n—\n fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $52 million ($43 million after-tax) for the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in (Gain) loss on dispositions, net in the consolidated statements of income. \nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n(in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nRevenue\n$\n1,628 \n$\n1,403 \n$\n1,339 \n16%\n5%\nAsset-linked fees\n$\n1,046 \n$\n859 \n$\n862 \n22%\n—%\nSubscription revenue\n$\n292 \n$\n277 \n$\n258 \n6%\n7%\nSales usage-based royalties\n$\n290 \n$\n267 \n$\n219 \n9%\n22%\n% of total revenue:\n     Asset-linked fees\n64 \n%\n61 \n%\n65 \n%\n     Subscription revenue\n18 \n%\n20 \n%\n19 \n%\n     Sales usage-based royalties\n18 \n%\n19 \n%\n16 \n%\nU.S. revenue\n$\n1,322 \n$\n1,147 \n$\n1,088 \n15%\n5%\nInternational revenue\n$\n306 \n$\n256 \n$\n251 \n20%\n2%\n% of total revenue:\n     U.S. revenue\n81 \n%\n82 \n%\n81 \n%\n     International revenue\n19 \n%\n18 \n%\n19 \n%\nOperating profit\n \n1\n$\n1,103 \n$\n925 \n$\n927 \n19%\n—%\nLess: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n$\n284 \n$\n241 \n$\n249 \n18%\n(3)%\nNet operating profit\n$\n819 \n$\n684 \n$\n678 \n20%\n1%\n% Operating margin\n68 \n%\n66 \n%\n69 \n%\n% Net operating margin\n50 \n%\n49 \n%\n51 \n%\n1\n2024 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million, a loss on disposition of $1 million and employee severance charges of $1 million. 2023 includes employee severance charges of $5 million, a gain on disposition of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million. 2022 i\nncludes \na gain on disposition of $52 million, employee severance charges of $14 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $2 million\n.\n 2024, 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $36 million, $36 million and $31 million, respectively.\n \n2024\nRevenue at Indices increased 16% primarily due to an increase in asset linked fees revenue driven by higher levels of assets under management (“AUM”) for ETFs and mutual funds, higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in trading volume and higher data subscription revenue. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 33% to $3.836 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 33% to $4.389 trillion compared to 2023. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 19%. Excluding the impact of a loss on disposition in 2024 compared to a gain on disposition in 2023 of 4 percentage points, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 3 percentage points, operating profit increased 18% due to revenue growth partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, \n58\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nhigher incentives and an increase in strategic investments. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.\n2023\nRevenue at Indices increased 5% primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in average trading volume and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower over-the-counter derivatives revenue. Asset linked fees remained relatively unchanged at Indices due to higher average levels of AUM for ETFs, offset by product mix. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 8% to $2.895 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 27% to $3.303 trillion compared to 2022. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit remained unchanged, decreasing less than 1%. Excluding the impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 5 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by  higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 5% due to revenue growth partially offset by increased compensation costs and incentives. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. \nIndustry Highlights and Outlook \nRevenue increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase in asset linked fees revenue driven by higher levels of AUM for ETFs and mutual funds, higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in trading volume and higher data subscription revenue. Indices continues to be a leading index provider for the ETF market space. \nKey strategic growth areas, including thematic and factor indices and energy transition and sustainability, continue to be areas of focus for Indices and contributed to revenue growth in 2024. \nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nThe financial benchmarks industry is subject to specific benchmark regulation in the European Union (the \"EU Benchmark Regulation\"), the United Kingdom (the \"U.K. Benchmark Regulation\"), and Australia (the \"Australia Benchmark Regulation\"). Various other jurisdictions, including the United States, India, Canada and South Africa, are also considering the regulation of financial benchmarks through new or existing regimes.\nAlthough they vary in scope, the requirements of the EU Benchmark Regulation, the U.K. Benchmark Regulation and the Australian Benchmark Regulation are similar. Indices currently maintains a benchmark administrator in both the Netherlands (authorized by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM)) for its benchmark activities in the European Union and in the United Kingdom (authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority) for its\n \nbenchmark activities in the United Kingdom. The Australian Benchmark Regulation requires a license from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (“ASIC”), which Indices has obtained. These benchmark regulations have and may continue to cause increased operating obligations, exposure, compliance risk, and costs of doing business for Indices.\nIn July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (the “Financial Benchmark Principles”), intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmarks. The Financial Benchmark Principles address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles.\nFrom time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Indices business, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

See Note 2 - \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the sale of Engineering Solutions and the merger with IHS Markit.\nEngineering Solutions included our Product Design offerings that provided technical professionals with the information and insight required to more effectively design products, optimize engineering projects and outcomes, solve technical problems and address complex supply chain issues. Our offerings utilized advanced knowledge discovery technologies, research tools, and software-based engineering decision engines to advance innovation, maximize productivity, improve quality and reduce risk. \nEngineering Solutions’ revenue was generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue \n— \nprimarily from subscriptions to our Product Design offerings providing standards, codes and specifications; applied technical reference; engineering journals, reports, best practices, and other vetted technical reference; and patents and patent applications, which includes Engineering Workbench; Goldfire’s cognitive search and other advanced knowledge discovery capabilities that help pinpoint answers buried in enterprise systems and unstructured data enabling engineers and technical professionals to accelerate problem solving; and\n•\nNon-subscription revenue \n— \nprimarily from retail transaction and consulting services.\n \nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31: \n(in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nRevenue\n$\n— \n$\n133 \n$\n323 \nN/M\n(59)\n%\nSubscription revenue \n$\n— \n$\n125 \n$\n300 \nN/M\n(58)\n%\nNon-subscription revenue\n \n$\n— \n$\n8 \n$\n23 \nN/M\n(67)\n%\n% of total revenue:\n     Subscription revenue\n— \n%\n94 \n%\n93 \n%\n     Non-subscription revenue\n— \n%\n6 \n%\n7 \n%\nU.S. revenue\n$\n— \n$\n72 \n$\n179 \nN/M\n(60)\n%\nInternational revenue\n$\n— \n$\n61 \n$\n144 \nN/M\n(57)\n%\n% of total revenue:\n     U.S. revenue\n— \n%\n54 \n%\n55 \n%\n     International revenue \n— \n%\n46 \n%\n45 \n%\nOperating profit \n1\n$\n— \n$\n19 \n$\n15 \nN/M\n24 \n%\n% Operating margin\n— \n%\n14 \n%\n5 \n%\nN/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\n2023 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $1 million. 2022 includes employee severance charges of $4 million and amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $35 million.\n \n2023 \n \nRevenue decreased 59% as a result of the sale of Engineering Solutions.

Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2022 of 77 percentage points and employee severance charges in 2022 of 10 percentage points, operating profit decreased 63% as a result of the sale of Engineering Solutions. As of May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions and the results are included through that date. The Engineering Solutions business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and the financial results are included since the date of acquisition through May 2, 2023.\n60\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \nWe continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. In 2025, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs in the short term and into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.\nCash Flow Overview\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by (used for):\nOperating activities\n$\n5,689 \n$\n3,710 \n$\n2,603 \nInvesting activities\n(255)\n562 \n3,628 \nFinancing activities\n(4,998)\n(4,280)\n(11,326)\nIn 2024, free cash flow increased to $5.3 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2023 primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.\nOperating activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $5.7 billion in 2024 as compared to $3.7 billion in 2023. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2024, proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in 2024 and higher tax payments in 2023.\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $3.7 billion in 2023 as compared to $2.6 billion in 2022. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2023, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022, higher taxes paid on divestitures in 2022 and a grant payment to the S&P Global Foundation in 2022.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.\nInvesting activities\nOur cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.\nCash used for investing activities was $0.3 billion for 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $0.6 billion for 2023, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received in 2023 related to the disposition of Engineering Solutions.\nCash provided by investing activities was $0.6 billion for 2023 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received from dispositions in 2022 related to the dispositions of CUSIP Global Services, Oil Price Information Services, the Leveraged Commentary and Data business and a related family of leveraged loan indices, and the Base Chemicals business. \nRefer to Note 2 – \nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nto the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n61\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nFinancing activities\nOur cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt.\nCash used for financing activities increased to $5.0 billion in 2024 from $4.3 billion in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the $750 million issuance of senior note in 2023.\nCash used for financing activities decreased to $4.3 billion in 2023 from $11.3 billion in 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2023. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we received a total of 6.7 million shares, including 0.2 million shares received in February of 2024 related to our November 13, 2023 accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received a total of 8.6 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in February of 2023 related to our December 2, 2022 ASR agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased 33.5 million shares for $12.0 billion of cash. See Note 9 \n— Equity\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our ASR agreements.\nOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2020 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. As of December 31, 2024, 12.0 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 Repurchase Program was completed.\nAdditional Financing\n \nOn December 17, 2024, we entered into a revolving $2.0 billion \nfive-year\n credit agreement that will terminate on December 17, 2029 (our “credit facility”). This credit facility replaced our revolving $2.0 billion five-year credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on April 26, 2026 (our “previous credit facility”). The previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective. There were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced. \nWe have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2024  and 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper. \nCommitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 7 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.\nThe only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.\nDividends\nOn January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.96 per share. \nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nThe senior notes described below were issued by S&P Global Inc. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. \n•\nOn August 22, 2024, S&P Global Inc. issued $746 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2033 that have been registered with the SEC and guaranteed by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC in exchange for unregistered senior notes of like principal amounts and terms that were originally issued on September 12, 2023.\n•\nOn March 1, 2023, S&P Global Inc. issued new senior notes that have been registered with the SEC and guaranteed by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC in exchange for the following series of unregistered senior notes of like \n62\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nprincipal amount and terms:\n•\n$700 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2028 that were originally issued on March 2, 2022;\n•\n$921 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2029 that were originally issued on March 2, 2022;\n•\n$1,237 million of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2027 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022;\n•\n$1,227 million of 2.70% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2029 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022;\n•\n$1,492 million of 2.90% Senior Notes due 2032 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022;\n•\n$974 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2052 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022; and\n•\n$500 million of 3.90% Senior Notes due 2062 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022.\n•\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $600 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2030 and $700 million of 2.3% senior notes due in 2060. \n•\nOn November 26, 2019, we issued $500 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2029 and $600 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2049.\n•\nOn May 17, 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.5% senior notes due in 2048.\n•\nOn September 22, 2016, we issued $500 million of 2.95% senior notes due in 2027. \n•\nOn November 2, 2007 we issued $400 million of 6.55% Senior Notes due 2037.\n \n \nThe notes above are unsecured and unsubordinated and rank equally and ratably with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have recorded $4.2 billion for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership discussed in Note 9 – \nEquity\n to our consolidated financial statements.  Specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, whereby, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (“CGIS”) has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. We have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make.\nWe make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. During 2024, we contributed $11 million to our retirement plans. Expected employer contributions in 2025 are $11 million and $2 million for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In 2025, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7 – \nEmployee Benefits\n to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n64\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. \nWe believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.\nThe presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\n(in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n5,689 \n$\n3,710 \n$\n2,603 \n53%\n42%\nCapital expenditures\n(124)\n(143)\n(89)\nDistributions to noncontrolling interest holders\n(287)\n(280)\n(270)\nFree cash flow\n$\n5,278 \n$\n3,287 \n$\n2,244 \n61%\n46%\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n’24 vs ’23\n’23 vs ’22\nCash (used for) provided by investing activities\n(255)\n562 \n3,628 \nN/M\n(85)%\nCash used for financing activities\n(4,998)\n(4,280)\n(11,326)\n17%\n(62)%\nN/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. \nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nManagement considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&A.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n65\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nRevenue recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 1 - \nAccounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nBusiness combinations\nWe apply the purchase method of accounting to our business combinations. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration are allocated based on their estimated fair values. Fair value determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions about several highly subjective variables, including future cash flows, discount rates, and expected business performance. There are also different valuation models and inputs for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions may be based, in part, on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. Depending on the size of the purchase price of a particular acquisition, the mix of intangible assets acquired, and expected business performance, the purchase price allocation could be materially impacted by applying a different set of assumptions and estimates. \nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $29 million. \nWe incorporate the forecasted impact of future economic conditions into our allowance for doubtful accounts measurement process. In times of economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2025.\nAccounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets. \nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $35.8 billion and $35.7 billion, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nGoodwill\nAs part of our annual impairment test of our five reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. For 2024, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts. \n66\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.\nWe performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRetirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits\nOur employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.\nThe following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:\n•\nDiscount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.\n•\nThe expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.\nOur discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our U.S. retirement plans are as follows:\n \nRetirement Plans\nPostretirement Plans\nJanuary 1\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2025\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate \n5.74 \n%\n5.27 \n%\n5.63 \n%\n5.57 \n%\n5.18 \n%\n5.52 \n%\nReturn on assets\n6.25 \n%\n6.00 \n%\n6.00 \n%\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $1.0 billion in pension benefit obligation for our U.S. retirement plans. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an estimated decrease or increase to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $25 million. An increase or decrease of 1 percentage point in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease or increase of approximately $13 million to 2025 pension expense.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income. \nIncome taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.\n67\nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \n \nJudgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2025. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $8.5 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $4.7 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nThe fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $4.2 billion in redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Indices business on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ultimate amount paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business could be significantly different because the redemption amount depends on the future results of operations of the business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the weighted average cost of capital used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 10.6%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease or increase the redemption value by approximately $108 million or $81 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the terminal growth rate used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 2.2%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the redemption value by approximately $27 million or $54 million, respectively. \nRECENT\n \nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 1 – \nAccounting Policies \nto our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. We do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods. \n68\nTable of Contents",
