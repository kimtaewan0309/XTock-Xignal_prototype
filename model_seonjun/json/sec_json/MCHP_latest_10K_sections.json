Our strategic focus includes general purpose and specialized 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessors, analog, FPGA, and memory products.  In July 2024, we entered the 64-bit mixed-signal microprocessor market furthering our expansion beyond 32-bit architecture.  With over 35 years of technology leadership, our broad product portfolio offers a Total System Solution (TSS) for our customers that can provide a large portion of the silicon requirements in their applications.  TSS is a combination of hardware, software and services which help our customers increase their revenue, reduce their costs and manage their risks compared to other solutions.  Our synergistic product portfolio empowers disruptive growth trends, including AI/ML, data centers, edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT), E-mobility, networking and connectivity, and sustainability in key end markets such as automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, consumer appliances, data centers and computing, and industrial.\nIndustry Background\n \nCompetitive pressures require OEMs to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost.  To address these requirements, manufacturers often use integrated circuit-based embedded control systems that enable them to: \n•\ndifferentiate their products\n•\nreplace less efficient electromechanical control devices\n•\nreduce the number of components in their system\n•\nadd product functionality\n•\nreduce the system level energy consumption\n•\nmake systems safer to operate\n•\nreduce the consumption of natural resources\n•\nadd security to their products\n•\ndecrease time to market for their products\n•\nsignificantly reduce product cost\nEmbedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide, including:\n•\nactuators\n•\napplications requiring touch buttons, touch screens and graphical user interfaces\n•\nautomotive access control\n•\nautomotive comfort, safety, information and entertainment applications\n•\navionics\n•\ncommunication infrastructure systems\n•\nconsumer electronics\n•\ndata center solutions\n•\ndefense and military hardware\n•\nelectric vehicles\n•\nhandheld tools\n•\nhome and building automation\n•\nindustrial automation\n5\nTable of Contents\n•\nlarge and small home appliances\n•\nmedical devices\n•\nmotor controls\n•\nportable computers and accessories\n•\npower supplies\n•\nresidential and commercial security systems\n•\nrobotics\n•\nrouters and video surveillance systems\n•\nsatellites\n•\nsmart home, IoT and AI/ML edge devices\n•\nsmart meters and energy monitoring\n•\nstorage and server systems \n•\ntouch control\n•\nwireless communication\nEmbedded control systems typically incorporate a mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessor or FPGA as the principal active, and sometimes sole, component.  A mixed-signal microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, often with on-board non-volatile program memory for program storage, random access memory for data storage and various analog and digital input/output peripheral capabilities.  In addition to the mixed-signal microcontroller, a complete embedded control system often incorporates application-specific software, various analog, mixed-signal, timing, connectivity, security and non-volatile memory components such as EEPROMs and Flash memory.\n \nMixed-signal microcontrollers are primarily available in 8-bit through 32-bit architectures.  In July 2024, we entered the 64-bit mixed-signal microprocessor market furthering our expansion beyond 32-bit architecture.  8-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers remain very cost-effective and easy to use for a wide range of high-volume embedded control applications and, as a result, continue to represent a significant portion of the overall mixed-signal microcontroller market.  16-bit and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality, and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications.  FPGAs are programmable integrated circuits that are used to implement complex logic functions and can be re-programmed at any time, allowing for multiple implementations and revisions during or after the customer system is manufactured.  Some versions of FPGAs also include a mixed-signal microcontroller or microprocessor core to provide additional system on chip functionality to compute intensive tasks.  Microprocessors integrate 32-bit (or above) central processing units (CPUs) with various high performance peripherals, such as communications and graphics, and execute code from external memory, typically dynamic random access memory.  64-bit microprocessors offer even greater computational power and are often utilized in applications requiring advanced processing capabilities, such as data-intensive tasks and sophisticated system operations such as Linux. \nOur Products\nOur strategic focus is on providing cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, extreme low power usage, wide voltage range operation, mixed-signal integration, and ease of development, thus enabling timely and cost-effective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products.\nMixed-signal Microcontrollers\nWe offer a broad family of proprietary general purpose mixed-signal microcontroller products, with significant analog and mixed-signal functionality incorporated within them, which are marketed under multiple brand names.  We believe that our mixed-signal microcontroller product families provide leading function and performance characteristics in the worldwide market.  We target the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontroller and 32-bit embedded mixed-signal microprocessor markets.  In July 2024, we entered the 64-bit mixed-signal microprocessor market.  We also offer specialized mixed-signal microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications. \n \nWe leverage our circuit design, process technologies, development tools, applications knowledge, and manufacturing experiences to enable our customers to implement various embedded control functions in their end systems with our mixed-signal microcontrollers.\n \n \n6\nTable of Contents\nAnalog\n \nOur analog product line consists of several families including power management, linear, mixed-signal, high voltage, thermal management, discrete diodes and MOSFETS, RF, drivers, safety, security, timing, USB, ethernet, wireless and other interface products.  \n \nWe market and sell our analog product line into our mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessor and FPGA customer base, and to customers who use mixed-signal microcontrollers and FPGA products from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and memory products customer base.\n \nOther\nOur other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and products for aerospace applications.\nOur portfolio of non-volatile FPGAs are recognized for their low power, high security and extended reliability.  We market and sell our FPGA products and related solutions into a broad range of applications within the industrial, automotive, defense, aviation, space and communications markets. \nOur technology licensing business generates license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of our SuperFlash® embedded flash and other technologies.  We also generate fees for engineering services related to these technologies.  We license our Non-Volatile Memory technologies to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced mixed-signal microcontroller products, gate array, RF, analog and neuromorphic compute products that require embedded non-volatile memory.\nOur memory products consist of EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Parallel Flash memories, Serial SRAM memories and EERAMs.  Serial EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Serial SRAMs and EERAMs have a very low I/O pin requirement, permitting production of very small footprint devices.  We sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market, complementing our mixed-signal microcontroller offerings.\n \nDevelopment Tools\n \nWe offer a comprehensive set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development tools.  These tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products for specific applications and, we believe, they are an important factor for facilitating design wins.\n \nOur family of development tools for our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products range from entry-level systems, which include an assembler or a compiler\n \nand programmer or in-circuit debugging hardware, to fully configured systems that provide in-circuit emulation capability.  We also offer a complete suite of compilers, software code configurators and simulators.  Customers moving from entry-level designs to those requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future mixed-signal microcontroller devices in our portfolio.\nMany independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our mixed-signal microcontroller and microprocessor product architectures, including an extensive amount of third-party tool suppliers whose products support our mixed-signal microcontroller architectures.\n \nWe believe that familiarity with and adoption of development tools from Microchip as well as from third-party development tool partners by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products.  These development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our standard mixed-signal microcontrollers.\nManufacturing\n \nOur manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test.  The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (such as \n7\nTable of Contents\nstatistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields.  Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.  This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin.  We outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties.  We comply with several quality systems, including: ISO9001 (2015 version), IATF16949 (2016 version), AS9100 (2016 version), and TL9000.\nRefer to \"Item 2. Properties\" for further information regarding the location and principal operations of our manufacturing facilities.\nWafer Fabrication\n \n On March 3, 2025, we announced the closure of our Fab 2 manufacturing operations.  The Fab 2 closure was completed in May 2025 and the Fab 2 facility and equipment are currently available for sale.  With our inventory levels being high and having ample capacity in place, we announced our decision to close Fab 2, which we expect will generate annual cash savings of approximately $90 million.  All of the process technologies will be transferred from Fab 2 to Fab 4 and Fab 5 factories and many such technologies are already running in Fab 4 and Fab 5, both of which have ample clean room space for expansion. \n \nFab 4, located in Gresham, Oregon, currently produces 8-inch wafers using predominantly 0.13 microns to 0.5 microns manufacturing processes.  While select investments are still being made, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused our multi-year $800 million expansion and capital equipment investment plan at Fab 4 through fiscal 2026.  We plan to resume our expansion efforts to increase Fab 4's capacity as the business outlook improves. \nFab 5, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, currently manufactures discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products on 6-inch wafers.  In February 2023, we announced our plan to invest $880 million over the next several years to expand our silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon production capacity, including the production of 8-inch wafers, at our Fab 5 facility.  While select investments are still being made to reorganize our manufacturing capacity, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused our expansion activity through fiscal 2026.  We plan to resume our expansion efforts as the business outlook improves.\nWe believe the closure of Fab 2 and the combined capacity of Fab 4 and Fab 5 will allow us to respond to future demand for internally fabricated products with incremental capital expenditures.  Consistent with the macroeconomic environment during fiscal 2025, our capacity expansion activity at Fab 4 and Fab 5 remained paused and we have reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2026.\nIn addition to the Fab 2 closure, which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we reduced headcount at Fab 4, Fab 5 and our backend manufacturing facility in the Philippines.  We expect approximately $90 million in annual savings related to the closure of Fab 2, plus approximately $25 million in annual savings from the temporarily reduced compensation costs in Fab 4 and Fab 5. \nAs a result of our prior acquisition activity, we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities, which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture.  We currently plan to continue to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational and accommodate areas of growing demand.\nWe continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.  We believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive.\nIn fiscal 2025, approximately 36% of our sales came from products produced at our own wafer fabrication facilities that are located in the U.S.\n \nThere are benefits to having our own U.S. wafer fabrication facilities such as increased IP protection and security, increased supply chain resilience and the ability to manage production costs.  We augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer production requirements to third-party wafer foundries, including all of our 300mm wafer requirements and some of our 200mm and 150mm specialty process technologies.  In fiscal 2025, approximately 64% of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries.  Diversifying our wafer production geographically can help prevent disruptions that may be caused by geopolitical tensions, tariffs or natural disasters.\n \n8\nTable of Contents\nAssembly and Test \n \nWe perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world.  During fiscal 2025, we increased capabilities at our Thailand and Philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements, upgrading existing equipment, and adding equipment.  During fiscal 2025, approximately 67% of both our assembly requirements and our test requirements were performed in internal facilities.  We use third-party assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements.  We plan to continue to invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.\nGeneral Matters Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations\n \nDue to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results.  Our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities.  Our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control, extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment.  Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results.  The manufacture of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) memory and logic devices, such as those that we produce, are complex processes.  These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.  Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels.\nHistorically, we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules.  In order to respond to such requirements, we have historically maintained a significant work-in-process and finished goods inventory.  Refer to Note 3 for a summary of our long-lived assets, consisting of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, by geography.\n \nWe have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors that provide our various materials and service needs.  We generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services, but, in some cases, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers.\nSales and Distribution\n \nGeneral\n \nWe market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors to approximately 109,000 unique customers.\n \nOur direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets.  We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market.  Many of our CEMs, ESEs, and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments.  We believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products.  The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team.  ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts.\n \nOur licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees.\n \nFor information regarding our revenue, results of operations, and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years, refer to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n9\nTable of Contents\nDistribution\n \nOur distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.  We believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.\n \nIn fiscal 2025, we derived 45% of our net sales through distributors compared to 55% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us.  In fiscal 2024, we derived 47% of our net sales through distributors compared to 53% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us.  With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 10% and 12% of our net sales, in fiscal 2025 and in fiscal 2024, respectively, no distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales.\n \nGenerally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of orders otherwise designated as non-cancellable.  The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.\n \nCompetition\n \nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has historically been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change.  We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.  We also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied, cloned, pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as China and Taiwan.  We are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis.\nWe currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products, including the following product characteristics: \n•\nperformance\n•\nanalog, digital and mixed-signal functionality and level of functional integration\n•\nfield programmability\n•\nmemory density\n•\nlow power consumption\n•\nextended voltage ranges\n•\nreliability\n•\nsecurity and functional safety\n•\npackaging alternatives\n•\ncomprehensive suite of development tools\nWe believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include: \n•\nour broad product portfolio offers a Total System Solutions through a combination of hardware, software and services \n•\nease of use\n•\nfunctionality of application development systems\n•\nhardware, software and tool compatibility within product families to increase migration flexibility \n•\ndependable delivery, quality and availability\n•\ntechnical and innovative service and support\n•\ntime to market\n•\ntotal solution cost\n•\nreference design\nWe believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors, but if we are unable to compete successfully in the future, our business could be harmed.\n10\nTable of Contents\nPatents, Licenses and Trademarks\n \nWe maintain a portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents, expiring on various dates from 2025 through 2044.  We also have numerous additional U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  We do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our semiconductor business.  While our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes, we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products.  As with any operating company, the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets, including our pending and existing patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage.  Moreover, pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws.  Further, the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\n \nWe have also entered into certain in-bound and outbound intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we and our customers from time to time receive, and may continue to receive, demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights.  We diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate.  In most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, however, we cannot be certain that this would be the case, or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided.  Licensees of our technology may become unable to pay, and have in the past and are currently disputing their obligations to pay us royalties or fees.  Litigation, arbitration or other proceedings, which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management, has been and is expected to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others.  The failure to obtain necessary licenses, the necessity of engaging in defensive legal proceedings, or any negative results of these proceedings could harm our business.\nEnvironmental Regulation\n \nWe must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our products and manufacturing processes.  Our waste disposal programs in our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations.  However, any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could result in an increase in capital expenditures such as acquiring costly equipment or other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, use, discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities.\n \nIncreasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations.  While we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations, technological changes, or weather, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of, hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations.\n \nHuman Capital Resources\nOur Employees \nWe invest in our highly-skilled global workforce of approximately 19,400 people in accordance with our Guiding Value: employees are our greatest strength.  We believe that our culture, values, and organizational development and training programs provide a work environment where our employees are empowered and engaged to deliver the best embedded control solutions to our customers.\nCulture and Core Values\nBefore Microchip went public in 1993, Microchip created a cultural framework to unite its employees through shared workplace values, and to guide employees’ strategies, decisions, actions and job performance.  Our culture is centered on a values-based, highly-empowered, continuous-improvement oriented approach.  This corporate culture strengthens our business, and enables us to fulfill our purpose.  Our focus on communication aims to provide transparency among leadership, to promote trust among employees, and is a critical part of Microchip’s culture.  \n11\nTable of Contents\nOur culture is important to our employees, and is a key reason why we have a significant number of employees with long tenure with Microchip that have grown from individual contributors in the early stages of their careers into senior leadership positions today.  This long tenure among our employee-base results in deep relationships and trust being built among colleagues, retention of our knowledge base, and continuation of our culture.  More information on our Guiding Values can be found at www.microchip.com/en-us/about/investors/investor-information/mission-statement.\nWe promote employee adoption of our culture through a number of methods including training, mentorship, values-based performance reviews, company-wide quarterly meetings, town hall meetings with the President and Chief Executive Officer and other executive team members, and an open-door policy of communication where employees are encouraged to interact directly with management.  To assess and improve employee engagement, we conduct our annual employee engagement survey, which is administered in a manner that allows employees to respond confidentially.  The survey solicits feedback on a variety of factors, including engagement, culture, leadership, continuous improvement, collaboration, work environment, and ethics. \nTraining and Development \nMicrochip’s culture focuses on continuous improvement.  We provide training on our culture, management skills, communication, technical skills, and personal improvement.  Microchip also has a leadership program that provides for the growth and development of its future leaders.  This program helps us develop leaders that serve as role models of Microchip culture, and support empowerment and open communication. \nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer coaching, and ongoing feedback.  We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences.  We create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and regularly upgrade our offerings to help ensure that our employees are exposed to current content.  We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications.\nCompensation Programs\nWe strive to provide competitive pay and benefits, that help meet the varying needs of our employees and encourage employees to be shareholders in Microchip through our various equity incentive plans.  Our total compensation package includes base pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare and retirement plans, employee stock purchase plans, paid time off and family leave.  Benefit programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., and statutory pension programs outside the U.S.  Microchip has multiple equity programs in place including restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchase plans that align employee interests with those of our shareholders.\nInformation About our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of April 30, 2025:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nSteve Sanghi\n69\nExecutive Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President\nRichard J.

Risk Factors,\" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  We disclaim any obligation to update the information contained in any forward-looking statement.\n47\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document, as well as with other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  For an overview of our business and recent trends, refer to our \"Business and Macroeconomic Environment\" discussed below.\nWe begin our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) with a discussion of our Business and Macroeconomic Environment followed by the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.  We then discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"  Our liquidity and capital resources section generally discusses fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  For our discussion of our fiscal 2024 results compared to fiscal 2023 for both our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources sections, refer to \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on May 23, 2024 which is incorporated by reference herein. \nBusiness and Macroeconomic Environment\nDuring fiscal 2024, many of our customers felt the adverse effects of slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation and higher interest rates and we received requests to push out or cancel backlog resulting from customer actions to reduce inventory levels.  Although we began to see evidence of improvements in our business in the March 2024 quarter which have continued in fiscal 2025, such as a decrease in customer requests to push out or cancel backlog while the number of expedites and shipment pull in requests grew, the overall macroeconomic environment remained weak throughout fiscal 2025 as we navigated through a large inventory correction.  With our inventory levels being high and having ample capacity in place, on December 2, 2024, we announced our decision to close our Tempe, Arizona wafer fabrication facility that we refer to as Fab 2.  Many of the process technologies that run in Fab 2 also run in our Oregon and Colorado factories, which both have ample clean room space for expansion.  The closure of Fab 2 was completed in May 2025 and we expect that it will generate annual cash savings of approximately $90 million.  Due to the high levels of inventory of the products which are manufactured in Fab 2, we do not expect to see income statement savings from the closure until the start of the June 2026 quarter based on a first-in first-out basis.  We expect that the Fab 2 closure will begin to help us moderate our inventory levels.  On March 3, 2025, we announced additional restructuring actions to reduce costs, resize manufacturing operations and to reduce headcount at our Fab 4 and Fab 5 facilities and our backend manufacturing facility in the Philippines which will result in approximately $25 million in annual savings from the temporarily reduced compensation costs.  These actions resulted in a reduction of inventory in the March 2025 quarter.  We also announced a 10% headcount reduction across our company to decrease our operating expenses, which reduction will be fully implemented by the June 2025 quarter.  We expect this action to reduce our ongoing operating expenses by approximately $90 million to $100 million on an annualized basis.  Consistent with the macroeconomic environment, most of our factory expansion activity remains paused, we have reduced our planned capital investments, and we remain focused on reducing our inventory levels and days of inventory through fiscal 2026.\nThere continues to be uncertainty regarding overall macroeconomic conditions, including increased geopolitical tensions, risk of a recession, and the effects of potential trade policies, including tariffs.  Long established global trade relationships are potentially changing in fundamental ways that make it difficult to predict how global supply chains and economic environments will be affected.  For example, in March and April 2025, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from China and other countries and foreign governments imposed additional tariffs on imports from the U.S.  It is unclear what tariffs will apply to semiconductors during this time of change.  \nWhile we continue to evaluate the potential impacts of these proposed tariffs and our ability to mitigate their related impacts, these tariffs and any retaliatory tariffs imposed may adversely impact our revenue and cost of goods sold in the U.S. and internationally.  The imposition of tariffs could impact our supply chain for rare earth and other materials and cause a decrease in the sales of products to customers located in China, other customers selling to Chinese end users, or other global customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The ultimate impact of any tariffs will depend on various factors, including whether semiconductors continue to be exempt from tariffs and any changes to the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs imposed by the U.S. or other countries.  For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, including the risk factor titled “\nWe may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials, components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers' needs, increase prices, are impacted by increases in tariffs, or such raw materials, components or equipment become restricted or unavailable.\"\n48\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\n \nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes and contingencies.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.  We review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  \nRevenue Recognition \nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and non-distributor customers (direct customers).  We apply the following five-step approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.\nSales of semiconductor products to our customers are governed by a purchase order, an order acknowledgment, and a distributor agreement in the case of our distributor customers.  Sales to customers do not meet the definition of a contract until the customer has sent in a purchase order, we have acknowledged the order, we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable, and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created.  As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors.  As these are forms of variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method.  Substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with customers is recognized at, or near to, the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with distributor customers, based on our assumptions, have been materially consistent with our actual results.  However, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.  A 100-basis point increase in the blended price concession rate would have changed the measurement of our refund liability recorded within accrued liabilities by $5.0 million as of March 31, 2025.\nInventories\n \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.  We record a charge to cost of sales to write down our inventory for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.  Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable.  In determining whether there is a risk of excess or obsolete inventory, we evaluate projected demand over periods that align with demand forecasts used to develop manufacturing plans and inventory build decisions and write down inventory on hand that is in excess of estimated demand.  Management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations.  For example, demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand.  Alternatively, demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued.  A 1% variance in the estimated demand for our products would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately $3.8 million as of March 31, 2025.\n \n49\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\n \nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to record our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nVarious taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business may scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses.  Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations.  We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions.  At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be.  We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law.  If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized.  If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.  \nThe accounting model related to the measurement of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions.  The recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue.  We will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period.  Generally, adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement.  Generally, adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the closing of a statutory audit period or changes in applicable law, or interactions with taxing authorities.  Due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process, including the complexity involved to interpret and apply tax laws, and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model, amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model.\nResults of Operations\n \nThe following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024:\nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales\n43.9 \n34.6 \nGross profit\n56.1 \n65.4 \nResearch and development\n22.4 \n14.4 \nSelling, general and administrative\n14.0 \n9.6 \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n11.2 \n7.9 \nSpecial charges (income) and other, net\n1.8 \n(0.2)\nOperating income\n6.7 \n%\n33.7 \n%\nNet Sales\n \nWe operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our SuperFlash and other technologies.  We sell our products to distributors and OEMs in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral.  In certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our net sales for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 (dollars in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n4,401.6 \n$\n7,634.4 \n(42.3)\n%\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in net sales in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation, high interest rates, and shorter product lead times, which factors resulted in many customers having higher levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders.  Due to the size, complexity and diversity of our customer base, we are not able to quantify any material factor contributing to the changes in net sales.  See our \"Business and Macroeconomic Environment\" discussion above for further information on our business outlook. \nOther factors that we believe contributed to the decrease in our reported net sales for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 and which are drivers of long-term trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include:\n•\neconomic and competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry;\n•\nour various new product offerings that have increased our served available market;\n•\ncustomers’ needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions; \n•\nincreasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products; and\n•\ngeopolitical conditions, tariffs and other trade restrictions.\nWe sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024.    \nNet sales by product line for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 were as follows (dollars in millions): \nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nMixed-signal Microcontrollers\n$\n2,249.7 \n51.1 \n$\n4,272.4 \n56.0 \nAnalog\n1,157.0 \n26.3 \n2,016.4 \n26.4 \nOther\n994.9 \n22.6 \n1,345.6 \n17.6 \nTotal net sales\n$\n4,401.6 \n100.0 \n$\n7,634.4 \n100.0 \nMixed-signal Microcontrollers\n \nOur mixed-signal microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales.  Mixed-signal microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 51.1% and 56.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.\n \nNet sales of our mixed-signal microcontroller products decreased approximately 47.3% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  The decrease in net sales was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, competitive pressures, persistent inflation, high interest rates, and shorter product lead times, which factors resulted in many customers having higher levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders. \nHistorically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product.  However, the overall average selling prices of our mixed-signal microcontroller products have remained relatively stable in recent periods due to the proprietary nature of these products.  We have in the past been able to moderate average selling price declines in our mixed-signal microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices.  \nAnalog\n \nOur analog product line includes analog, interface, mixed-signal and timing products.  Our analog product line accounted for approximately 26.3% and 26.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.\nNet sales from our analog product line decreased approximately 42.6% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  The decrease in net sales was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation, high interest rates, and shorter product lead times, which factors resulted in many customers having higher levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders.\n \nWe consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our mixed-signal microcontroller products.  The non-proprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products.  \n51\nTable of Contents\nOther\n \nOur other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and certain products for aerospace applications.  Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 22.6% and 17.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.  \n Net sales related to these products and services decreased approximately 26.1% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  This decrease in net sales was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation, high interest rates, and shorter product lead times, which factors resulted in many customers having higher levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders.  In fiscal 2025, we settled an ongoing legal matter with one of our licensees which resulted in the release of an accrual, which increased both our revenue and profits by $13.3 million in such fiscal period.  Net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our FPGA products, licenses, engineering services, memory products, timing systems, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).\n  \nDistribution\n \nDistributors accounted for approximately 45% and 47% of our net sales in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.  With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which accounted for 10% and 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2025 and in fiscal 2024, respectively, no other distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2025 or in fiscal 2024.  Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base and that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.\nGenerally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice.  The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.\n \nAt March 31, 2025, our distributors maintained 33 days of inventory of our products compared to 41 days at March 31, 2024.  Over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 17 days and 43 days.  Inventory holding patterns at our distributors have had a material adverse impact on our net sales in recent periods.  Due to the relatively high level of inventory days, we have accommodated efforts by our distributors to manage their inventory levels by allowing them to push-out or cancel orders.\nSales by Geography\n \nSales by geography for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nAmericas\n$\n1,325.7 \n30.2 \n$\n2,215.4 \n29.0 \nEurope\n878.1 \n19.9 \n1,851.7 \n24.3 \nAsia\n2,197.8 \n49.9 \n3,567.3 \n46.7 \nTotal net sales\n$\n4,401.6 \n100.0 \n$\n7,634.4 \n100.0 \nAmericas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America.  Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75% of our total net sales in each of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.  The decrease in net sales in the European market in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was due to general weakness in the European economy, and decreases in our net sales in the European industrial and automotive markets, which were particularly weak.  Our net sales in the Americas and Asia market decreased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, persistent inflation, high interest rates, and shorter product lead times which resulted in delayed or reduced orders.  Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated.  Our sales force in the Americas and Europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia. \n \n52\nTable of Contents\nGross Profit\n \nOur gross profit in fiscal 2025 was $2.47 billion, or 56.1% of net sales, compared to $5.00 billion, or 65.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2024.  \nThe primary reason for the decrease in gross profit of $2.34 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was an unfavorable net impact of sales volume, product mix, geographic mix, and average gross profit per unit in fiscal 2025.  The net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit may fluctuate over time due to the mix of sales volumes of lower or higher margin products, changes in selling prices, and fluctuations in product costs.  We are not able to separately quantify these impacts on our gross profit.  The impact of unabsorbed capacity charges was an adverse impact of $132.3 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  Unabsorbed capacity charges are expensed as incurred when we operate our manufacturing facilities below normal levels.  The net impact to our gross profit from inventory reserve charges was an adverse impact of $87.7 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  The gross margin impact of changes in licensing revenue, which has no associated cost of sales, was a favorable impact of $27.7 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  \nOur overall inventory levels were $1.29 billion at March 31, 2025, compared to $1.32 billion at March 31, 2024.  We maintained 251 days of inventory on our balance sheet at March 31, 2025 compared to 224 days of inventory at March 31, 2024.  Our overall inventory level in dollars was generally flat as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, customer demand and inventory levels.  However, our days of inventory increased significantly due to lower net sales.  Our inventory amounts are impacted by timing of shipment activity in the quarter, the timing of receipt of raw materials, foundry wafers, and strategic last time buy materials and completion of finished goods.  We believe that our current inventory and production capacity are adequate to fulfill the projected requirements of our customers.\n \nWe operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand, the Philippines, and other locations throughout the world.  During fiscal 2025, approximately 67% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities, compared to approximately 59% during fiscal 2024.  During fiscal 2025, approximately 67% of our test requirements were performed in our internal facilities, compared to approximately 71% during fiscal 2024.  The percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities.  We believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to third-party contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process.  We plan to continue to selectively invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.\nWe rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements.  Approximately 64% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in each of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.  This percentage may vary based on supply and demand conditions in the market.\nWe anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall mix of products sold during the period, as well as manufacturing yields, unabsorbed capacity charges, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve.  We continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses for fiscal 2025 were $983.8 million, or 22.4% of net sales, compared to $1.10 billion, or 14.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2024.  We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  R&D costs are expensed as incurred.  Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives.  R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.\nR&D expenses decreased $113.6 million, or 10.4%, for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  The primary reasons for the decrease in R&D expenses in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was lower employee compensation costs.\n \nR&D expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.\n53\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2025 were $617.7 million, or 14.0% of net sales, compared to $734.2 million, or 9.6% of net sales, for fiscal 2024.  Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling, general and administrative expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $116.5 million, or 15.9%, for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.  The primary reason for the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was lower employee compensation costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2025 was $490.9 million compared to $605.4 million in fiscal 2024.  The primary reason for the decrease in acquired intangible asset amortization was due to the use of accelerated amortization methods for assets placed in service in previous fiscal years.\nSpecial Charges (Income) and Other, Net \nDuring fiscal 2025, we incurred special charges and other, net of $79.2 million primarily due to restructuring expenses, including $45.7 million related to contract exit costs and $27.1 million related to employee separation costs.  During fiscal 2024, we earned special income and other, net of $12.3 million primarily related to a favorable resolution of a previously accrued legal matter partially offset by restructuring costs of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency.  Restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2024 include $6.2 million related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest income in fiscal 2025 was $9.2 million compared to $7.6 million in fiscal 2024.\nInterest expense in fiscal 2025 was $259.2 million compared to $198.3 million in fiscal 2024.  The primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 were higher interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt and higher outstanding debt balances, offset in part by lower interest expense on our revolving credit facility.\nLoss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2025 was $1.7 million compared to $12.2 million in fiscal 2024.  In fiscal 2025, the loss primarily related to the amendment and restatement of our Revolving Credit Facility.  In fiscal 2024, the loss related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding Convertible Debt. \nOther loss, net, in fiscal 2025 was $5.7 million compared to other loss, net of $2.2 million in fiscal 2024.  The primary reason for the change in other loss during fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 relates to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes.  Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, increased over the same period last year as a result of changes in the amount of pre-tax income earned, R&D credits, foreign operations and various tax reserves.\nOur effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 includes a $60.1 million tax benefit received from current year generated R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 154.4%; a $55.0 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations, which increased our effective tax rate by 141.3%; and a $45.1 million tax expense related to changes in various tax reserves, which increased our effective tax rate by 115.8%.\n54\nTable of Contents\nOur effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 includes a $69.8 million tax benefit received from R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.0%; and a $62.9 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations, which increased our effective tax rate by 2.7%.\nWe are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations.  The effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined U.S. federal and state effective tax rate.  Our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 was approximately 22%.  Our non-U.S. blended statutory tax rates in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 were lower than this amount.  The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, financing arrangements and other factors.  Our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.\nOur foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations in Malta taxed at a 5.0% statutory tax rate and Ireland taxed at a 12.5% statutory tax rate.  Additionally, our Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant, and equipment in Thailand.  Our tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20.0%.  We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nIn September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2007 to 2012 Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012.  The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters.  In December 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2007 to 2012 Notice.  In September 2023, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016.  In October 2023, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2014 to 2015 Notice) from the IRS for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015.  The disputed amounts for fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016 largely relate to transfer pricing matters.  In December 2023, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2014 to 2015 Notice.\nIn May 2023, we received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for fiscal 2020.  In December 2023, we received a Notice of Assessment from the IRB asserting the same proposed income adjustment.  In March 2025, we entered into a Consent Judgment before the High Court, agreeing that the dispute will be heard before the Special Commissioners of Income Tax (SCIT).  It was also agreed that the payment on the taxes assessed is stayed and the IRB will pause all enforcement and proceedings against the collection of the taxes assessed until the appeal before the SCIT is concluded.  If the adjustment is upheld by the highest court that has jurisdiction over this matter in Malaysia, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $410.0 million.  The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization of certain assets.  The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could occur in the next 12 months.\nIn January 2025, we received several assessments from the German Tax Authorities (GTA) regarding the German extraterritorial taxation of royalty payments between nonresidents (referred to as offshore receipts in respect of intangible property or ORIP) and intellectual property transfers by nonresidents (referred to as extraterritorial capital gains taxation or ETT).  If the assessment is upheld, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $92.0 million.  The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could occur in the next 12 months.\nWe firmly believe that the assessments described above are without merit and we plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter.  We intend to vigorously defend our position, and we are confident in our ability to prevail on the merits.  We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as these to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves.  The ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS, IRB and GTA were to prevail on their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n \n \nVarious taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses.  Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations.  For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities.  We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions.  At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be.  We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law.  If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized.  If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. \n55\nTable of Contents\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act into law.  The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) of 15.0% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.00 billion over a three-year period, as well as a 1% excise tax on the net fair market value of stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022.  The Corporate AMT is effective beginning in fiscal 2024.  The Inflation Reduction Act did not have a material impact on the year ending March 31, 2025 and the year ending March 31, 2024.\nAs of March 31, 2025, 55 countries have enacted various aspects of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project to ensure that multinational enterprises pay a GMT.  In 38 of those countries, the GMT is effective for tax years beginning in our fiscal 2025.  As of March 31, 2025, the impact of GMT on our fiscal 2025 results is not material.   \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n \nWe had $771.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2025, an increase of $452.0 million from the March 31, 2024 balance.  \n \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $898.1 million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to net loss of $0.5 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $798.5 million and net cash inflows of $100.1 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2025 include a decrease in trade accounts receivable driven primarily by reduced revenue and timing of shipments and collections, a decrease in inventories, offset by decreases in accrued liabilities driven by decreases in sales related reserves, and a decrease due to cash refunded to our customers under the LTSAs.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.89 billion in fiscal 2024 primarily due to net income of $1.91 billion, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.06 billion and net cash outflows of $76.7 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $287.8 million for fiscal 2025 compared to $392.1 million for fiscal 2024.  Fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, investing cash flows primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets.\n \nOur level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.  Capital expenditures were $126.0 million and $285.1 million in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.  Capital expenditures were primarily for the selective expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment.  Consistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025, we have paused most of our factory expansion actions and reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2026.  Our investments in equipment and facilities during the next 12 months are expected to be at or below $100 million.  We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.  We expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.\n \n While select investments are still being made, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused most of our expansion activity.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced the closure of Fab 2 in Tempe, Arizona which was completed in May 2025.  Despite pausing our expansion activity, we believe that our current inventory and production capacity are adequate to fulfill the projected requirements of our customers.  In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry.  In December 2023, we reached a Preliminary Memorandum of Terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for $162 million in CHIPS Act grants for two of our U.S. wafer fabrication facilities; however, we have not concluded negotiations with the U.S. Department of Commerce and there can be no assurance that the grants will receive final approval.  If we do receive a CHIPS Act grant, the restrictions and operational requirements that are imposed on CHIPS Act grant recipients could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs.  We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and may apply for other incentives provided by the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such other incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position.  \n \n56\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $158.3 million for fiscal 2025 compared to $2.41 billion for fiscal 2024.  Significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows included:\n•\nin fiscal 2025, $1.45 billion of net proceeds from the issuances of our Series A Preferred Stock, and\n•\nin fiscal 2025, $516.5 million of net cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt including settlement of our 2020 Convertible Debt, settlement of our 2025 Term Loan Facility, purchase of our capped call options, and the repayment of our 0.983% 2024 Notes partially funded by proceeds from the issuances of our 4.900% 2028 Senior Notes, our 5.050% 2030 Senior Notes, our 2024 Senior Convertible Debt and our Commercial Paper, and\n•\nin fiscal 2024, $537.7 million of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including settlement of a portion of our outstanding Convertible Debt, our 4.333% 2023 Notes, our 2.670% 2023 Notes, our 0.972% 2024 Notes, and our Revolving Credit Facility, partially funded by proceeds from borrowings on our 2025 Term Loan Facility, proceeds from the issuance of our Commercial Paper, and proceeds from the issuance of our 5.050% 2029 Notes, and\n•\nin fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of $975.7 million and $911.5 million, respectively, and\n•\nin fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $96.5 million and $982.1 million, respectively. \nIn March 2025, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement pursuant to which the amended and restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2021 was amended and restated in its entirety.  The second amended and restated Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.25 billion, with a $250.0 million foreign currency sublimit, a $25.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $20.0 million swingline loan sublimit.  The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended the maximum total leverage ratio financial covenant to the following: 5.50 to 1.00 for period ending March 31, 2025, 5.50 to 1.00 for period ending June 30, 2025, 6.25 to 1.00 for period ending September 30, 2025, 5.75 to 1.00 for period ending December 31, 2025, 4.75 to 1.00 for period ending March 31, 2026, 4.00 to 1.00 for period ending June 30, 2026, 3.75 to 1.00 for period ending September 30, 2026, and 3.50 to 1.00 for any such period ended after the Restatement Effective Date that is not a period ending during the Covenant Relief Period.  The Covenant Relief Period means the period following the Restatement Effective Date to (but excluding) the earlier of (a) December 31, 2026 and (b) the date in which the Total Leverage Ratio for the most recently ended fiscal quarter shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 and certain other conditions are satisfied.  In November 2024, the amended and restated Credit Agreement, was amended to amend the maximum total leverage ratio financial covenant for the quarterly periods ending on December 31, 2024 through December 31, 2025 to 4.75 to 1.00.  In August 2023, our amended and restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2021 was amended by the first incremental term loan amendment, dated as of August 31, 2023.  Pursuant to this amendment, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million under the new 2025 Term Loan Facility bearing interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.5%, or Alternate Base Rate, plus a margin of 0.125% to 0.5%, with a maturity date of August 31, 2025, which was repaid in full in December 2024.  The interest rate margins are determined based on our credit ratings.  \nIn September 2023, we established a Commercial Paper program under which we may issue short-term unsecured promissory notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $2.75 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue.  The Commercial Paper is sold from time to time at a discount from par or alternatively, sold at par and bears interest rates that will vary based on market conditions and the time of issuance.  Our intention is to reduce the amounts that would otherwise be available to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility by the outstanding amount of Commercial Paper.  Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in March 2025, the maximum principal amount outstanding at any time under the Commercial Paper program was updated to $2.25 billion.  As of March 31, 2025, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $5.66 billion.  We had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at March 31, 2025 and at March 31, 2024.  At March 31, 2025, we had $175.0 million in outstanding principal amount of Commercial Paper compared to $1.36 billion at March 31, 2024.  \nIn March 2025, we issued 29.7 million Depositary Shares, representing approximately 1.5 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock.  The Series A Preferred Stock has a $1,000.00 per share liquidation preference and $0.001 per share par value.  As a result of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $1.45 billion, net of underwriting fees and other issuance costs.\n57\nTable of Contents\nCapital Returns\nIn November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  In fiscal 2025, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock for $90.0 million under this authorization.  In fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 11.9 million shares of our common stock for $982.1 million under this authorization.  As of March 31, 2025, approximately $1.56 billion remained available for repurchases under the program.  As of March 31, 2025, we held approximately 39.3 million shares as treasury shares.  Any future repurchases of shares of our common stock will be evaluated based on our cash generation, leverage metrics, and market conditions.\nIn October 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.  To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $7.63 billion.  A quarterly dividend of $0.455 per share was declared on May 8, 2025 and will be paid on June 5, 2025 to stockholders of record as of May 22, 2025.  We expect the aggregate cash dividend for the June 2025 quarter to be approximately $245.1 million.  Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  Our current intent is to maintain our level of quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from issuance of our Commercial Paper will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital requirements, interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, cash dividends, share repurchases, and income tax payments.  For additional information regarding our cash requirements see \"Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies\", \"Note 10. Leases\", \"Note 6. Debt\" and \"Note 12. Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements.  The semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development and to expand our existing facilities or potentially construct new facilities.  We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Commercial Paper program or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to refinance our existing debt, maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.  The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the maturity dates of our existing debt, our level of dividend payments on our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash, demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates.  We plan to refinance certain of our existing notes as they mature and we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our other outstanding debt or Convertible Debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, term loans, Commercial Paper, tender offers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases.  Such issuances, tender offers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors.  There can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from tariffs, high interest rates, high inflation, economic uncertainty, instability in the banking sector, public health concerns, or other factors, and any additional equity financing or convertible debt financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.  \nSummarized Financial Information\nThe tables below present the summarized financial information on a combined basis for Microchip Technology Incorporated and the following subsidiaries of Microchip Technology Incorporated that provide guarantees of our Senior Notes: Atmel Corporation, Microchip Holding Corporation, Microchip Technology LLC, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, and Microchip Storage Solutions LLC (such subsidiaries collectively, the Subsidiary Obligors).
