Amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period.\nFinancial Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025\n•\nNet income attributable to Chubb was $2.8 billion compared with $2.3 billion in the prior year period. Net income in the current year quarter was primarily driven by double-digit growth in both P&C underwriting income and Life segment income and higher net investment income. \n•\nConsolidated net premiums written were $14.87 billion, up 7.5 percent, or 6.8 percent in constant dollars. \n•\nP&C net premiums written were $12.93 billion, up 5.3 percent, or 4.7 percent in constant dollars, with commercial insurance up 2.9 percent and consumer insurance up 10.1 percent in constant dollars. Overall growth in commercial lines reflects strong new business and retention highlighted by middle market and small commercial P&C, excess and surplus (E&S), crop insurance, large account casualty, and financial lines. Consumer insurance growth reflects strong new business and retention, including positive rate and exposure increases. The increase in P&C net premiums was partially offset by two non-recurring items that benefited the prior year quarter in the North America commercial P&C segment, which unfavorably impacted growth by 1.5 percentage points.\n•\nLife Insurance net premiums written were $1.9 billion, up 24.6 percent, or 23.5 percent in constant dollars, due to growth in international life of 25.1 percent in constant dollars, predominantly in North Asia, and Combined North America of 18.1 percent, primarily driven by worksite business. Growth includes $126 million from a one-\n54\nTable of Contents\ntime large transaction in New Zealand. Life Insurance segment income was $324 million, up 14.2 percent, or 13.9 percent in constant dollars.\n•\nPre-tax net investment income was $1.65 billion, up 9.3 percent compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year period, primarily due to higher average invested assets.\n•\nOperating cash flow was $3.6 billion.\nNet Premiums Written\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n%\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n%\nChange\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2025\n \n2024 \nQ-25 vs. Q-24\nC$\nQ-25 vs. Q-24\n2025\n \n2024 \nYTD-25 vs. YTD-24\nC$\nYTD-25 vs. YTD-24\nProperty and other short-tail lines\n$\n2,428\n \n$\n2,314 \n4.9 \n%\n4.4 \n%\n$\n7,683\n \n$\n7,389 \n4.0 \n%\n4.5 \n%\nCommercial casualty\n2,627\n \n2,548 \n3.1 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n7,268\n \n6,913 \n5.1 \n%\n5.2 \n%\nFinancial lines\n1,349\n \n1,249 \n8.0 \n%\n7.2 \n%\n3,706\n \n3,594 \n3.1 \n%\n3.4 \n%\nWorkers' compensation\n537\n \n539 \n(0.2)\n%\n(0.2)\n%\n1,722\n \n1,727 \n(0.3)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nCommercial multiple peril\n \n(1)\n462\n \n433 \n6.8 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n1,359\n \n1,229 \n10.6 \n%\n10.6 \n%\nSurety\n203\n \n188 \n7.5 \n%\n8.2 \n%\n628\n \n572 \n9.7 \n%\n13.1 \n%\nTotal Commercial P&C lines\n7,606\n \n7,271 \n4.6 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n22,366\n \n21,424 \n4.4 \n%\n4.8 \n%\nAgriculture\n1,458\n \n1,379 \n5.6 \n%\n5.6 \n%\n2,467\n \n2,386 \n3.4 \n%\n3.4 \n%\nPersonal homeowners\n1,403\n \n1,287 \n9.1 \n%\n9.0 \n%\n3,958\n \n3,707 \n6.8 \n%\n7.1 \n%\nPersonal automobile\n780\n \n624 \n24.9 \n%\n25.2 \n%\n2,192\n \n1,880 \n16.6 \n%\n22.0 \n%\nPersonal other\n538\n \n509 \n5.7 \n%\n3.0 \n%\n1,705\n \n1,594 \n7.0 \n%\n6.8 \n%\nTotal Personal lines\n2,721\n \n2,420 \n12.4 \n%\n11.9 \n%\n7,855\n \n7,181 \n9.4 \n%\n10.8 \n%\nGlobal A&H - P&C \n845\n \n855 \n(1.2)\n%\n(3.8)\n%\n2,474\n \n2,532 \n(2.3)\n%\n(2.0)\n%\nReinsurance lines\n304\n \n352 \n(13.5)\n%\n(13.8)\n%\n1,092\n \n1,122 \n(2.6)\n%\n(2.7)\n%\nTotal Property and Casualty lines\n12,934\n \n12,277 \n5.3 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n36,254\n \n34,645 \n4.6 \n%\n5.2 \n%\nLife Insurance\n1,932\n \n1,552 \n24.6 \n%\n23.5 \n%\n5,454\n \n4,765 \n14.5 \n%\n17.0 \n%\nTotal consolidated\n$\n14,866\n \n$\n13,829 \n7.5 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n$\n41,708\n \n$\n39,410 \n5.8 \n%\n6.6 \n%\n(1)\nCommercial multiple peril represents retail package business (property and general liability).\nFor additional information on net premiums written, refer to the segment operating results discussions.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophe Losses and Prior Period Development\nWe generally define catastrophe loss events consistent with the definition of the Property Claims Service (PCS) for events in the U.S. and Canada. PCS defines a catastrophe as an event that causes damage of $25 million or more in insured losses and affects a significant number of insureds. For events outside of the U.S. and Canada, we generally use a similar definition. Catastrophe losses are net of reinsurance and include reinstatement premiums, which are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. The reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted.\nPrior period development (PPD) arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. PPD includes adjustments relating to either profit commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. The expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies. \nRefer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section for further information on reinstatement premiums on catastrophe losses and adjustments to prior period development.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nSeptember 30\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet catastrophe losses\n$\n285\n \n$\n765 \n$\n2,556\n \n$\n1,780 \nFavorable prior period development\n$\n361\n \n$\n244 \n$\n865\n \n$\n643 \nCatastrophe losses through September 30, 2025 and 2024, were primarily from the following events:\n•\n2025: California wildfire losses of $1.47 billion; flooding in the U.S., hail, tornadoes, wind events; global earthquakes, principally in Thailand; and winter storm losses.\n◦\nTotal North America P&C Insurance catastrophe losses were $237 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\n◦\nTotal Overseas General catastrophe losses were $42 million and $349 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\n•\n2024: Severe weather-related events in the U.S. and internationally.\n◦\nTotal North America P&C Insurance catastrophe losses were $599 million and $1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n◦\nTotal Overseas General catastrophe losses were $103 million and $286 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nPre-tax net favorable PPD for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was $422 million in our active companies, including net favorable development of $460 million in short-tail lines and net unfavorable development of $38 million in long-tail lines. Net favorable development for short-tail lines is driven by property lines. Net unfavorable development for long-tail lines primarily relates to casualty lines, partially offset by favorable development in workers' compensation. Our corporate run-off portfolio had adverse development of $61 million, primarily driven by adverse development for environmental-related claims.\nPre-tax net favorable PPD for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was $1.0 billion in our active companies, including net favorable development of $1.05 billion in short-tail lines and net adverse development of $42 million in long-tail lines. Net favorable development for short-tail lines primarily includes surety, property, and marine lines. Net adverse development for long-tail lines reflects favorable development primarily in workers' compensation offset by adverse development in general casualty lines. Our corporate run-off portfolio had adverse development of $144 million, primarily driven by adverse development for environmental and molestation-related claims.\nPre-tax net favorable PPD for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $299 million in our active companies, including net favorable development of $358 million in short-tail lines and net adverse development of $59 million in long-tail lines. Net favorable development for short-tail lines primarily includes property and marine lines. Net adverse development for long-tail lines reflects favorable development primarily in workers' compensation offset by adverse development in general casualty lines. Our corporate run-off portfolio had adverse development of $55 million, primarily driven by adverse development for environmental-related claims.\n56\nTable of Contents\nPre-tax net favorable PPD for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $800 million in our active companies, principally in short-tail property and marine lines. Our corporate run-off portfolio had adverse development of $157 million,  primarily driven by adverse development for environmental and molestation-related claims.\nRefer to the prior period development discussion in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nP&C Combined Ratio\nIn evaluating our segments, excluding Life Insurance financial performance, we use the P&C combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. We do not calculate these ratios for the Life Insurance segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage the business in that segment. The P&C combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. A P&C combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss. P&C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses (CATs) excludes CATs and prior period development (PPD) from the P&C combined ratio.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nSeptember 30\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nCombined ratio:\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n56.7\n \n%\n63.1 \n%\n60.8\n \n%\n60.8 \n%\nPolicy acquisition cost ratio\n17.7\n \n%\n17.2 \n%\n18.5\n \n%\n18.0 \n%\nAdministrative expense ratio\n7.4\n \n%\n7.4 \n%\n8.0\n \n%\n8.1 \n%\nP&C Combined ratio\n81.8\n \n%\n87.7 \n%\n87.3\n \n%\n86.9 \n%\nCatastrophe losses\n(2.3)\n%\n(6.4)\n%\n(7.4)\n%\n(5.5)\n%\nPrior period development\n3.0\n \n%\n2.1 \n%\n2.5\n \n%\n2.0 \n%\nP&C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses\n82.5\n \n%\n83.4 \n%\n82.4\n \n%\n83.4 \n%\nThe P&C combined ratio decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and higher favorable prior period development, and the impact of a large structured transaction that had an unfavorable impact to the ratio in the prior year period. The P&C combined ratio increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting California wildfire losses of $1.47 billion, including the unfavorable impact of $37 million of net ceded reinstatement premiums on the expense ratio (i.e., lower premium resulting in a higher expense ratio). The increase was partially offset by higher favorable prior period development.\nThe P&C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting lower losses, partially offset by an increase in the policy acquisition cost ratio from changes in mix of business.\nRefer to the respective sections that follow for a discussion of Net investment income, Other (income) expense, Net realized gains (losses), Interest expense, Amortization of purchased intangibles, and Income tax expense.\n57\nTable of Contents\nSegment Operating Results – Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nWe operate through six business segments: North America Commercial P&C Insurance, North America Personal P&C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance.

Middle market and small commercial grew 3.6 percent, including a 3.3 percentage point unfavorable impact of lower workers’ compensation annual payroll-related audit premium adjustments, which are made in the third quarter every year. Major accounts and specialty were up 2.5 percent, and includes a 3.4 percent unfavorable impact from a one-off structured transaction which occurred in 2024, with E&S up 6.6 percent.\nNet premiums written increased $483 million, or 3.1 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which includes P&C lines growth of 2.9 percent and financial lines growth of 3.9 percent. Middle market and small commercial grew 6.5 percent, with P&C lines up 8.1 percent and financial lines up 0.7 percent. Major accounts retail and specialty grew 0.9 percent, with property and other short-tail lines down 3.1 percent, casualty up 4.9 percent, and financial lines up 7.7 percent. \nThe increase in premiums was across a number of lines, most notably in primary and excess casualty and in our small and mid-market commercial E&S, reflecting new business and rate increases. The increases were partially offset by rate decreases in our Large Risk and E&S brokerage property lines.\nNet premiums earned decreased $30 million, or 0.6 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and increased $355 million, or 2.4 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, both reflecting the growth in net premiums written described above. The growth for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was unfavorably impacted by the one-off structured transaction described above and lower workers' compensation annual payroll-related audit premium adjustments that were fully earned when written.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting lower catastrophe losses. The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was relatively flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting a change in the mix of business and earned rate exceeding loss trends in certain lines, partially offset by higher loss trends relative to earned rate growth in financial lines, and an increase in the expense ratio reflecting one-off benefits in the prior year. The ratio was also favorably impacted from lower year-over-year large structured transactions as described above.\n59\nTable of Contents\nNorth America Personal P&C Insurance\nThe North America Personal P&C Insurance segment comprises operations that provide high net worth personal lines products, including homeowners and complementary products such as valuable articles, excess liability, automobile, and recreational marine insurance and services in the U.S. and Canada. \n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30\n% Change\nSeptember 30\n% Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2025\n \n2024 \nQ-25 vs. Q-24\n2025\n \n2024 \nYTD-25 vs. YTD-24\nNet premiums written\n$\n1,814\n \n$\n1,679 \n8.1 \n%\n$\n5,304\n \n$\n4,911 \n \n8.0 \n%\nNet premiums earned\n1,741\n \n1,577 \n10.5 \n%\n4,996\n \n4,560 \n \n9.6 \n%\nLosses and loss expenses\n713\n \n879 \n(18.8)\n%\n3,628\n \n2,654 \n \n36.7 \n%\nPolicy acquisition costs\n339\n \n315 \n7.5 \n%\n1,001\n \n914 \n \n9.5 \n%\nAdministrative expenses\n82\n \n88 \n(6.3)\n%\n251\n \n262 \n \n(4.1)\n%\nUnderwriting income\n607\n \n295 \n106.2 \n%\n116\n \n730 \n \n(84.1)\n%\nNet investment income\n123\n \n112 \n10.1 \n%\n361\n \n322 \n \n12.2 \n%\nOther (income) expense\n1\n \n1 \n— \n2\n \n— \nNM\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n2\n \n3 \n(5.4)\n%\n6\n \n7 \n(5.4)\n%\nSegment income\n$\n727\n \n$\n403 \n80.4 \n%\n$\n469\n \n$\n1,045 \n(55.1)\n%\nCombined ratio:\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n41.0\n \n%\n55.8 \n%\n(14.8)\npts\n72.6\n \n%\n58.2 \n%\n14.4 \npts\nPolicy acquisition cost ratio\n19.4\n \n%\n20.0 \n%\n(0.6)\npts\n20.1\n \n%\n20.0 \n%\n0.1 \npts\nAdministrative expense ratio\n4.7\n \n%\n5.5 \n%\n(0.8)\npts\n5.0\n \n%\n5.8 \n%\n(0.8)\npts\nCombined ratio\n65.1\n \n%\n81.3 \n%\n(16.2)\npts\n97.7\n \n%\n84.0 \n%\n13.7 \npts\nCatastrophe losses\n(9.2)\n%\n(14.6)\n%\n5.4 \npts\n(32.6)\n%\n(11.8)\n%\n(20.8)\npts\nPrior period development\n16.2\n \n%\n12.0 \n%\n4.2 \npts\n8.0\n \n%\n6.7 \n%\n1.3 \npts\nCAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses\n72.1\n \n%\n78.7 \n%\n(6.6)\npts\n73.1\n \n%\n78.9 \n%\n(5.8)\npts\nNM - Not meaningful\nNet Catastrophe Losses and Prior Period Development\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nSeptember 30\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet catastrophe losses\n$\n161\n \n$\n230 \n$\n1,645\n \n$\n538 \nFavorable prior period development\n$\n282\n \n$\n189 \n$\n403\n \n$\n305 \nRefer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on prior period development.\nPremiums\nNet premiums written increased $135 million, or 8.1 percent, and $393 million, or 8.0 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, driven by strong new business and retention, including positive rate and exposure increases in all lines.

Commercial lines growth reflects higher new business in property. Growth in Asia is also attributable to the acquisition of Liberty Mutual's P&C insurance business in Thailand effective April 1, 2025.\nLatin America increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting growth in personal lines business, including automobile in Mexico. Commercial lines increased driven by growth across all lines.\nNet premiums earned increased $382 million and $588 million, or $295 million and $693 million on a constant-dollar basis, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, reflecting the increase in net premiums written described above.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and higher favorable prior period development. The combined ratio decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting higher favorable prior period development, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting loss ratio improvement, primarily from commercial lines, offset by increase in expense ratio reflecting changes in mix of business, primarily higher consumer lines.\n64\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Reinsurance\nThe Global Reinsurance segment represents our reinsurance operations comprising Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda, Chubb Tempest Re USA, Chubb Tempest Re International, and Chubb Tempest Re Canada.

The decrease in net premiums written for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, also includes the impact of a large one-off structured transaction in the second quarter of 2024. \nNet premiums earned were relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and increased $71 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting the changes in net premiums written described above. Net premiums earned also includes the impact of new business written in the prior year for which premiums are earned in the current year.\n65\nTable of Contents\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. The combined ratio increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily reflecting higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development. \nThe CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was relatively flat as lower loss expectations in property and casualty lines was mostly offset by a lower proportion of net premiums earned from property lines which carry a lower loss and expense ratio. The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to lower loss expectations in property and casualty lines.\nLife Insurance\nThe Life Insurance segment comprises our international life operations, the life and asset management business of Huatai Group, Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance. \n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30\n% Change\nSeptember 30\n% Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2025\n2024\nQ-25 vs. Q-24\n2025\n2024\nYTD-25 vs. YTD-24\nNet premiums written\n$\n1,932\n \n$\n1,552 \n24.6 \n%\n$\n5,454\n \n$\n4,765 \n14.5 \n%\nNet premiums written - constant dollars\n23.5 \n%\n17.0 \n%\nNet premiums earned\n1,925\n \n1,530 \n25.8 \n%\n5,410\n \n4,709 \n14.9 \n%\nLosses and loss expenses\n31\n \n32 \n(3.1)\n%\n77\n \n86 \n(9.3)\n%\nPolicy benefits\n1,303\n \n989 \n31.7 \n%\n3,715\n \n3,090 \n20.2 \n%\nPolicy acquisition costs\n359\n \n291 \n23.5 \n%\n988\n \n885 \n11.6 \n%\nAdministrative expenses\n213\n \n213 \n— \n614\n \n638 \n(3.7)\n%\nNet investment income\n284\n \n250 \n13.7 \n%\n829\n \n738 \n12.3 \n%\nOther (income) expense\n(31)\n(39)\n(22.9)\n%\n(103)\n(111)\n(7.4)\n%\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n10\n \n10 \n— \n28\n \n31 \n(10.7)\n%\nSegment income\n$\n324\n \n$\n284 \n14.2 \n%\n$\n920\n \n$\n828 \n11.1 \n%\nSegment income - constant dollars\n13.9 \n%\n14.9 \n%\nPremiums\nNet premiums written increased $380 million and\n $689 million, or $367 million\n and $794 million\n on a\n constant-dollar basis, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\nFor our international life operations, net premiums written increased 26.5 percent and 14.4 percent, or 25.1 percent and 17.3 percent on a constant-dollar basis, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Underlying growth was primarily driven by strong new business in North Asia, notably in Huatai, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea. Growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, includes $126 million from a one-time large transaction in New Zealand.\nNet premiums written in our Combined Insurance business increased 18.1 percent and 17.6 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, or 18.1 percent and 18.3 percent on a constant-dollar basis, respectively, due to 29.8 percent and 33.6 percent growth in worksite business.\n66\nTable of Contents\nDeposits\nThe following table presents deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts:\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30\n% Change\nSeptember 30\n% Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2025\n2024\nC$\n2024\nQ-25 vs. Q-24\nC$\nQ-25 vs. Q-24\n2025\n2024\nC$ 2024\nY-25 vs. Y-24\nC$\n Y-25 vs.\nY-24\nDeposits collected on universal life and investment contracts\n$\n496\n \n$\n586 \n$\n619 \n(15.3)\n%\n(19.6)\n%\n$\n1,769\n \n$\n1,733 \n$\n1,741 \n2.0 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nDeposits collected on universal life and investment contracts (life deposits) are not reflected as revenues in our Consolidated statements of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Refer to Notes 11 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Market risk benefits gains (losses) and Other (income) expense, respectively.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)\nWe take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. The majority of our investment portfolio is available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nThe effect of market movements on our fixed maturities available-for-sale portfolio impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when we write down an asset, or when we record a change to the valuation allowance for expected credit losses. For a further discussion related to how we assess the valuation allowance for expected credit losses and the related impact on Net income, refer to Note 1 f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K. The effect of market movements on fixed maturities related to consolidated investment products and investments supporting certain participating products in the Huatai portfolio impact Net realized gains (losses). Additionally, Net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of public and private equity securities and derivatives, including financial futures, options, and swaps. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available-for-sale securities, resulting from the revaluation of securities held, changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, changes in current discount rate on future policy benefits, changes in instrument-specific credit risk on market risk benefits, unrealized postretirement benefit obligations liability adjustment, and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges for accounting purposes are reported as separate components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents our net realized and unrealized gains (losses):\nThree Months Ended September 30\n2025\n2024\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nNet\nRealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nUnrealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nImpact\nNet\nRealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nUnrealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nImpact\nFixed maturities \n$\n46\n \n$\n868\n \n$\n914\n \n$\n111 \n$\n3,459 \n$\n3,570 \nInvestment and embedded derivative instruments\n(85)\n—\n \n(85)\n66 \n— \n66 \nPublic equity\nSales\n59\n \n—\n \n59\n \n(6)\n— \n(6)\nMark-to-market\n337\n \n—\n \n337\n \n129 \n— \n129 \nPrivate equity (less than 3 percent ownership)\nMark-to-market\n48\n \n—\n \n48\n \n(41)\n— \n(41)\nTotal investment portfolio\n405\n \n868\n \n1,273\n \n259 \n3,459 \n3,718 \nOther derivative instruments\n(9)\n—\n \n(9)\n(2)\n— \n(2)\nForeign exchange\n(115)\n128\n \n13\n \n(58)\n445 \n387 \nCurrent discount rate on future policy benefits\n—\n \n305\n \n305\n \n— \n(672)\n(672)\nInstrument-specific credit risk on market risk benefits\n—\n \n(9)\n(9)\n— \n(8)\n(8)\nOther\n2\n \n(6)\n(4)\n(1)\n(19)\n(20)\nNet gains (losses), pre-tax\n$\n283\n \n$\n1,286\n \n$\n1,569\n \n$\n198 \n$\n3,205 \n$\n3,403 \n68\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30\n2025\n2024\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nNet\nRealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nUnrealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nImpact\nNet\nRealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nUnrealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nImpact\nFixed maturities \n$\n(58)\n$\n2,755\n \n$\n2,697\n \n$\n186 \n$\n2,293 \n$\n2,479 \nInvestment and embedded derivative instruments\n46\n \n—\n \n46\n \n6 \n— \n6 \nPublic equity\nSales\n79\n \n—\n \n79\n \n5 \n— \n5 \nMark-to-market\n517\n \n—\n \n517\n \n142 \n— \n142 \nPrivate equity (less than 3 percent ownership)\nMark-to-market\n31\n \n—\n \n31\n \n39 \n— \n39 \nTotal investment portfolio\n615\n \n2,755\n \n3,370\n \n378 \n2,293 \n2,671 \nOther derivative instruments\n(14)\n—\n \n(14)\n(7)\n— \n(7)\nForeign exchange\n(269)\n1,283\n \n1,014\n \n(162)\n(5)\n(167)\nCurrent discount rate on future policy benefits\n—\n \n53\n \n53\n \n— \n(672)\n(672)\nInstrument-specific credit risk on market risk benefits\n—\n \n(4)\n(4)\n— \n2 \n2 \nOther\n(5)\n(127)\n(132)\n(8)\n(17)\n(25)\nNet gains (losses), pre-tax\n$\n327\n \n$\n3,960\n \n$\n4,287\n \n$\n201 \n$\n1,601 \n$\n1,802 \nPre-tax net unrealized gains of $868 million and $2,755 million in our investment portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, were primarily driven by lower interest rates.\nPre-tax net realized gains of $283 million and $327 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, were primarily driven by mark-to-market gains on equity securities, partially offset by foreign exchange losses.\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate (ETR) reflects a mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between U.S. GAAP and local tax laws, and the impact of discrete items. A change in the geographic mix of earnings could impact our ETR.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, our ETR was 20.2 percent and 19.7 percent, respectively, compared to an ETR of 16.8 percent and 16.0 percent, respectively, in the prior year. The ETR for each period was impacted by our mix of earnings among various jurisdictions and by discrete tax items. \nThe ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, \nincluded an incremental deferred tax benefit of $55 million related to the Bermuda tax law enacted in December 2023.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nIn presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nWe provide financial measures, including net premiums written, net premiums earned, segment income, and underwriting income on a constant-dollar basis. We believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. The impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period.\n69\nTable of Contents\nP&C performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including Corporate) and exclude the operating results of the Life Insurance segment. We believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company’s P&C operations which are the most economically similar. We exclude the Life Insurance segment because the results of this business do not always correlate with the results of our P&C operations.\nP&C combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives. These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations.\nCAY P&C combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses (CATs) excludes CATs and prior period development (PPD) from the P&C combined ratio. We exclude CATs as they are not predictable as to timing and amount and PPD as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. The combined ratio numerator is adjusted to exclude CATs, PPD, and expense adjustments on PPD, and the denominator is adjusted to exclude net premiums earned adjustments on PPD and reinstatement premiums on CATs and PPD. In periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from PPD and net premiums earned when calculating the ratios. We believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our P&C business that may be obscured by these items. This measure is commonly reported among our peer companies and allows for a better comparison.\nReinstatement premiums are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. The reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted.\nNet premiums earned adjustments within PPD are adjustments to the initial premium earned on retrospectively rated policies based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. The premium adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies and are fully earned in the period the adjustments are recorded.\nPrior period expense adjustments typically relate to adjustable commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. The expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the calculation of combined ratio, as reported for each segment to P&C combined ratio, adjusted for CATs and PPD:\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance\nNorth America Personal P&C Insurance\nNorth America Agricultural Insurance\nOverseas General Insurance\nGlobal\nReinsurance\nCorporate\nTotal P&C\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\n(in millions of U.S. dollars except for ratios)\nNumerator\nLosses and loss expenses/policy benefits\nA\n$\n3,083\n \n$\n713\n \n$\n1,224\n \n$\n1,826\n \n$\n139\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n7,046\n \nCatastrophe losses and related adjustments\nCatastrophe losses, net of related adjustments\n(72)\n(161)\n(4)\n(42)\n(6)\n—\n \n(285)\nReinstatement premiums collected (expensed) on catastrophe losses\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCatastrophe losses, gross of related adjustments\n(72)\n(161)\n(4)\n(42)\n(6)\n—\n \n(285)\nPPD and related adjustments\nPPD, net of related adjustments - favorable (unfavorable)\n26\n \n282\n \n30\n \n84\n \n—\n \n(61)\n361\n \nNet premiums earned adjustments on PPD - unfavorable (favorable)\n68\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n68\n \nExpense adjustments - unfavorable (favorable)\n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \nPPD, gross of related adjustments - favorable (unfavorable)\n97\n \n282\n \n30\n \n84\n \n—\n \n(61)\n432\n \nCAY loss and loss expense ex CATs \nB\n$\n3,108\n \n$\n834\n \n$\n1,250\n \n$\n1,868\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7,193\n \nPolicy acquisition costs and administrative expenses\nPolicy acquisition costs and administrative expenses\nC\n$\n1,056\n \n$\n421\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n1,343\n \n$\n105\n \n$\n113\n \n$\n3,129\n \nExpense adjustments - favorable (unfavorable)\n(3)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(3)\nPolicy acquisition costs and administrative expenses, adjusted\nD\n$\n1,053\n \n$\n421\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n1,343\n \n$\n105\n \n$\n113\n \n$\n3,126\n \nDenominator\nNet premiums earned\nE\n$\n5,080\n \n$\n1,741\n \n$\n1,495\n \n$\n3,803\n \n$\n315\n \n$\n12,434\n \nNet premiums earned adjustments on PPD - unfavorable (favorable)\n68\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n68\n \nNet premiums earned excluding adjustments\nF\n$\n5,148\n \n$\n1,741\n \n$\n1,495\n \n$\n3,803\n \n$\n315\n \n$\n12,502\n \nP&C Combined ratio\nLoss and loss expense ratio\nA/E\n60.7\n \n%\n41.0\n \n%\n81.9\n \n%\n48.0\n \n%\n43.8\n \n%\n56.7\n \n%\nPolicy acquisition cost and administrative expense ratio\nC/E\n20.8\n \n%\n24.1\n \n%\n6.1\n \n%\n35.3\n \n%\n33.6\n \n%\n25.1\n \n%\nP&C Combined ratio\n81.5\n \n%\n65.1\n \n%\n88.0\n \n%\n83.3\n \n%\n77.4\n \n%\n81.8\n \n%\nCAY P&C Combined ratio ex CATs\nLoss and loss expense ratio, adjusted\nB/F\n60.4\n \n%\n48.0\n \n%\n83.6\n \n%\n49.1\n \n%\n42.0\n \n%\n57.5\n \n%\nPolicy acquisition cost and administrative expense ratio, adjusted\nD/F\n20.4\n \n%\n24.1\n \n%\n6.1\n \n%\n35.3\n \n%\n33.6\n \n%\n25.0\n \n%\nCAY P&C Combined ratio ex CATs\n80.8\n \n%\n72.1\n \n%\n89.7\n \n%\n84.4\n \n%\n75.6\n \n%\n82.5\n \n%\nCombined ratio\nCombined ratio\n81.7\n \n%\nAdd: impact of gains and losses on crop derivatives\n0.1\n \n%\nP&C Combined ratio\n81.8\n \n%\nNote: The ratios above are calculated using whole U.S. dollars.

Net investment income increased 9.3 percent and 9.4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, primarily due to higher average invested assets. Income from equity securities increased due to dividends from an investment fund that holds investment grade fixed income securities.\nFor private equities where we own less than three percent, investment income is included within Net investment income in the table above. For private equities where we own more than three percent, investment income is included within Other (income) expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. Excluded from Net investment income is the mark-to-market movement for private equities, which is recorded within either Other (income) expense or Net realized gains (losses) based on our percentage of ownership. The total mark-to-market movement for private equities excluded from Net investment income was as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30\nNine Months Ended September 30\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nTotal mark-to-market gain (loss) on private equity, pre-tax\n$\n(35)\n$\n170 \n$\n461\n \n$\n357 \nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $\n559\n million comprising $575 million related to fixed expense on existing debt obligations and variable expense, and a $16 million benefit relating to the amortization of the fair value of debt assumed in the Chubb Corp acquisition. The variable expenses relate to fees from the usage of certain facilities, including letters of credit, and interest on held collateral and repurchase agreements. Based on projected variable expenses and our existing debt obligations, including recent issuances of Chinese yuan renminbi term loans, bonds, and U.S. dollar senior notes, we expect pre-tax interest expense to be approximately $210 million for the remainder of 2025, or $785 million for the full year. We also expect a $5 million benefit related to the amortization of the fair value of debt assumed in the Chubb Corp acquisition for the remainder of 2025. For more information on our debt obligations, refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8 in our 2024 Form 10-K.\nInvestments\nOur investment portfolio is invested primarily in publicly traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of A/A as rated by the independent investment rating services Standard and Poor’s (S&P)/Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) at September 30, 2025. The portfolio is primarily managed externally by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. We hold no collateralized debt obligations in our \n75\nTable of Contents\ninvestment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. We have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. Exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our Global Credit Committee, comprising senior executives, including our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Investment Officer, and our Treasurer. We also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and clos\nely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines.\nThe following table shows the fair value and cost/amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our invested assets:\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nFair\nValue\nCost/\nAmortized\nCost, Net\nFair\nValue\nCost/\nAmortized\nCost, Net\nShort-term investments\n$\n4,380\n \n$\n4,381\n \n$\n5,142 \n$\n5,143 \nOther investments - Fixed maturities\n7,522\n \n7,522\n \n6,265 \n6,265 \nFixed maturities available-for-sale\n121,788\n \n123,676\n \n110,363 \n115,013 \nFixed income securities\n133,690\n \n135,579\n \n121,770 \n126,421 \nEquity securities \n10,377\n \n10,377\n \n9,151 \n9,151 \nPrivate debt held-for-investment\n2,566\n \n2,535\n \n2,680 \n2,628 \nPrivate equities and other\n19,394\n \n19,394\n \n17,101 \n17,101 \nTotal investments\n$\n166,027\n \n$\n167,885\n \n$\n150,702 \n$\n155,301 \nThe fair value of our total investments increased $15.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, mainly due to the investing of operating cash flow and gains in fixed maturities available-for-sale.

The average credit quality of our non-U.S. fixed income securities is A/A and 41 percent of our holdings are rated AAA or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. Within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. Issuer limits are based on credit rating (AA—two percent, A—one percent, BBB—0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. We manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating-based investment approach. Accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material.\n77\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our non-U.S. fixed income portfolio by country/sovereign for non-U.S. government securities at September 30, 2025:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost, Net\nRepublic of Korea\n$\n1,999\n \n$\n1,896\n \nPeople's Republic of China\n1,962\n \n1,981\n \nKingdom of Thailand\n1,089\n \n928\n \nCanada\n963\n \n975\n \nUnited Mexican States\n831\n \n828\n \nTaiwan\n774\n \n749\n \nFederative Republic of Brazil\n661\n \n671\n \nCommonwealth of Australia\n580\n \n650\n \nProvince of Hunan China\n558\n \n553\n \nProvince of Ontario\n557\n \n557\n \nOther Non-U.S. Government Securities\n8,475\n \n8,525\n \nTotal\n$\n18,449\n \n$\n18,313\n \nThe following table summarizes the fair value and amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our non-U.S. fixed income portfolio by country/sovereign for non-U.S. corporate securities at September 30, 2025:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost, Net\nChina\n$\n8,004\n \n$\n7,989\n \nUnited Kingdom\n2,763\n \n2,807\n \nCanada\n2,568\n \n2,542\n \nFrance\n1,755\n \n1,752\n \nUnited States \n(1)\n1,657\n \n1,658\n \nSouth Korea\n1,557\n \n1,485\n \nAustralia\n1,236\n \n1,254\n \nJapan\n990\n \n993\n \nGermany\n686\n \n701\n \nNetherlands\n586\n \n590\n \nOther Non-U.S. Corporate Securities\n7,602\n \n7,599\n \nTotal\n$\n29,404\n \n$\n29,370\n \n(1)     \nThe countries that are listed in the non-U.S. corporate fixed income portfolio above represent the ultimate parent company's country of risk. Non-U.S. corporate securities could be issued by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations.\nBelow-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio\nBelow-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. Below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. At September 30, 2025, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 15 percent of our fixed income portfolio. Our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,600 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $204 million.\nWe manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. The allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (BB/B). Our minimum rating for initial purchase is BB/B. Fifteen external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. Our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. Holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit \n78\nTable of Contents\nas a percentage of high-yield allocation. We monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. Derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nRefer to Item 7 in our 2024 Form 10-K for a description of our critical accounting estimates. Except as shown in the table below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2024. \nUnpaid losses and loss expenses\nAs an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and U.S. GAAP to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. With the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money.\n \nThe following table presents a roll-forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nGross\nLosses\nReinsurance\nRecoverable \n(1)\nNet\nLosses\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n84,004 \n$\n17,734 \n$\n66,270 \nLosses and loss expenses incurred\n25,142 \n4,723 \n20,419 \nLosses and loss expenses paid\n(22,020)\n(4,334)\n(17,686)\nOther (including foreign exchange translation)\n1,313 \n298 \n1,015 \nBalance at September 30, 2025\n$\n88,439 \n$\n18,421 \n$\n70,018 \n(1)\nNet of valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.\nThe estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. IBNR may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. Loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses).\nRefer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the changes in the loss reserves. \n79\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophe Management\nWe actively monitor and manage our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world from natural perils, which includes setting risk limits based on probable maximum loss (PML) and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to ensure sufficient liquidity and capital to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies, and policyholders, and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated, analytical catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. The table below presents our modeled pre-tax estimates of natural catastrophe PML, net of reinsurance, at September 30, 2025, and does not represent our expected catastrophe losses for any one year.\nModeled Net Probable Maximum Loss (PML) Pre-tax\n \nWorldwide \n(1)\nU.S. Hurricane \n(2)\nCalifornia Earthquake \n(3)\nAnnual Aggregate\nAnnual Aggregate\nSingle Occurrence\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\nChubb\n% of Total Chubb\nShareholders’\nEquity\nChubb\n% of Total Chubb\nShareholders’\nEquity\nChubb\n% of Total Chubb\nShareholders’\nEquity\n1-in-10\n$\n2,959 \n4.1 \n%\n$\n1,669 \n2.3 \n%\n$\n167 \n0.2 \n%\n1-in-100\n$\n5,727 \n8.0 \n%\n$\n3,904 \n5.4 \n%\n$\n1,864 \n2.6 \n%\n1-in-250\n$\n9,053 \n12.6 \n%\n$\n6,470 \n9.0 \n%\n$\n2,176 \n3.0 \n%\n(1)    \nWorldwide aggregate includes modeled losses arising from tropical cyclones, convective storms, earthquakes, wildfires, and inland floods, and excludes \"non-modeled\" perils such as man-made and other catastrophe risks including pandemic. \n(2)    \nU.S. hurricane modeled losses include losses from wind, storm-surge, and related precipitation-induced flooding.\n(3)    \nCalifornia earthquake modeled losses include the fire-following sub-peril.\nThe PML for worldwide and key U.S. peril regions are based on our in-force portfolio at July 1, 2025, and reflect the April 1, 2025, reinsurance program, as well as inuring reinsurance protection coverage. Refer to the Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance section for more information. These estimates assume that reinsurance recoverable is fully collectible.\nAccording to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our pre-tax annual aggregate losses incurred in any year from U.S. hurricane events could be in excess of $3,904 million (or 5.4 percent of total Chubb shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2025). \nThe above estimates of Chubb’s loss profile are inherently uncertain for many reasons, including the following:\n•\nWhile the use of third-party modeling packages to simulate potential catastrophe losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate catastrophe losses. In particular, modeled catastrophe events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential;\n•\nThere is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models, the running of the modeling software, and interpretation of loss output. These loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates;\n•\nThe potential effects of climate change add to modeling complexity; and\n•\nChanging climate conditions could impact our exposure to natural catastrophe risks. Published studies by leading government, academic, and professional organizations combined with extensive research by Chubb climate scientists reveal the potential for increases in the frequency and severity of key natural perils such as tropical cyclones, inland flood, and wildfire. To understand the potential impacts on the Chubb portfolio, we have conducted stress tests on our peak exposure zone, namely in the U.S., using parameters outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Climate Change 2021 report. These parameters consider the impacts of climate change and the resulting climate peril impacts over a timescale relevant to our business. The tests are conducted by adjusting our baseline view of risk for the perils of hurricane, inland flood, and wildfire in the U.S. to reflect increases in frequency and severity across the modeled domains for each of these perils. Based on these tests against the Chubb portfolio we do not expect material impacts to our baseline PMLs from climate change through December 31, 2025. These tests reflect current exposures only and exclude potentially mitigating factors such as changes to building codes, public or private risk mitigation, regulation, and public policy.\nRefer to Item 7 in our 2024 Form 10-K for more information on man-made and other catastrophes.\n80\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program\nChubb’s core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our Global Reinsurance and Life Insurance segments).\nWe regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. This may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program’s renewal date. In addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled PML assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations.\nChubb renewed its Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program for our North American and International operations effective April 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026. The program consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by Chubb on a per occurrence basis. Chubb renewed its terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the United States from April 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026, with the same limits, retention, and percentage placed except that the terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement. \nLoss Location\nLayer of Loss\nComments\nNotes\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$0 million \n–\n \n$1.75 billion\nLosses retained by Chubb\n(a)\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$1.75 billion \n–\n$2.85 billion \nAll natural perils and terrorism \n(b)\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$2.85 billion \n–\n$4.0 billion\nAll natural perils and terrorism \n(c)\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$4.0 billion –\n$5.7 billion\nNamed windstorm and earthquake\nInternational \n(including Alaska and Hawaii)\n$0 million \n–\n$225 million\nLosses retained by Chubb\n(a)\nInternational \n(including Alaska and Hawaii)\n$225 million \n–\n$1.325 billion\nAll natural perils and terrorism \n(b)\nAlaska, Hawaii, and Canada\n$1.325 billion \n–\n$2.475 billion\nAll natural perils and terrorism\n(c)\n(a)    \nUltimate retention will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other catastrophe programs purchased by individual business units.

The repurchase agreements are collateralized borrowings where we maintain the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice, unlike short-term debt which comprises the current maturities of our long-term debt instruments.\nChubb INA Holdings LLC (Chubb INA) completed the following debt transactions in 2025:\n•\nMarch 2025: Repaid $800 million of 3.15 percent senior notes upon maturity.\n•\nApril 2025: Entered into a 1.8 billion Chinese yuan (CNY) term loan (approximately $249 million at the time of issuance) at 2.85 percent, due April 10, 2028.\n•\nJuly 2025: Entered into a 2.1 billion CNY term loan (approximately $299 million at the time of issuance) at 2.75 percent, due July 25, 2028.\n•\nAugust 2025: Issued 4.5 billion CNY bonds (approximately $627 million at the time of issuance) in 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year tranches, with interest rates ranging from 2.50 percent to 3.05 percent.\n•\nAugust 2025: Issued $1.25 billion of 4.90 percent senior notes due August 2035.\nRefer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased $2.3 billion of Common Shares in a series of open market transactions under the Board of Directors (Board) share repurchase authorization. At September 30, 2025, there were 17,782,983 Common Shares in treasury with a weighted-average cost of $207.06 per share. In May 2025, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Chubb's Common Shares effective July 1, 2025 with no expiration date. For the period October 1, 2025, through October 24, 2025, we repurchased 1,000,000 Common Shares for a total of $282 million in a series of open market transactions under the share repurchase authorization. At October 27, 2025, $3.5 billion in share repurchase authorization remained.\nWe generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shelf registration statement which is renewed every three years. This allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs.\nDividends\nWe have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. Under Swiss law, dividends must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our dividend methodology. \n82\nTable of Contents\nAt our May 2025 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.88 per share, or CHF 3.24 per share, calculated using the USD/CHF exchange rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on May 15, 2025, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.97 per share after the general meeting by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board determines the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2026 annual general meeting and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. The annual dividend approved in May 2025 represented a $0.24 per share increase ($0.06 per quarter) over the prior year dividend.\nThe following table represents dividends paid per Common Share to shareholders of record on each of the following dates:\n \nShareholders of record as of:\nDividends paid as of:\n \nDecember 13, 2024\nJanuary 3, 2025\n$0.91 (CHF 0.80)\nMarch 14, 2025\nApril 4, 2025\n$0.91 (CHF 0.81)\nJune 13, 2025\nJuly 3, 2025\n$0.97 (CHF 0.81)\nSeptember 12, 2025\nOctober 3, 2025\n$0.97 (CHF 0.78)\nLiquidity\nWe anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. In addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. The programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. Should the need arise, we generally have access to the long-term capital markets, credit facilities, and commercial paper. \nOur group syndicated credit facility has capacity of $3.0 billion and expires in October 2027. Our total letter of credit capacity is $4.1 billion, $3.0 billion of which can be used for revolving credit. At September 30, 2025, our usage under these facilities was $944 million in letters of credit. Our access to credit under these facilities is dependent on the ability of the bank counterparties to meet their funding commitments. The facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which we met at September 30, 2025. Should the existing credit providers on these facilities experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility or establishing additional facilities when needed. \nWe have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion in commercial paper, supported by the $3.0 billion group syndicated credit facility. At September 30, 2025, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThe payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we were able to meet all our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our Common Shares, with our net cash flows.\nWe assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary’s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. Chubb Limited received dividends of $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion from its Bermuda subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. Chubb Limited received dividends of $207 million and $91 million from its other international subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Chubb Limited received $2.25 billion from Chubb INA for the redemption of a portion of its ownership interest in Chubb INA, in accordance with the plan of liquidation and conversion of Chubb INA to a limited liability company. Chubb INA is expected to fully redeem, by the end of 2027, Chubb Limited's 20 percent ownership interest in Chubb INA. \nThe U.S. insurance subsidiaries of Chubb INA may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary’s domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). Chubb INA’s international subsidiaries are \n83\nTable of Contents\nalso subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. Chubb Limited received no dividends from Chubb INA during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024. Debt issued by Chubb INA is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by Chubb INA’s insurance subsidiaries to Chubb INA as well as other group resources. Chubb INA received dividends of $1.8 billion from its subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024.\nCash Flows\nOur sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nOperating cash flows were $8.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $11.6 billion in the prior year period, primarily due to higher net losses and income taxes paid, partially offset by higher premiums collected and higher net investment income.\nCash used for investing was $8.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $11.4 billion in the prior year period, a decrease of $2.5 billion, primarily due to lower net purchases of fixed maturities, equity, and short-term securities of $3.4 billion. This activity was partially offset by the impact of net private equity contributions of $1.1 billion in the current year compared to net private equity distributions of $311 million received in the prior year period.\nCash used for financing was $189 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $62 million in the prior year period, an increase of $127 million. This was primarily due to \nhigher common share repurchases of $1.2 billion, lower net policyholder deposits of $65 million, and lower proceeds from employee share-based compensation plans of $92 million,\n partially offset by higher net third-party capital invested into consolidated investment products of $757 million and higher repurchase agreement borrowings of $469 million. \nWe use repurchase agreements as a low-cost alternative source of liquidity within our operating subsidiaries. At September 30, 2025, there were $3.4 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next eight months.\nBoth internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss.\n84\nTable of Contents\nInformation provided in connection with outstanding debt of subsidiaries\nChubb INA Holdings LLC (Subsidiary Issuer) is an indirect 100 percent-owned and consolidated subsidiary of Chubb Limited (Parent Guarantor).
