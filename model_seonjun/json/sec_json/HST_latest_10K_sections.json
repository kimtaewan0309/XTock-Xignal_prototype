  "item1": "Item 1. Business\nWe are the largest publicly traded lodging REIT, with a geographically diverse portfolio of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 21, 2025, our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 81 primarily luxury and upper-upscale hotels containing approximately 43,400 rooms, with substantially all located in the United States (five of the hotels are located outside of the U.S. in Brazil and Canada). In addition, we own non-controlling interests in seven domestic and one international joint ventures that focus on the lodging industry, see \" - Other Real Estate Interests\" for a further description.\nHost Inc. was incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT. Host Inc. owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of the partnership interests (“OP units”) as of December 31, 2024. The remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal is to be the preeminent owner of high-quality lodging real estate in growing markets in the U.S. and to generate superior long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders throughout all phases of the lodging cycle through a combination of appreciation in asset values, growth in earnings and the payment of dividends. The pillars of our strategy to achieve this objective and elevate our growth profile include:\n•\nGeographically diverse portfolio of hotels in the\n U.S. - Own a diversified portfolio of hotels in the U.S. in major urban and resort destinations. Target markets with diverse demand generators, high barriers to entry, favorable supply and demand dynamics and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth;\n1\nTable of Contents\n•\nStrong scale and integrated platform\n - Utilize our scale to create value through enterprise analytics, asset management and capital investment initiatives, while aiding external growth by leveraging scale as a competitive advantage to acquire assets befitting our strategy. Allocate and recycle capital to seek returns that exceed our cost of capital and actively return capital to stockholders; \n•\nInvestment grade balance sheet\n - Maintain a strong and flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout all phases of the lodging cycle; and\n•\nEmployer of choice and responsible corporate citizen\n - Align our organizational structure with our business objectives to be an employer of choice and a responsible corporate citizen.\nGeographically Diverse Portfolio\n \nWe seek to have a geographically diversified portfolio in major markets and premier resort destinations in the U.S. We primarily focus on acquisitions and, occasionally, new development opportunities to enhance our portfolio. While we have historically targeted acquisitions in the top 25 U.S. markets, we also consider hotels in other markets, which we believe have high growth potential and diverse demand generators. We focus generally on the following types of assets:\n•\nResorts\n in destination locations with limited supply growth. These assets feature superior amenities and unique experiential offerings; \n•\nConvention destination hotels\n that are group oriented in urban and resort markets. These assets feature extensive and high-quality meeting facilities and often are connected to prominent convention centers; and\n•\nHigh-end urban hotels\n that are positioned in prime locations and possess multiple demand drivers for both business and leisure travelers.\nAs one of the largest owners of Marriott and Hyatt hotels, our hotels primarily are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Within these brands, we have focused predominantly on the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, as we believe these have a broad appeal for both individual and group leisure and business customers. In addition, we own several unbranded or soft-branded hotels that appeal to distinctive customer profiles in certain submarkets. \nStrong Scale and Integrated Platform\n \nEnterprise Analytics Platform. \nDue to the scale of our asset management and business intelligence platform, we believe we are in a unique position to implement value-added real estate decisions and to assist our managers in improving operating performance and profitability. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow our enterprise analytics team to benchmark similar hotels and identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and cost efficiencies that can maximize the operating performance, long-term profitability and value of our real estate. We perform independent underwriting of return on investment (“ROI”) projects and potential acquisitions, as well as revenue management analysis of ancillary revenue opportunities. Our goal is to continue to differentiate our hotels within their competitive markets, drive operating performance and enhance the overall value of our real estate through the following: \n•\nEnhance operating performance and profitability by using our business intelligence system to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls.\n•\nDrive revenue growth by conducting detailed strategic reviews with our managers on markets and business mix to assist them in developing the appropriate group/transient mix, online presence to address a broad customer base, and market share targets for each hotel. \n•\nWork with leading brands, such as Marriott and Hyatt, to take advantage of their worldwide presence and lodging infrastructure. We also have a selection of hotels managed by independent operators where we believe these operators have more flexibility to drive revenues and control costs to maximize profits. \n2\nTable of Contents\n•\nImprove asset value through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements to increase contract flexibility. \nDisciplined Capital Allocation. \nGuided by a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are equipped to make investment decisions that seek to deliver the greatest value and returns to stockholders. Our goal is to allocate capital to enhance and improve our portfolio, while balancing the importance of prudently returning capital to stockholders. \nFor 2025, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation and intend to take advantage of our strong balance sheet and overall scale. We are constantly evaluating potential acquisitions of iconic upper-upscale and luxury properties that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages. Similarly, we intend to continue our capital recycling program with strategic and opportunistic dispositions. This may include the sale of assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or hotels with significant capital expenditure requirements that we do not believe would generate an adequate return.\nWe may acquire additional properties or dispose of properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders. We anticipate that any acquisitions may be funded by, or through a combination of, proceeds from the sales of hotels, equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility. We note, however, that the nature and supply of these assets make acquisitions inherently difficult to predict. For these reasons, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in purchasing any one or more hotels that we are reviewing currently, or may in the future review, bid on or negotiate to buy.\nWe also seek to create\n \nand mine value from our existing portfolio through value enhancement initiatives and ROI projects. We believe these investments provide a significant opportunity to achieve returns well in excess of our cost of capital. We work closely with our managers to attempt to schedule these projects to minimize operational disruption and environmental impact. Value enhancement initiatives seek to maximize the value of real estate within our existing portfolio through its highest and best use. These projects may include hotel expansion, timeshare, office space or condominium units on excess land, redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space, and the acquisition of development entitlements. ROI projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set. These projects include extensive renovations, including guest rooms, lobbies, food and beverage outlets; expansions and/or extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms; major mechanical system upgrades; and green building initiatives and certifications. Also included are projects focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs, such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space, adding guestrooms, and implementing energy and water conservation measures such as LED lighting, high-efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment and fixtures, solar power, energy management systems, guestroom water efficient fixtures, and building automation systems. \nRenewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels. Typically, renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven to ten years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property, function of area being renovated, hotel occupancy and other factors. These renovations generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods, bathroom and architectural and engineering systems. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, textiles and wall finishes, which may require more frequent updates to maintain brand quality standards. Case goods include dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room tables and chairs, which generally are not replaced as frequently. Bathroom renovations include the refurbishment or replacement of tile, vanity, lighting and plumbing fixtures. Architectural and engineering systems include the physical plant of the hotel, including the roof, elevators/escalators, façade, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and fire systems. We also execute capital expenditure projects to further increase the resilience of our hotels, including replacements and restorations of exterior walls, doors and windows, roofs, grounds, relocated/elevated critical equipment and distributed energy systems. \nThroughout the lodging cycle, to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities that meet our return requirements, we will focus on returning capital to stockholders through dividends or common stock repurchases. Significant factors we review to determine the level and timing of the returns to stockholders include our current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets, current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales. \nInvestment Grade Balance Sheet\n \nOur goal is to maintain a flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout the lodging cycle. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (other than net \n3\nTable of Contents\ncapital gain) to its stockholders each year and, as a result, generally relies on external sources of capital, as well as cash from operations, to finance growth. \nManagement believes that a\n \nstrong balance sheet\n \nis a key competitive advantage that affords us a lower cost of debt and positions us for external growth. While we may issue debt at any time, we will target a net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio, (or “Leverage Ratio,” as defined in our credit facility) that allows us to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. We believe an investment grade rating will give us the most consistent access to capital throughout the business cycle. \nWe seek to structure our debt profile to\n \nmaintain financial flexibility and a staggered maturity schedule\n \nwith access to different forms of financing, consisting primarily of senior notes and exchangeable debentures, as well as mortgage debt. Generally, we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt, minimize near-term maturities and maintain a staggered maturity schedule. Depending on market conditions, we also may utilize variable rate debt which can provide greater protection during a decline in the lodging industry.  \nCorporate Responsibility\n \nWe are committed to creating long-term value through investing responsibly in our business, environment, people and community. Our Corporate Responsibility (\"CR\") program is centered around the concept of responsible investment—an overarching strategy that guides our focus and actions across our three main themes of Environmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility and Governance.\nWe believe that a disciplined and proactive approach to addressing critical environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics enables us to create long-term value for our stockholders and helps us to optimize our portfolio and human capital investments, while maintaining our position as a global sustainability leader. Our management approach is driven by people, culture, policies, targets and performance monitoring to improve the value from our investments of time, talent and financial resources. This approach directly supports Host’s business strategy and goals.   \n•\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n: We are investing in solutions that conserve and restore natural capital to assist us in mitigating climate change and biodiversity impacts with the goal of achieving best-in-class returns.\n•\nSocial Responsibility\n: We are committed to advancing health, well-being and opportunity for all of our stakeholders, including investors, employees, partners and communities.\n•\nGovernance\n: Our responsible investment strategies are guided by executive and board-level oversight, our EPIC values of Excellence, Partnership, Integrity and Community, our ethical standards, and a disciplined approach to risk management and sustainable value creation.\nThe Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) (now maintained by the International Sustainability Standards Board under the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) outlines the disclosure topics and accounting metrics for the real estate industry. The energy and water management metrics that best correlate with our industry include total energy consumed (“Total Energy Consumption”) and total water withdrawn (“Total Water Consumption”). The energy and water data we use is collected and reviewed by third parties who compile the data from property utility statements. \nThe charts below detail our third-party verified Total Energy Consumption and Total Water Consumption for 2021 through 2023, the last three fiscal years for which data is available\n(1)\n. The increase in Total Water Consumption from 2022 to 2023 reflects an increase in occupancy at our hotels, while Total Energy Consumption remained level due to efficiency investments. The increases in both Total Water Consumption and Total Energy Consumption from 2021 to 2022 reflect the recovery of business at our hotels following the COVID-19 pandemic:\n4\nTable of Contents\n___________\n(1)\nEnergy and water metrics relate to our consolidated hotels owned for the entire year presented. \nOur latest Corporate Responsibility Report, which was issued in July 2024, details our CR program and responsible investment strategy; along with our environmental, social and governance performance and our 2030 environmental and social targets that serve as the interim milestone in our roadmap to achieve our aspirational vision of becoming a net positive company by 2050. The Corporate Responsibility Report also includes Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and full SASB disclosures, as well as an EEO-1 report. The contents of our Corporate Responsibility Report are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and do not form a part of this Form 10-K.  \nThe Lodging Industry \nThe lodging industry in the United States consists of private and public entities that operate in a diversified market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants: \n•\nOwners\n—own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel. These hotels may be branded and operated under the manager’s brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager. The hotels also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager. \n•\nOwner/Managers\n—own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team. These hotels may be branded under a franchise agreement, operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owner’s brand. We are prohibited from operating and managing hotels by applicable REIT rules. \n•\nFranchisors\n—own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system. Franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels. \n•\nFranchisor/Managers\n—own a brand or brands and operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee. \n•\nManagers\n—operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner, but do not, themselves, own a brand. The hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel. \nThe hotel manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the hotel, including the employment of hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditures budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner. The hotel manager typically receives fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel. \nSupply and Demand.\n Our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy, in addition to local \n5\nTable of Contents\nmarket factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations. Trends in economic indicators such as gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth, business investment, corporate profits and employment growth are key indicators of the relative strength of lodging demand. Lodging demand also will be affected by changes to international travel patterns. \nLodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand, as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development. However, the rate of supply growth also is influenced by several additional factors, including the availability of capital, interest rates, construction costs and unique market considerations. The relatively long lead-time required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry, as new supply may be planned during an upcycle but may open for business in a weaker economy. Therefore, as illustrated in the charts below for the U.S. lodging industry, at different points in the cycle, demand growth may accelerate when supply growth is very low, or supply may accelerate while demand growth is slowing. Online short-term rentals are a source of non-traditional supply for the industry, in both urban and resort destinations, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings and vacation homes. Though not reported through official industry statistics, the impact on the hotel industry and the availability of these outlets is more variable than typical changes in supply from hotel construction and tends to be very market specific. Local legislation has the potential to limit supply growth for these online short-term rentals in many top markets, though the growth of professional management for legal rentals remains a key trend.  \nOur portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale and luxury hotels and, accordingly, its performance is best understood in comparison to the luxury and upper upscale categories rather than the entire industry. The charts below detail the historical supply, demand and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) growth for the U.S. lodging industry and for the U.S. luxury and upper upscale categories for 2019 to 2024. \nU.S. Lodging Industry Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth\n6\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Luxury and Upper Upscale Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth \nOur Customers.\n \nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows: \nTransient business broadly represents individual business and/or leisure travelers. Our hotels attract both business and leisure travelers; therefore, our hotels' performance as it relates to transient demand is driven by trends related to both of these customer types. The four key subcategories of rates offered to the transient business group are: \n•\nRetail:\n This is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the public. It typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates. It includes the “rack rate,” which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. Retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g., seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays). \n•\nNon-Qualified Discount:\n This category includes special rates offered by the hotels, including packages, advance-purchase discounts and promotional offers. It also includes rooms booked through online travel agencies (OTAs). \n•\nSpecial Corporate\n: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. These rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate. In addition, this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel.\n•\nQualified Discount\n: This category encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel. \nGroup business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are: \n•\nAssociation\n: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions. \n•\nCorporate\n: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations). \n•\nOther\n: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as SMERF business. \n7\nTable of Contents\nContract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period at significantly discounted rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels. Contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand.\nManagers and Operational Agreements\nAll our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements, with some of such hotels also subject to separate franchise or license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operations under the designated brand. Under these agreements, the managers have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, securing and processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers employ all managerial and other employees for the hotels, review hotel operations with a focus on improving revenues and managing expenses, review the maintenance of the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. These support services include planning and policy services, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management and certain in-house legal services. We have certain approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters. \nGeneral Terms and Provisions\n – Agreements governing our hotels that are managed by brand owners (Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, Four Seasons, 1 Hotels and AccorHotels) typically include the terms described below: \n•\nTerm and fees for operational services\n. The initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 10 to 25 years, with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager. The majority of our management agreements condition the manager’s right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria. The manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (generally 2-3%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which typically is calculated as a percentage (generally 10-20%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel. In the case of our hotels operating under the W\n®\n, Westin\n®\n, Luxury Collection\n®\n and St. Regis\n®\n brands and managed by Marriott following its acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. on September 23, 2016 (collectively, the “Starwood Hotels”), the base management fee is only 1% of annual gross revenues, but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable under a separate license agreement (as described below). \n•\nLicense services\n. In the case of the Starwood Hotels, operations are governed by separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand, including rights to use trademarks, service marks and logos, matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies, and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services. Although the term of these license agreements generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements, the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement (for instance, in the event the hotel is operated by an independent operator). Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees (generally 5% of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2% of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales), which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1% of gross revenues received by Marriott under the operating agreements, as noted above. \n•\nChain or system programs and services\n. Managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis. Such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services, regional or other centralized management and administrative services, marketing and sales programs and services, training and other personnel services, and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized, regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services. \n•\nWorking capital and fixed asset supplies\n. We are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies (for example, linen, china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the \n8\nTable of Contents\nfunds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels. For certain hotels, the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis, with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements. \n•\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment replacements\n. We are required to provide the managers with all furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) necessary for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required FF&E replacements). On an annual basis, the managers prepare budgets for FF&E to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds, which budgets are subject to our review and approval. For purposes of funding such expenditures, a specified percentage (typically 4-5%) of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name, to which the manager has access. For certain hotels, we have negotiated flexibility with the manager that reduces the funding commitment required as follows: \n◦\nFor certain of our Marriott-managed hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account, rather than periodic reserve fund contributions being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each of the subject hotels, with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly less than the amount that would have been maintained otherwise in such separate hotel reserve accounts. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded (either by the purchaser or by us, as the seller) in the full amount of the reserve balance associated with the subject hotel.\n◦\nFor certain of the Starwood Hotels, periodic reserve fund contributions, which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers at each hotel, are distributed to us and we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded in the amount of the subject hotel’s pro rata share, if any, of the consolidated pooled reserve balance.\n•\nBuilding alterations, improvements and renewals\n. The managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel, along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in the manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards. We generally have approval rights over such budgets and expenditures, which we review and approve based on our manager’s recommendations and on our judgment. Expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners, although our agreements with Marriott in respect of the Starwood Hotels contemplate that certain such expenditures also may be funded from the FF&E reserve account. \n•\nTreatment of additional owner funding\n. As additional owner funding becomes necessary, either for expenditures generally funded from the FF&E replacement funds, or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners, most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers. One approach frequently utilized at some of our Marriott-managed hotels (excluding the Starwood Hotels) is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid, with interest, from operational revenues, with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees. Another approach that is used at the Starwood Hotels, as well as with certain capital expenditures projects at some of our other hotels, is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel, resulting in an increase to the owner’s priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees. For the hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above, the amount of any additional FF&E reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis, determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year. \n9\nTable of Contents\n•\nTerritorial protections\n. Certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning, operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area. The area restrictions vary with each hotel, from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multi-mile radius from the hotel in other areas. \n•\nSale of the hotel\n. Subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels (see below under “Special Termination Rights”), we generally are limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer such hotels by the requirement that the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager. \n•\nPerformance Termination Rights. \nIn addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager, most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights for us to terminate on the basis of the manager’s failure to meet certain performance-based metrics, typically including a specified threshold return on the owner’s investment in the hotel, along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified RevPAR performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market. Typically, such performance-based termination rights arise in the event the manager fails to achieve these specified performance thresholds over a consecutive two-year period and are subject to the manager’s ability to “cure” and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts (or, in some instances, waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees). We have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates, which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements. \n•\nSpecial Termination Rights.\n In addition to any performance-based or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements, we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements. While the brand affiliation of a hotel may increase its value, the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement, or even brand affiliation, also can increase the value for prospective purchasers. These termination rights can take several different forms, including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement; termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation; or termination without sale or other conditions, which may require the payment of a fee.  \nIn addition to hotels managed by brand owners, we have both branded hotels and non-branded hotels operated by independent managers. Our management agreements with independent managers, while similar in operational scope to agreements with our brand managers, typically have shorter initial terms, no renewal rights, more flexible termination rights, and more limited system-wide services. However, while we have additional flexibility with respect to these operators, certain of those hotels remain subject to underlying franchise or licensing agreements. These franchise or licensing agreements allow us to engage independent managers to operate our hotels under the applicable brand names and to participate in the brands’ reservation and loyalty-rewards systems. Under these agreements, we pay the brand owners a franchise or licensing fee equal to a specified percentage of gross room revenues, as well as other system fees and reimbursements. In addition, we are obligated to maintain applicable brand standards at our franchised hotels. \nOperating Structure \nHost Inc. operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all its assets are owned by Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and holds approximately 99% of the OP units as of December 31, 2024. A REIT is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that meets certain ownership, organizational and operating requirements set forth under the Code. In general, by payments of dividends to stockholders, a REIT is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Each OP unit owned by unaffiliated limited partners other than Host Inc. is redeemable, at the option of the limited partner, for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of Host Inc. common stock multiplied by the current conversion factor of 1.021494. Host Inc. has the right to acquire any OP unit offered for redemption directly from the limited partner in exchange for 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock instead of Host L.P. redeeming such OP unit for cash. Additionally, for every share of common stock issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue 0.97895 OP units to Host Inc. in exchange for the consideration received from the issuance of the common stock. As of December 31, 2024, unaffiliated limited partners owned 9.2 million OP units, which were convertible into 9.4 million Host Inc. common shares. \n10\nTable of Contents\nAssuming that all OP units held by unaffiliated limited partners were converted into common shares, there would have been 708.5 million common shares of Host Inc. outstanding at December 31, 2024. \nOur operating structure is as follows:\n \nAs a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of “non-qualifying” income that Host Inc. and Host L.P. can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all our consolidated hotels to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes. Our TRS are subject to federal and state corporate income tax and are not limited as to the amount of non-qualifying income they can generate, but they are limited in terms of their value as a percentage of the total value of our assets. Our TRS enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels. Our TRS also may own assets engaging in activities that produce non-qualifying income, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units and the generation of asset management fees, subject to certain restrictions. The difference between the hotels’ net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to Host L.P. is retained or incurred by our TRS as taxable income or loss. Accordingly, the net effect of the TRS leases is that a portion of the net operating cash flow from our hotels is subject to federal, state and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax. \nOur Consolidated Hotel Portfolio \nAs of February 21, 2025, we owned a portfolio of 81 hotels, of which 76 are in the United States and five are located in Brazil and Canada. Our consolidated hotels located outside the United States collectively have approximately 1,500 rooms. Approximately 2% of our revenues in 2024, 2% of our revenues in 2023 and 1% of our revenues in 2022 were attributed to the operations of these five foreign hotels.\nThe lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. Our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties, which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as Marriott, Westin, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Four Seasons and Hilton. Our portfolio also includes hotels referred to as “soft-branded” that are associated with a major brand chain, but maintain a unique identity that is customized towards a particular customer profile or authentic location. \nRevenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories: rooms, food and beverage, and other revenues. While approximately 60% of our revenues in 2024 were generated from rooms sales, the majority of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability. Our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities, a variety of restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and/or spas, gift shops and parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers.  \nOur consolidated portfolio includes 29 hotels that have more than 500 rooms. The average age of our properties is 37 years, although substantially all of them have benefited from significant renovations or major additions, as well as \n11\nTable of Contents\nregularly scheduled renewal and replacement expenditures and other capital improvements. In our consolidated portfolio, approximately 88% of our hotels, by room count, are managed by their own brand managers, and 12% are managed by independent managers as a franchise or as an independent brand.\nBy Brand. \nThe following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of February 21, 2025:\nBrand\nNumber\nof Hotels\nRooms\nPercentage\nof Revenues \n⁽¹⁾ \nMarriott:\nMarriott\n26\n19,038\n36.8 \n%\nRitz-Carlton\n6\n2,367\n10.2 \n%\nAutograph Collection\n1\n223\n0.3 \n%\nTribute Portfolio\n1\n173\n0.4 \n%\nJW Marriott\n4\n1,909\n3.5 \n%\nAC Hotels\n1\n165\n0.2 \n%\nW\n1\n424\n0.6 \n%\nSt. Regis\n1\n232\n0.4 \n%\nLuxury Collection\n1\n645\n3.5 \n%\nWestin\n8\n3,972\n7.7 \n%\nSheraton\n1\n370\n0.4 \n%\nTotal Marriott\n51\n29,518\n64.0 \n%\nHyatt:\nAlila\n1\n59\n0.7 \n%\nAndaz\n1\n320\n1.7 \n%\nGrand Hyatt\n4\n3,638\n7.0 \n%\nHyatt Place\n1\n426\n0.7 \n%\nHyatt Regency\n6\n3,866\n7.5 \n%\nTotal Hyatt\n13\n8,309\n17.6 \n%\nHilton:\nCurio\n2\n591\n1.6 \n%\nHilton\n1\n223\n0.2 \n%\nEmbassy Suites\n2\n961\n1.5 \n%\nTotal Hilton\n5\n1,775\n3.3 \n%\nAccorHotels:\nSwissôtel \n1\n662\n1.0 \n%\nFairmont\n1\n450\n2.3 \n%\nibis\n1\n256\n0.1 \n%\nNovotel\n1\n149\n0.1 \n%\nTotal AccorHotels\n4\n1,517\n3.5 \n%\n1 Hotel\n3\n882\n4.7 \n%\nFour Seasons\n2\n569\n4.8 \n%\nOther/Independent\n3\n819\n2.1 \n%\n \n81\n43,389\n100.0 \n%\n___________\n(1)\nBased on our 2024 revenues; no individual hotel contributed more than 6% of total revenues in 2024.

The following chart summarizes the composition of our consolidated hotels as of February 21, 2025 by each market location based on its percentage of 2024 revenues: \nOther Real Estate Interests \nWe own non-controlling interests in several entities that, as of February 21, 2025, owned, or owned an interest in, 40 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the ownership structure and economic or participating rights of our partners, we do not consolidate the operations of the properties owned by these entities and they are included in equity in earnings in our consolidated results of operations. Our investments in these entities include the following: \nNoble Joint Venture. \nWhile our primary focus is the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, we also seek opportunities to elevate our growth profile through investment in select service hotels, extended stay hotels and new development deals. Accordingly, in 2022, we entered into definitive agreements with Noble Investment Group, LLC, a leading private hospitality asset manager in the upscale, select service and extended stay chain scales, and certain other entities and persons related to Noble Investment Group, LLC, to acquire a minority equity interest in Noble Management Holdings, LLC and Noble Investment Holdings, LLC representing 49% of (a) the net fee income of the Noble Investment Group business in respect of existing and future Noble Investment Group funds and other revenue-based activities, (b) 40% of the gross carried interest earned on the funds formed after closing, and (c) proceeds earned by the general partner on  commitments to future funds. As part of our investment, we have made a $211.5 million capital commitment to Noble Hospitality Fund V, L.P. (\"Noble Fund V\"), which represents a 21.15% ownership interest in the fund. As of December 31, 2024, we have funded $72 million to Noble Fund V. Additionally, through a co-investment of the fund, we have committed an additional $30 million of which we have funded $13 million. Noble Fund V and the co-investment currently own 30 select service and extended stay hotels and ten land sites to be developed.\nBeginning in 2026, upon certain triggers being met, we have the ability to acquire up to 100% of Noble Management Holdings, LLC and Noble Investment Holdings, LLC. To the extent certain triggers are met and we have not exercised our call right, Noble Investment Group, LLC has a one-time ability, but not the obligation, to exercise its put \n15\nTable of Contents\nright to cause us to purchase up to an additional 26% of Noble Management Holdings, LLC and Noble Investment Holdings, LLC.\nMaui Joint Venture. \nWe own a 67% interest in a joint venture with an affiliate of HV Global Group, a subsidiary of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, that owns a 131-unit vacation ownership development in Maui, Hawaii adjacent to our Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa. \nHyatt Place Joint Venture\n. We own a 50% interest in a joint venture with White Lodging Services that owns the 255-room Hyatt Place Nashville Downtown in Tennessee. In August 2024, the joint venture completed an amendment and restatement of its $60 million mortgage loan agreement, extending its maturity to August 2, 2029. The loan is non-recourse to us. \nHarbor Beach Joint Venture. \nWe own a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with R/V-C Association that owns the 650-room Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa in Florida. The joint venture has a $158 million mortgage loan outstanding on the hotel that is non-recourse to us. Additional advances up to $27 million are available until December 31, 2025 to fund capital expenditures. \nAsia/Pacific Joint Venture. \nWe have a 25% interest in a joint venture with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. The agreement may be terminated by either partner at any time, which would trigger the liquidation of the joint venture. The commitment period for equity contributions to the joint venture has expired. Certain funding commitments remain, however, related to its existing investments in India.\nAs of December 31, 2024, this joint venture has invested approximately $109 million (of which our share is $27 million) in a separate joint venture in India with Accor S.A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited, in which it holds a 36% interest. This joint venture owns seven hotels and an office building in Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai, India, totaling approximately 1,718 rooms. The hotels are managed by AccorHotels under the Pullman, ibis and Novotel brands. \nFor additional information see \nPart II Item 8.\n “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4. Investments in Affiliates.”\nCompetition \nThe lodging industry is highly competitive. Competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on several factors, including location, brand, guest facilities and amenities, level of service, room rates and the quality of accommodations. The lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. The classification of a hotel is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many factors, such as guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. Most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as 1 Hotels\n®\n, Alila\n®\n,\n \nAndaz\n®\n, Fairmont\n®\n, Four Seasons\n®\n,\n \nGrand Hyatt\n®\n, JW Marriott\n®\n, Ritz-Carlton\n®\n, St. Regis\n®\n, The Don Cesar\n®\n, The Luxury Collection\n®\n and W\n®\n, or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as Autograph Collection\n®\n, Curio – A Collection by Hilton\n®\n, Embassy Suites by Hilton \n®\n, Hilton\n®\n, Hyatt Regency\n®\n, Marriott\n®\n, Marriott Marquis\n®\n, Sheraton\n®\n, Swissôtel\n®\n,\n \nTribute Portfolio\n®\n and Westin\n®\n.\n1\n While our hotels compete primarily with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale category, they also may compete with hotels in other lower-tier categories. A recent source of supply for the lodging industry has been the rapid growth of online short-term rentals, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings. Our hotels also may compete with these short-term rentals in certain markets. In addition, many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting, franchising or developing other hotels in our markets. As a result, our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise. \nWe also compete with other REITs and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities as we attempt to position our portfolio to best take advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers. \n1\n \nThis annual report contains registered trademarks that are the exclusive property of their respective owners, which are companies other than us. None of the owners of these trademarks, their affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, agents or employees has or will have any responsibility or liability for any information contained in this annual report. \n16\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality \nOur hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel and the region. Hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio were approximately 26%, 26%, 23% and 25% for the first, second, third and fourth calendar quarters, respectively, in 2024. \nEnvironmental, Governmental and Regulatory Matters \nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of hazardous or toxic materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the way property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future. \nOur hotels also are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we have in the past and may in the future incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible\n. \nThese and other building laws and regulations may be changed from time to time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, the imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. \nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of February 21, 2025, we had 165 employees, all of whom work in the United States, including our regional office in Miami. The current average tenure of our employees is approximately 14 years, and the voluntary and total turnover rates in 2024 were 2% and 5%, respectively. Our human capital objectives include encouraging individual contributions, reinforcing Host’s EPIC values and culture, maximizing employee engagement and retention and minimizing organizational disruption through succession action plans. Our employees are given the opportunity to participate in training and education programs such as external training, professional certifications, executive and leadership coaching, continuing education and professional memberships. Additionally, all employees receive annual performance reviews that incorporate our EPIC values and our competencies, which include adaptability, communication, teamwork and complete thinking. We encourage regular and ongoing feedback tied to performance and career development. In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives, we conduct employee surveys to obtain feedback on various topics, informing how we execute on specific programs. \nOur CEO is a part of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative to continue to advance diversity and inclusion within our workplace, along with our formal diversity and inclusion initiative. We also provide unconscious bias training to our employees. As of December 31, 2024, our total workforce consists of 43% men and 57% women, with 46% of management positions held by women. Our workforce also consists of 38% minorities, with 21% of management positions held by minorities. \nThe number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our three hotels in Brazil, which, while technically Host employees, are under the direct supervision and control of our third-party hotel manager in Brazil. The employees at all of our U.S. and Canadian hotels are employees of our third-party hotel managers, who are responsible for hiring and maintaining employees. \nAlthough we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels, we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force. Employees of our third-party hotel managers at 18 of our hotels, representing approximately 26% of our total room count, are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject \n17\nTable of Contents\nto review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships, see \nPart I Item 1A.\n “Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.” None of Host’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. \nWhere to Find Additional Information \nThe address of our principal executive office is 4747 Bethesda Ave, Suite 1300, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\nOverview\nHost Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2024. The remainder of Host L.P.’s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control. \nHost Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT’s composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 21, 2025, we own 81 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 40 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations. \nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 60%, 36%, and 4%, respectively, of our 2024 room sales. For a discussion of our customer categories, see “Item 1 Business – Our Customers”. \nUnderstanding Our Performance\nOur Revenues and Expenses.\n Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation). \nOperations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 98% of our total revenues and 2% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenue:\n% of 2024\nRevenues\n \n•\nRooms revenues\n. Occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenues. The business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and retail versus discount business) is a significant driver of room rates.\n60 \n%\n•\nFood and beverage revenues\n. Food & beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions, which may include banquet revenues and audio and visual revenues, as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our hotels.\n30 \n%\n•\nOther revenues\n. Occupancy, the nature of the hotel (e.g., resort) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenues, such as attrition and cancelation fees, resort and destination fees, parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services. This category also includes other rental revenues.\n10 \n%\n38\nTable of Contents\nHotel operating expenses represent approximately 99.7% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:\n% of 2024\nOperating\nCosts and\nExpenses\n \n•\nRooms expenses\n. These costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Occupancy is the major driver of rooms expenses. These costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided.\n18 \n%\n•\nFood and beverage expenses\n. These expenses primarily include food, beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues. Group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components generally will have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales.\n24 \n%\n•\nOther departmental and support expenses\n. These expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenues, such as parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, allocated brand costs, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs.\n29 \n%\n•\nManagement fees\n. Base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenues. Incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain thresholds.\n5 \n%\n•\nOther property-level expenses\n. These expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. Many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.\n9 \n%\n•\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n. This is a non-cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotels and the amounts of historical capital expenditures. This component also can include impairment expense.\n15 \n%\nThe expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 57% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.\nKey Performance Indicators.\n The following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITs:\n•\nhotel occupancy\n is a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold;\n•\naverage daily rate\n \n(“ADR”) \nis a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold;\n•\nrevenues per available room (“RevPAR”)\n is used to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and\n•\ntotal revenues per available room (“Total RevPAR”)\n is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. It includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of RevPAR.\n39\nTable of Contents\nRevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Our non-GAAP financial measures include:\n•\nNAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. \nWe use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business.\n•\nComparable hotel EBITDA.\n Hotel EBITDA measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate-level expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. We use comparable hotel EBITDA and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels.\n•\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre.\n Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. NAREIT adopted EBITDA for real estate (“EBITDA\nre”\n) in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust EBITDA\nre\n for property insurance gains and property damage losses, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business (“Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n”).\nSummary of 2024 Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):\nHistorical Income Statement Data:\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n5,684 \n$\n5,311 \n7.0 \n%\nNet income\n707 \n752 \n(6.0 \n%)\nOperating profit\n875 \n827 \n5.8 \n%\nOperating profit margin under GAAP\n15.4 \n%\n15.6 \n%\n(20)\n bps\nEBITDAre \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n1,726 \n$\n1,632 \n5.8 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDAre \n⁽¹⁾\n1,656 \n1,629 \n1.7 \n%\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.99 \n$\n1.04 \n(4.8 \n%)\nNAREIT FFO per diluted share \n⁽¹⁾\n1.97 \n1.92 \n2.6 \n%\nAdjusted FFO per diluted share\n ⁽¹⁾\n1.97 \n1.92 \n2.6 \n%\n40\nTable of Contents\nComparable Hotel Data:\n2024 Comparable Hotels ⁽¹⁾\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nComparable hotel revenues \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n5,546 \n$\n5,418 \n2.4 \n%\nComparable hotel EBITDA \n⁽¹⁾\n1,622 \n1,617 \n0.3 \n%\nComparable hotel EBITDA margin \n⁽¹⁾\n29.2 \n%\n29.8 \n%\n(60)\n bps\nComparable hotel Total RevPAR \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n355.88 \n$\n348.70 \n2.1 \n%\nComparable hotel RevPAR \n⁽¹⁾\n216.06 \n214.15 \n0.9 \n%\n___________\n \n(1)\nEBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and comparable hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally, comparable hotel results and statistics are based on 78 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2024 and include adjustments for non-comparable hotels, dispositions and acquisitions. See \"Comparable Hotel RevPAR Overview\" for results of the portfolio based on our ownership period, without these adjustments.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $373 million, or 7.0%, compared to 2023, benefiting from the 2024 acquisitions of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, 1 Hotel Central Park and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay and also the results of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed in the first half of 2023 as a result of Hurricane Ian. However, this was partially offset by the closure of The Don CeSar for the fourth quarter of 2024 following the impacts of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In addition, continued growth in group business, building on its recovery in 2023, drove improvements in food and beverage revenues. Comparable hotel RevPAR increased 0.9%, compared to 2023, due to an increase in average room rates, as occupancy remained flat, reflecting continued strong group demand, tempered by continued imbalance in outbound travel from the U.S. compared to international inbound travel and the slow recovery in Maui following the August 2023 wildfires. In 2024, performance at our Maui hotels impacted comparable hotel RevPAR by approximately 160 basis points for the full year.\nComparable hotel Total RevPAR increased 2.1% for the year due primarily to improvements in food and beverage revenues driven by the strength in group business, as well as strong spa and other ancillary revenues. The growth was led by our Denver, Nashville and Northern Virginia markets with increases of 13.2%, 12.9% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to 2023, through a combination of rate and occupancy growth, driven by strong group demand. Our hotels in Jacksonville and New Orleans also outperformed our portfolio with comparable hotel Total RevPAR increases of 7.2% and 7.1%, respectively. These strong performances were offset by comparable hotel Total RevPAR declines at our Atlanta and San Francisco/San Jose markets of 9.4% and 5.3%, respectively. The declines were driven primarily by a decrease in business travel and short-term transient demand, with Atlanta also affected by disruption from renovations. In addition, comparable hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui market declined by 11.0% due to the continuing impacts of the August 2023 Maui wildfires (see “Statement of Operations Results and Trends”). \nOperating Profit\nAs expected, we faced higher wages and inflationary pressures compared to 2023. This, coupled with Maui performance, led to an operating profit margin (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) decline of 20 basis points to 15.4% in 2024, compared to 15.6% in 2023, despite an increase in net gains on insurance settlements. Operating profit margins under GAAP are also significantly affected by several items, including acquisitions, dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our comparable hotel EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined 60 basis points to 29.2% for the year, down from 29.8% in 2023 due to the trends discussed above. \nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. was $707 million, a decrease of $45 million, or 6.0%, from the prior year, reflecting the decrease in gains on asset sales of $71 million and an increase in interest expense of $24 million, partially offset by an increase in net gains on insurance settlements of $24 million. These results led to a 4.8% decrease in diluted earnings per common share for Host Inc. to $0.99. Adjusted EBITDA\nre, \nwhich excludes gain on sale of assets and interest expense, among other items, increased 1.7% to $1,656 million as a result of operations from our acquisitions and the resumption of \n41\nTable of Contents\noperations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed during the first half of 2023, despite a $43 million decrease in business interruption gains. Adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 2.6% to $1.97 in 2024, reflecting the increase in Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as well as the impact of share repurchases in 2024 and 2023. \nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P. \n2025 Outlook\nThroughout 2024, group business at our properties continued to improve and group revenue on the books remains strong for 2025. Average rates remained elevated at our resorts compared to pre-pandemic levels, although they have moderated from post-pandemic highs. However, further growth has been hampered by the slow recovery from the wildfires in Maui, one of our largest markets by revenues, and the slower post-pandemic recovery of the San Francisco market. These trends are expected to continue into 2025. \nOn the macroeconomic front, the U.S. economy remained resilient during 2024 with real U.S. GDP growth of 2.8%, as unemployment remained at low levels and business investment grew at a robust 3.7%. U.S. lodging demand is correlated to changes in gross domestic product (GDP) and business investment, although the recovery of the industry post-pandemic has lagged that of the economy. Inflation moderated substantially during the year but remains a concern for 2025, with fewer rate cuts expected in the coming year. In addition, the new administration has brought heightened uncertainty due to anticipated changes to trade policy, tax policy and government spending. Other risks to economic growth remain, including geopolitical instability throughout the globe, high interest rates and volatile oil prices. As a result, leading indicators point toward slower economic growth in 2025. As of February 2025, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus projects real U.S. GDP growth of 2.2%, reflecting a deceleration from 2024. Business investment growth is also anticipated to slow over the coming year, averaging 2.3%, down from 3.7% in 2024. \nHotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the historical average, although we expect to see above-average growth in a few markets where our hotels are located, such as Nashville and Austin. Supply chain challenges have resulted in project delays across the U.S., and a tight lending environment has created construction financing challenges for future projects. We anticipate that the construction pipeline will remain modest until macroeconomic uncertainty moderates and interest rates decline further. \nBased on the trends noted, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the full year 2025 will be between 0.5% and 2.5%. In addition, we expect margins to decline in comparison to 2024, driven by higher wages and benefits, including increases driven by new union contracts in certain cities, as well as growth in insurance and real estate taxes. \nAs discussed above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains uncertain, reflecting varying analyst assumptions surrounding the impact of higher interest rates, inflation, the recovery in Maui and escalating geopolitical conflicts. Therefore, there can be no assurances as to lodging demand performance for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the slow recovery in Maui or deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see \nPart I, Item 1A.\n “Risk Factors.” \nStrategic Initiatives\nFor 2025, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use. \nAcquisitions\n. \nDuring 2024, we completed the following acquisitions:\n•\nthe 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million;\n•\nthe 234-room 1 Hotel Central Park for $265 million; and\n42\nTable of Contents\n•\nthe 450-room Turtle Bay Resort, including a 49-acre land parcel entitled for development, for a total purchase price of $680 million, which is net of $45 million in key money received from Marriott International as part of an agreement to transition management to Marriott and convert the property to The Ritz-Carlton brand. The property has been renamed The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay.\nCapital Projects. \nWe continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2024, we spent approximately $548 million on capital expenditures, of which $260 million represented return on investment (“ROI”) capital expenditures, $252 million represented renewal and replacement projects and $36 million was for hurricane restoration work. This included completing the final steps of our restoration efforts following Hurricane Ian of bringing the permanent central energy plant online at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. For all properties impacted by Hurricane Ian, we estimate the total property reconstruction and remediation costs, including significant enhancements, was approximately $315 million, of which approximately 30% related to remediation costs. In 2024, we reached a final settlement with our insurance providers on covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian, which totaled $308 million. In total, $99 million of the insurance receipts were recognized as a gain on business interruption. Another major capital project completed during the year was the repositioning renovations at The Singer Oceanfront Resort, Curio Collection by Hilton, including rooms, public space, and food and beverage outlets.\nIn addition, hotels within certain regions are subject to environmental and weather-related events, including hurricanes, wildfires, floods, rising sea levels, mudslides, earthquakes, and other natural perils. To mitigate some of these physical risks, we execute capital expenditure projects, including replacements and restorations of exterior walls, doors and windows, roofs, grounds, relocated/elevated critical equipment and distributed energy systems to further increase the resilience of our hotels. A portion of our capital expenditures for 2024 include these types of projects, which we expect to continue in future years. While the number of projects and overall cost varies from year to year, on average approximately 6% our capital expenditures have related to these types of projects over the past six years. The enhanced resilience projects implemented during the reconstruction of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples were successful in minimizing damage to the resort during the two hurricanes that made landfall in 2024; however, no assurances can be made as to whether these enhanced resiliency projects will be successful in mitigating the damage from future environmental and weather-related events, especially as the frequency and severity of these events are expected to increase over time.\nIn collaboration with Hyatt, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2023 at six properties in our portfolio, the Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead, Grand Hyatt Washington, Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego, Hyatt Regency Austin, Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, and Hyatt Regency Reston. These investments are intended to position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets while seeking to enhance long-term performance. During 2024, we spent approximately $155 million on this program, which is included in ROI capital projects. The total investment is expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million, two-thirds of which we were planning to invest as part of our capital plan over the next few years. We expect to invest between $125 million and $200 million per year on this program. Hyatt has agreed to provide additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees totaling $40 million to offset expected business disruptions. We received approximately $9 million of the operating profit guarantees in 2024 from Hyatt and expect to receive approximately $27 million in 2025.\nFor 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of $580 million to $670 million, consisting of ROI projects of approximately $270 million to $315 million, renewal and replacement expenditures of $240 million to $275 million, and $70 million to $80 million for the restoration work from the damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The ROI projects include approximately $170 million to $180 million for the Hyatt transformational capital program. \nAlso in 2023, we announced and broke ground on a project to develop and sell 40 fee-simple condominiums on a five-acre development parcel to be Four Seasons-branded and managed residences at the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World\n®\n Resort. Construction of the mid-rise building is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the villas are expected to complete in the first half of 2026. In 2024, we spent $64 million in development costs for this project and began marketing the units, resulting in buyer commitments for nearly one-third of the units. For 2025, the development costs for this project are expected to be $75 million to $85 million.\nFinancing transactions\n. \nOn April 1, 2024, we repaid $400 million of 3⅞% Series G senior notes at maturity. \nOn May 10, 2024, we issued $600 million of 5.700% Series K senior notes for proceeds of $584 million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay all \n43\nTable of Contents\noutstanding amounts then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility. The Series K senior notes have been designated as green bonds, and an amount equal to the net proceeds was allocated to finance and/or refinance one or more eligible green projects.\nOn August 12, 2024, we issued $700 million of 5.500% Series L senior notes for proceeds of $683 million, net of\noriginal issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds from this issuance were used in part to repay all $525 million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility, including amounts borrowed in connection with the acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park. \nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. As of December 31, 2024, we have a debt balance of $5.1 billion, our weighted average interest rate is 4.7%, and our weighted average debt maturity is 5.2 years.\nFor a detailed discussion, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5. Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare Repurchase and Dividends.\n In 2024, we repurchased 6.3 million shares at an average price of $16.99 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $107 million, under our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, we have $685 million available for repurchase under the program.\nDuring 2024, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $0.90 per share on its common stock, including a fourth quarter special dividend of $0.10 per share. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.9193446 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2024. On February 19, 2025, we announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock. The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2025 to stockholders of record on March 31, 2025. The amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.\nThere can be no assurances that any future dividends will match or exceed those set forth above for any number of reasons, including a decline in operations or an increase in liquidity needs. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.  \n44\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations \nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except percentages):\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n5,684 \n$\n5,311 \n7.0 \n%\nOperating costs and expenses:\nProperty-level costs \n⁽¹⁾\n4,796 \n4,438 \n8.1 \nCorporate and other expenses\n123 \n132 \n(6.8)\nNet gain on insurance settlements\n110 \n86 \n27.9 \nOperating profit\n875 \n827 \n5.8\nInterest expense\n215 \n191 \n12.6 \nOther gains\n— \n71 \n(100.0)\nProvision for income taxes\n14 \n36 \n(61.1)\nHost Inc.:\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n10 \n12 \n(16.7)\nNet income attributable to Host Inc.\n697 \n740 \n(5.8)\nHost L.P.:\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n1 \n1 \n— \nNet income attributable to Host L.P.\n706 \n751 \n(6.0)\n \n___________\n(1)\nAmounts represent total operating costs and expenses from our audited consolidated statements of operations, less corporate and other expenses and net gain on insurance settlements.\nStatement of Operations Results and Trends\nOperations improved in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting (i) the operations of our recent acquisitions, including 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024, 1 Hotel Central Park acquired in July 2024, and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay acquired in July 2024 (collectively, the \"2024 Acquisitions\"); (ii) strong group business which led to improvements in food and beverage revenues, and (iii) the resumption of operations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed during the first half of 2023 as a result of Hurricane Ian. The improvements were partially offset by a slow recovery in Maui and the closures of Alila Ventana Big Sur, which closed at the end of March 2024 and reopened on May 22, 2024, following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California, and The Don CeSar, which closed on September 25, 2024 and remains closed due to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nThe following table presents revenues in accordance with GAAP and includes all consolidated hotels for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except percentages):\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nRevenues:\nRooms\n$\n3,426 \n$\n3,244 \n5.6 \n%\nFood and beverage\n1,716 \n1,582 \n8.5 \n%\nOther\n542 \n485 \n11.8 \n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n5,684 \n$\n5,311 \n7.0 \n%\nRooms\n. Total rooms revenues increased $182 million, or 5.6%, in 2024, reflecting the operations of the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Rooms revenues at our comparable hotels increased $40 million, or 1.2%, driven by an increase in average room rates compared to 2023. \n45\nTable of Contents\nFood and beverage\n. Total food and beverage (\"F&B\") revenues increased $134 million, or 8.5%, in 2024, due to the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Comparable F&B revenues increased $57 million, or 3.6%, driven by improvements in banquet and audio-visual revenues at resort and convention hotels as group demand remained strong throughout the year. \nOther revenues\n. Total other revenues increased $57 million, or 11.8%, in 2024, driven by results from the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Other revenues at our comparable hotels increased $31 million, or 6.2%, primarily due to strong spa and other ancillary revenues.\nProperty-level Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP and includes all consolidated hotels for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except percentages):\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nExpenses:\nRooms\n$\n849 \n$\n787 \n7.9 \n%\nFood and beverage\n1,137 \n1,042 \n9.1 \n%\nOther departmental and support expenses\n1,383 \n1,280 \n8.0 \n%\nManagement fees\n254 \n249 \n2.0 \n%\nOther property-level expenses\n411 \n383 \n7.3 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n762 \n697 \n9.3 \n%\nTotal property-level operating expenses\n$\n4,796 \n$\n4,438 \n8.1 \n%\nOur operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet, audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 57% of these expenses in any given year. During 2024, these expenses increased approximately 5% compared to 2023, primarily due to an overall increase in general wage rates and benefits. Wage and benefit rate inflation is expected to be approximately 6% in 2025.\nOther property-level expenses consist of property taxes, the amounts and structure of which are highly dependent on local jurisdiction taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, all of which do not necessarily increase or decrease based on similar changes in revenues at our hotels.\nThe increases in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees were generally due to the corresponding increases in revenues due to the 2024 Acquisitions, the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, and also reflected increased expenses at our comparable hotels primarily due to increased wages and benefits, as follows:\nRooms\n. Rooms expenses increased $62 million, or 7.9%, in 2024. Our comparable hotels rooms expenses increased $33 million, or 4.1%, in 2024, driven by an overall increase in wage rates. Wages and benefits represented approximately 67% of our 2024 and 2023 rooms expenses.\nFood and beverage. \nF&B expenses increased $95 million, or 9.1%, in 2024. For our comparable hotels, F&B expenses increased $41 million, or 3.9%, in 2024. Overall, F&B costs as a percentage of revenues remained consistent year over year. Wages and benefits represented approximately 69% of our 2024 and 2023 F&B expenses.\nOther departmental and support expenses\n. Other departmental and support expenses increased $103 million, or 8.0%, in 2024. On a comparable hotel basis, other departmental and support expenses increased $62 million, or 3.2%. These increases were primarily due to higher wage expense. Wages and benefits represented approximately 41% of our 2024 and 2023 other departmental and support expenses.\n46\nTable of Contents\nManagement fees\n. Total management fees increased $5 million, or 2.0%, in 2024. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased $10 million, or 6.7%, compared to 2023. At our comparable hotels, base management fees increased $6 million, or 3.8%, for 2024. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, decreased $5 million, primarily due to the closure of The Don CeSar, and the decrease at our comparable hotels of $3 million, or 2.8%, which was due to renovations at certain properties. \nOther property-level expenses\n. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses increased $28 million, or 7.3%, in 2024, due to increases in property insurance premiums and property taxes. Other property-level expenses at our comparable hotels increased $12 million, or 3.1%, in 2024. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott and Hyatt under the transformational capital programs in both 2024 and 2023.\nOther Income and Expenses \nCorporate and other expenses\n.\n Corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nGeneral and administrative costs\n$\n93 \n$\n85 \nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense\n24\n30 \nLitigation accruals\n6\n17 \n       Total        \n$\n123 \n$\n132 \nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. The overall decrease in corporate and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily due to a decrease in litigation accruals, partially offset by an increase in systems costs and other administrative fees.\nNet gain on insurance settlements.\n The following table details our gain on insurance settlements for property damage and business interruption, net of property damage and remediation losses, related to Hurricanes Ian, Helene and Milton, the Maui wildfires and other weather events (in millions): \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nProperty damage\nHurricanes Helene/Milton\n(6)\n— \nHurricane Ian\n72\n3 \nOther\n4\n— \nBusiness interruption\nHurricane Ian\n19\n80 \nMaui wildfires\n21\n— \nOther\n—\n3 \nNet gain on insurance settlements\n$\n110 \n$\n86 \n47\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense\n.\n Interest expense increased $24 million, or 12.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances during 2024 as we issued additional senior notes to fund our 2024 Acquisitions.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $1 million, or 16.7%, in 2024, reflecting increased earnings from our investment in the Noble joint venture, partially offset by a $6 million loss for our share of an inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture.\nProvision for income taxes. \nWe lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of $14 million and $36 million, respectively, due primarily to the profitability of hotel operations retained by the TRS, including $40 million and $83 million of business interruption insurance gains recorded in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2024 tax provision was partially offset by the recognition of an income tax benefit due to federal income tax credits resulting from the installation of a co-generation plant at one of our properties. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act in 2020, a portion of the 2020 domestic net operating loss was carried back to 2017-2019 in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. The remaining portion of the 2020 net operating loss, as well as the entire 2021 net operating loss incurred by our TRS, may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof equal to 80% of annual taxable income. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Income Taxes” for a discussion of our income taxes.\nComparable Hotel RevPAR Overview\nWe discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we consolidate as of the reporting periods being compared. Comparable hotels do not include the results of hotels sold or classified as held-for-sale, hotels that have sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or hotels that have undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer during the reporting periods being compared. We believe this provides investors with a better understanding of underlying growth trends for our current portfolio, without impact from properties that experienced closures. We have removed The Don CeSar, Alila Ventana Big Sur, and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples from our comparable operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to closures. See “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” below for more information on how we determine our comparable hotels. Beginning in third quarter of 2024, we have separated the Oahu and Maui markets. \nWe also include, following the comparable hotels results by geographic location, the same operating statistics presentation on an actual basis, which includes results for our portfolio for the time period of our ownership, including the \n48\nTable of Contents\nresults of non-comparable properties, dispositions through their date of disposal and acquisitions beginning as of the date of acquisition. Lastly, we discuss our hotel results by mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).\nHotel Operating Data by Location\n.\nThe following table sets forth performance information for our hotels by geographic location as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 on a comparable hotel and actual basis:\nComparable Hotel Results by Location\nAs of December 31, 2024\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nLocation\nNo. of\nProperties\nNo. of\nRooms\nAverage\nRoom Rate\nAverage\nOccupancy\nPercentage \nRevPAR\nTotal RevPAR\nAverage\nRoom Rate\nAverage\nOccupancy\nPercentage \nRevPAR\nTotal RevPAR\nPercent\nChange in\nRevPAR \nPercent\nChange in\nTotal RevPAR \nMaui\n3\n1,580\n$\n663.09 \n60.1 \n%\n$\n398.83 \n$\n641.01 \n$\n707.50 \n67.4 \n%\n$\n476.56 \n$\n720.14 \n(16.3 \n%)\n(11.0 \n%)\nOahu\n (1)\n2\n876\n457.70 \n81.2 \n%\n371.85 \n576.36 \n442.57 \n76.4 \n%\n338.25 \n544.70 \n9.9 \n%\n5.8 \n%\nMiami\n2\n1,038\n526.83 \n70.2 \n%\n369.84 \n641.42 \n533.31 \n66.9 \n%\n356.86 \n624.20 \n3.6 \n%\n2.8 \n%\nJacksonville\n1\n446\n517.28 \n71.2 \n%\n368.44 \n840.68 \n503.57 \n69.9 \n%\n351.80 \n784.10 \n4.7 \n%\n7.2 \n%\nNew York\n3\n2,720\n392.96 \n84.6 \n%\n332.63 \n463.36 \n373.48 \n82.6 \n%\n308.54 \n436.70 \n7.8 \n%\n6.1 \n%\nPhoenix\n3\n1,545\n395.73 \n70.0 \n%\n276.93 \n646.95 \n399.79 \n71.5 \n%\n285.85 \n637.23 \n(3.1 \n%)\n1.5 \n%\nNashville\n2\n721\n344.36 \n79.7 \n%\n274.37 \n447.79 \n344.85 \n74.5 \n%\n256.76 \n396.48 \n6.9 \n%\n12.9 \n%\nOrlando\n2\n2,448\n383.93 \n65.1 \n%\n249.76 \n528.04 \n384.63 \n67.9 \n%\n261.32 \n521.26 \n(4.4 \n%)\n1.3 \n%\nLos Angeles/Orange County\n3\n1,067\n297.23 \n78.1 \n%\n232.13 \n350.62 \n300.29 \n81.7 \n%\n245.49 \n360.91 \n(5.4 \n%)\n(2.9 \n%)\nSan Diego\n3\n3,294\n293.18 \n78.9 \n%\n231.22 \n433.50 \n282.20 \n78.4 \n%\n221.29 \n414.34 \n4.5 \n%\n4.6 \n%\nFlorida Gulf Coast\n3\n1,055\n321.75 \n69.9 \n%\n224.78 \n492.13 \n321.00 \n70.7 \n%\n226.95 \n497.52 \n(1.0 \n%)\n(1.1 \n%)\nBoston\n2\n1,496\n280.30 \n78.1 \n%\n218.97 \n287.46 \n264.18 \n78.2 \n%\n206.66 \n275.90 \n6.0 \n%\n4.2 \n%\nWashington, D.C.

The information below is derived from business mix results from the 78 comparable hotels owned as of December 31, 2024.\nImprovements in 2024 compared to 2023 were primarily driven by an increase in group business, through increases in average rates and occupancy, as our convention and downtown properties continued to benefit from group demand. The growth in group demand was partially offset by a 0.3% decrease in transient revenue, reflecting the impacts of the Maui wildfires and moderating leisure demand.  \n50\nTable of Contents\nThe following are the results of our transient, group and contract business:\nYear ended December 31, 2024\n \nTransient\nbusiness\n \nGroup\nbusiness\n \nContract\nbusiness\n \nRoom nights (in thousands)\n5,966 \n4,256 \n752 \nPercentage change in room nights vs. same period in 2023\n(0.3 \n%)\n0.8 \n%\n2.7 \n%\nRooms Revenues (in millions)\n$\n2,016 \n$\n1,196 \n$\n155 \nPercentage change in rooms revenues vs. same period in 2023\n(0.3 \n%)\n2.7 \n%\n11.5 \n%\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P. \nOverview. \nWe look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and positioning us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, only one of our consolidated hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund, corporate expenses, capital expenditures, hotel acquisitions and dividends and remain well positioned to execute additional investment transactions to the extent opportunities arise.\nCash Requirements. \nWe use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and Host L.P. limited partners and stock and OP unit repurchases. Our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. In the short term, our cash obligations include $500 million of senior notes due in June 2025. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay them at maturity, or we can refinance the notes with our access to capital markets. For our long-term senior note and credit facility obligations, we historically have refinanced these amounts prior to their maturity through the issuance of new senior notes or the entry into new credit facility agreements. Whether we will refinance the June 2025 senior notes upon maturity with new senior notes will depend upon market conditions generally, including the interest rate environment, and our cash requirements. Also, in the short term, our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2025 are approximately $31 million, and most of our other operating obligations. In the long term, our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 100 years. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report.\nIn addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $580 million to $670 million in 2025. Commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project. In the long term, renewal and replacement (\"R&R\") capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels and typically occur at intervals of seven to ten years. The projects are primarily funded through the FF&E reserves established at each hotel. Average annual R&R spend over the last five years has been $245 million. \n51\nTable of Contents\nOur 2025 capital expenditures budget includes approximately $70 million to $80 million for restoration work at our Florida properties affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024, primarily at The Don CeSar, which sustained significant damage and remains closed. We estimate the total property reconstruction and remediation costs from the storms, including resiliency enhancements, for The Don CeSar to be approximately $100 million to $110 million of which approximately 25-30% relates to remediation costs. We believe our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the property remediation and reconstruction costs and the near-term loss of business in excess of our deductibles of approximately $20 million, although the timing for the receipt of insurance proceeds remains uncertain. \nAs part of our investment in our Noble joint venture, we have made a $211.5 million capital commitment to Noble Fund V and an additional capital commitment of $30 million through a related co-investment. As of December 31, 2024, we have funded $72 million and $13 million of these commitments, respectively, with the remaining amounts expected to be paid within the next two years.\nAs a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies” for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees and a more detailed description of the damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. \nCapital Resources.\n As of December 31, 2024, we had $554 million of cash and cash equivalents, $242 million  in our FF&E escrow reserve and $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of our credit facility. In the near term, with the exception of the $500 million Series E senior notes due in June 2025, as described above, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our dividends, capital expenditures program, debt service and operating and corporate costs, primarily through hotel operations and our existing cash reserves. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2024 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations. Future acquisitions and/or obligations also may be funded through a draw on the available portion of the revolver under our credit facility, equity issuances, or asset sales.\nWe depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments, is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. \nThe following graph summarizes our aggregate debt maturities as of February 21, 2025:\n \n___________\n(1)\nThe first term loan under our credit facility that is due in 2027 has an extension option that would extend maturity of the instrument to 2028, subject to meeting certain conditions, including payment of a fee. The second term loan tranche that is due in 2028 does not have an extension option.\n(2)\nMortgage and other debt excludes principal amortization of $2 million each year from 2025-2027 for the mortgage loan that matures in 2027.\n52\nTable of Contents\nGiven the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2023, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously. \nTwo programs currently are in place relating to purchases and sales of our common stock. First, under our common stock repurchase program, common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. In the fourth quarter of 2024, no shares were repurchased. For full year 2024, we repurchased 6.3 million shares at an average price of $16.99 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $107 million. At December 31, 2024, we had $685 million available for repurchase under the program.\nSecond, on May 31, 2023, we entered into a distribution agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents pursuant to which Host Inc. may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of Host Inc. common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $600 million. The sales will be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings under the SEC rules. We may sell shares of Host Inc. common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares. We may sell shares when we believe conditions are advantageous and there is a compelling use of proceeds, including to fund future potential acquisitions or other investment opportunities. The agreement also contemplates that, in addition to the offering and sale of shares to or through the sales agents, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with each of the forward purchasers named in the agreement. No shares were issued in 2023 or 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there was $600 million of remaining capacity under the agreement. \nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded by cash, debt issuances by Host L.P., equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or proceeds from sales of hotels. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.\nSources and Uses of Cash. \nIn 2024, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations and proceeds from debt issuances. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, share repurchases and distributions to equity holders. We anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar in 2025. \nCash Provided by Operating Activities\n. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2024 was $1,498 million, an increase of $57 million compared to 2023, reflecting the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed for the first half of 2023, as well as operations from our 2024 Acquisitions, partially offset by payments for the development of condo units at Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World\n®\n Resort.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\n. Approximately $2,040 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2024 compared to $183 million in 2023. The increase reflects the significant acquisition and joint venture investment activity in 2024 compared to the disposition-related activity in 2023 as detailed in the charts below. Additionally, cash used in investing activities included $548 million of capital expenditures in 2024, compared to $646 million in 2023. These \n53\nTable of Contents\namounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with GAAP. These capitalized costs were $18 million, $24 million and $20 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nThe following tables summarize significant acquisitions, dispositions and investments in affiliates from January 1, 2023 through February 21, 2025 (in millions):\nTransaction Date\nDescription of Transaction\nInvestment\n \nAcquisitions/Investments\nJanuary - December\n2024\nInvestment in Noble JV\n$\n(52)\nJuly\n2024\nAcquisition of The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay \n(1)\n(680)\nJuly\n2024\nAcquisition of 1 Hotel Central Park\n(265)\nApril\n2024\nAcquisition of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown\n(530)\nTotal acquisitions/investments\n$\n(1,527)\n \n___________\n(1)\nInvestment amount represents a sales price of $725 million net of $45 million of key money received from Marriott International in connection with the conversion of the property to The Ritz-Carlton brand and includes the acquisition of a 49-acre land parcel entitled for development.

The loan was repaid in November 2023.\n(4)\nIn connection with the sale of the Sheraton Boston, we extended a $163 million bridge loan to the purchaser. The loan was repaid in September 2023.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\n. Net cash used in financing activities was $13 million for 2024, compared to $771 million in 2023. Cash used in financing activities in 2024 and 2023 included the payment of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases, and, in 2024, these were mostly offset by a net issuance of senior notes of $867 million.\nWe utilized the revolver under our credit facility for various funding needs in 2024 with all borrowings repaid by year end.

The Series K senior notes are due in July 2034, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, commencing January 1, 2025. The Series K senior notes were issued as a “green bond,” and we allocated an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the Series K senior notes to finance and/or refinance one or more eligible green projects, including the April 2024 acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Nashville Downtown, each of which has received LEED Silver certification. Following the allocation to eligible green projects, the net proceeds of this issuance were used to repay all $215 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility at that time. The Series K senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the July 1, 2034 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series K senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nOn August 12, 2024, we issued $700 million of 5.500% Series L senior notes in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of approximately $683 million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series L senior notes are due in April 2035 and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2025. The net proceeds were used in part to repay all $525 million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our senior credit facility, including amounts borrowed during the third quarter in connection with the acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O’ahu, Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park. The Series L senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the April 15, 2035 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series L senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nThe following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indenture governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided with respect to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees with respect to the senior notes.\nAll of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2024 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.’s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is \n56\nTable of Contents\nbased on Host L.P.’s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have met the minimum financial covenant levels under our senior notes indentures. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2024:\nActual Ratio\nCovenant Requirement\nUnencumbered assets tests\n438 \n%\nMinimum ratio of 150%\nTotal indebtedness to total assets\n23 \n%\nMaximum ratio of 65%\nSecured indebtedness to total assets\n<1%\nMaximum ratio of 40%\nEBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio\n7.0x\nMinimum ratio of 1.5x\nCredit Facility.\n On January 4, 2023, we entered into the sixth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion. The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of either a 1-year extension option or two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1 -year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 4, 2028, which date may not be extended.\nNeither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).\nGuarantees. \nSimilar to our senior note indenture, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. senior unsecured debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nPrepayments. \nVoluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty. \nFinancial Covenants. \nThe credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. These calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred \n57\nTable of Contents\nfinancing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance. \nWe are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2024: \nActual Ratio\nCovenant Requirement\n for all years\nLeverage ratio\n2.7x\nMaximum ratio of 7.25x\nFixed charge coverage ratio\n5.5x\nMinimum ratio of 1.25x\nUnsecured interest coverage ratio ⁽¹⁾\n7.0x\nMinimum ratio of 1.75x\n___________\n(1)\nIf at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio requirement will decrease to 1.50x. \nInterest and Fees.\n The 2023 amendment and restatement also converted the underlying reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points. We pay interest on U.S. dollar revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points) plus a margin ranging from 72.5 to 140 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). We also pay a facility fee on the total $1.5 billion revolver commitment ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. We also may elect to pay interest on revolver and term loan borrowings using a base rate plus a margin that is similarly determined based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating. The credit facility includes a sustainability pricing adjustment that can result in a change in the interest rate applicable to borrowings. The adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate for revolving loans of up to 4 basis points and an increase or decrease of the facility fee of up to 1 basis point. In the case of the term loans, the adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate applicable of up to 5 basis points. The adjustments will be determined annually on the basis of an annual audited report of Host L.P.’s performance against targets established in the credit facility for (1) the percentage of our consolidated portfolio with green building certifications and (2) the percentage of electricity used at all our consolidated properties that is generated by renewable resources. Effective June 26, 2024, we achieved a milestone in the progress towards both of our targets, resulting in the maximum benefit of the basis point reduction in the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2024, we are able to borrow on the revolver at a rate of adjusted SOFR plus 85 basis points less 4 basis points for meeting sustainability milestones for an all-in rate of 5.25% and pay a facility fee of 19 basis points. \nInterest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points) plus a margin ranging from 80 to 160 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating) and adjusted for sustainability pricing. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2024, our applicable margin on SOFR loans under both term loans is 95 basis points, less 5 basis points for meeting sustainability milestones, for an all-in rate of 5.34%. \nOther Covenants and Events of Default.\n The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on the incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.\nThe credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments automatically will terminate.\nMortgage Debt, Including Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.\n At December 31, 2024, we own one consolidated property that is encumbered by mortgage debt. All of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2024, our mortgage debt has an interest rate of 4.67% and matures in 2027, with principal and interest payments due monthly. We also own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity \n58\nTable of Contents\nmethod. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $240 million at December 31, 2024. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.\nDistributions/Dividends\n.\n Host Inc.’s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. For the fourth quarter of 2024, Host Inc. paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.10 per share on its common stock on January 15, 2025 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2024. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. \nFunds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 2024, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit.\nInvestors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders. \nCounterparty Credit Risk.\n We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the critical accounting policies related to impairment testing on our property and equipment and valuation of acquisitions, which require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.\nComparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\nTo facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below), during the reporting periods being compared.\nWe make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally, operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale. \n59\nTable of Contents\nThe hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.\nSimilarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often, related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel, we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in net gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains covering lost revenues while the property was considered non-comparable also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.\nOf the 81 hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2024, 78 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of December 31, 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:\n•\nThe Don CeSar (business disruption due to Hurricane Helene resulting in closure of the hotel beginning at the end of September 2024);\n•\nAlila Ventana Big Sur (business disruption due to the collapse of a portion of Highway 1, causing closure of the hotel beginning in March 2024, reopened in May 2024); \n•\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022, reopened in July 2023); and\n•\nSales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) comparable hotel operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P. \nWe calculate EBITDA\nre\n and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDA\nre\n and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDA\nre \nand FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration\n \nand other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\n Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, \n60\nTable of Contents\nEBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit. \nSimilarly, EBITDA\nre\n, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 40 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host L.P. held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA\nre \nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance. \nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre \nEBITDA \nEarnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.  \nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nWe present EBITDA\nre\n in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDA\nre\n as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDA\nre\n of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDA\nre\n when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDA\nre\n for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n: \n•\nProperty Insurance Gains and Property Damage Losses\n – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets. Similarly, losses from property damage or remediation costs that are not covered through insurance are excluded. \n61\nTable of Contents\n•\nAcquisition Costs\n – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company. \n•\nLitigation Gains and Losses\n – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.\n•\nSeverance Expense \n– In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\n•\nEffective January 1, 2025, we will exclude the expense recorded for non-cash stock-based compensation, as it represents a non-cash transaction and the add back is consistent with the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for our financial covenant ratios under our credit facility and senior notes indentures and consistent with the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n for the majority of other lodging REIT filers. In 2024, this amount totaled $24 million.\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDA\nre\n for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n to net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:  \nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n for Host Inc. and Host L.P. \n(in millions) \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNet income⁽¹⁾\n$\n707 \n$\n752 \nInterest expense\n215 \n191 \nDepreciation and amortization\n762 \n697 \nIncome taxes\n14 \n36 \nEBITDA⁽¹⁾\n1,698 \n1,676 \nGain on dispositions⁽²⁾\n— \n(70)\nEquity investment adjustments:\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n(7)\n(6)\nPro rata EBITDAre of equity investments⁽³⁾\n35 \n32 \nEBITDAre⁽¹⁾\n1,726 \n1,632 \nAdjustments to EBITDA\nre\n:\nNet gain on property insurance settlements\n(70)\n(3)\nAdjusted EBITDAre⁽¹⁾\n$\n1,656 \n$\n1,629 \n___________\n(1)\nNet income, EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO for the year ended December 31, 2024 include a loss of $6 million related to inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, reflected through equity in earnings of affiliates.\n(2)\nReflects the sale of one hotel in 2023.\n(3)\nUnrealized gains of our unconsolidated investments are not recognized in our EBITDA\nre,\n Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO or Adjusted FFO until they have been realized by the unconsolidated partnership.\n62\nTable of Contents\nFFO Measures\nWe present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.\nWe believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. \nWe also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:\n•\nGains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt\n – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. \n•\nAcquisition Costs\n –Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company. \n•\nLitigation Gains and Losses\n – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. \n•\nSeverance Expense – \nIn certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\n•\nEffective January 1, 2025, we will exclude the expense recorded for non-cash stock-based compensation, as it represents a non-cash transaction and the add back is consistent with the calculation \n63\nTable of Contents\nof Adjusted EBITDA for our financial covenant ratios under our credit facility and senior notes indentures and consistent with the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share for the majority of other lodging REIT filers. In 2024, this amount totaled $24 million.\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO. \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:\nHost Inc.

Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling limited partners and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive.\n64\nTable of Contents\nComparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results\nWe present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a comparable hotel, or \"same store,\" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage, as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.\nBecause of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWe present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate.
