Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024 as filed with the SEC on February 19, 2025. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. Certain percentage changes may not recalculate due to rounding.\nOverview\nWe are a leading, full service, non-clinical global drug development partner. For over 75 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in the research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, that supports our clients from target identification through non-clinical development. We also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities. Utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more efficient and flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.\nOur client base includes major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies; agricultural and industrial chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies around the world.\nSegment Reporting\nOur three reportable segments are Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA), and Manufacturing Solutions (Manufacturing). \nOur RMS reportable segment includes the products and services offered within Research Models, Research Model Services, and Cell Solutions. Research Models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. Research Model Services includes: Insourcing Solutions (IS), which provides colony management of our clients’ research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing, and management services) within our clients’ facilities as well as our own vivarium space, utilizing our Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab (CRADL™) offerings, Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS), which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered models; and Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS), which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and Cell Solutions which provides controlled, consistent, customized primary cells and blood components derived from normal and mobilized peripheral blood and bone marrow as well as cells from disease state donors.\nOur DSA segment is comprised of Discovery and Safety Assessment services. We provide regulated and non-regulated DSA services to support the discovery, development, and regulatory-required safety testing of potential new drugs, including \nin vitro\n (non-animal) and \nin vivo\n (in research models) studies, laboratory support services, including bioanalytical and strategic non-clinical consulting and program management to support product development.\nOur Manufacturing reportable segment includes Microbial Solutions, which provides \nin vitro\n lot-release testing products, microbial detection products, and species identification services and Biologics Solutions (Biologics), which performs specialized testing of biologics (Biologics Testing Solutions) as well as contract development and manufacturing products and services (CDMO).\nFiscal Quarters\nOur fiscal year is typically based on 52-weeks, with each quarter composed of 13 weeks ending on the last Saturday on, or closest to, March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. A 53rd week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year is occasionally necessary to align with a December 31 calendar year-end.\nGlobal Market Environment\nWe are continuing to see a cautious spending environment from our client base, principally within our DSA segment related to our global biopharmaceutical and biotechnology clients, as they reassess their budgets, reprioritize their drug pipelines, and manage their cost structures. As we continue to navigate these challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, DSA backlog declined slightly to $1.8 billion as of September 27, 2025 from $2.0 billion as of December 28, 2024.\n26 \nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nIn response to recent trends observed across each of our businesses in the global market environment, we have undertaken and will continue to implement restructuring actions at various locations across North America, Europe and Asia. This includes workforce right-sizing actions, resulting in severance and transition costs; and costs related to the consolidation of facilities to optimize our global footprint and drive greater operating efficiency across the company, resulting in asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, and other site consolidation charges. During fiscal year 2023, we began taking restructuring actions as a result of these emerging business trends. We incurred restructuring charges of $17.3 million and $73.3 million, during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025, respectively, and $107.0 million and $29.7 million during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. We expect that these effectuated actions, as well as other upcoming planned actions designed to optimize our global footprint to drive greater operating efficiency, will result in approximately $225 million of cost savings on an annualized basis, of which approximately $175 million will impact fiscal year 2025.\nStrategic Review\nIn November 2025, we announced as part of our Board of Directors’ comprehensive strategic review of our business and growth prospects, that we will focus on strategic initiatives to strengthen our leading scientific portfolio within our core markets through strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and internal investments; divest certain underperforming or non-core assets, which represent approximately 7% of the Company’s estimated 2025 revenue; maximize our financial performance, including by implementing additional initiatives aimed at driving greater operating efficiency, which are expected to generate incremental net cost savings of approximately $70 million annually, which will be fully realized in 2026; and maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment through regularly evaluating the optimal balance between strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt repayment, and other uses of capital.\nRecent Government Actions\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”), which includes changes to a broad range of tax reform provisions including accelerated tax depreciation, expensing of research and development, and the U.S. international inclusions. We have analyzed the impacts of the OBBBA and reflected them in the current period. The enactment of the OBBBA did not have a material impact to the tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025.\nIn February 2025 the U.S. government announced plans to enact increased tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, later broadening the increase to various countries within Europe, Africa and Asia. As of the date of this report, a number of new tariffs remain in effect, including tariffs between the U.S., and countries from which we obtain significant supply, such as Vietnam, Mauritius and China. The extent and duration of these tariffs and the resulting impact on macroeconomic conditions and our business are uncertain and may depend on various factors including, but not limited to, negotiations between the U.S. and affected countries, reciprocal or retaliatory actions imposed by other countries, tariff exemptions, negative sentiment toward U.S. companies and products, and the availability of lower cost inputs that may be sourced domestically. While we plan to offset most of the estimated tariffs by passing along these higher costs, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts to our business and our operating results.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to launch a pilot program to reduce animal testing in preclinical safety studies with scientifically validated cell-based and new approach methodologies (NAMs), such as organ-on-a-chip systems, computational modeling, and advanced in vitro assays. We support the FDA’s announcement as we believe the program aligns with the vision previously outlined in the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 and aims to develop a clearer regulatory pathway to streamline the drug development process and safely advance innovative technologies, including alternatives to the current animal based development process. As a leader in preclinical drug development, this vision is consistent with our long-standing mission to drive greater efficiency in the drug development process, enhance scientific innovation, and promote the responsible use of animals in biomedical research. We are continuously evaluating innovative approaches in drug development and have invested in virtual control groups for safety assessment studies and partnerships utilizing AI technologies to reduce animal use. Further, in April 2024, we launched our own Alternative Methods Advancement Project (AMAP), which is an initiative dedicated to developing alternatives to the use of animal testing within the drug development process. In October 2025, we announced the creation of a cross-functional Scientific Advisory Board to guide our strategic focus on NAMs. We remain committed to continuing to collaborate with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, the biopharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders, to help develop, validate, and implement an efficient process for our clients’ regulatory submissions that support the use of new, non-animal based technologies.\nU.S. Government Investigations into the Non-Human Primate Supply Chain\nOn May 16, 2023, we received an inquiry from the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting us to voluntarily provide information, subsequently augmented with a document subpoena and additional inquiries, primarily related to the sourcing of non-human primates and related disclosures, and we are cooperating with the requests. Our Audit Committee has retained counsel to conduct an independent investigation into certain issues raised in the investigations, and that work is ongoing. We are not able to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the SEC. The SEC has not provided us with any specific timeline or indication as to when the investigation will be concluded or \n27 \nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nresolved. We cannot predict the timing, outcome or possible impact of the investigation, including without limitation any potential fines, penalties or liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations and Liquidity\nRevenue for three months ended September 27, 2025 decreased $4.9 million, or 0.5%, to $1,004.9 million compared to $1,009.8 million in the corresponding period in 2024. Revenue for nine months ended September 27, 2025 decreased $26.3 million, or 0.9%, to $3,021.2 million compared to $3,047.4 million in the corresponding period in 2024. The decreases in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 was primarily attributable to declines in our DSA and Manufacturing businesses, which experienced lower volume driven by continued cautious client spending as a result of the demand environment; partially offset by higher revenue in our RMS business, primarily driven by Noveprim, when compared to the corresponding periods in 2024.\nFor the three months ended September 27, 2025, our operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue were $133.8 million and 13.3% respectively, compared to $117.4 million and 11.6% respectively, in the corresponding period of 2024. The increases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 27, 2025 were primarily driven by lower severance costs, coupled with lower unallocated corporate employee compensation and benefits related costs when compared to the corresponding period in 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2025, our operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue were $308.6 million and 10.2% respectively, compared to $395.0 million and 13.0% respectively, in the corresponding period of 2024. The decreases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 were primarily driven by the acceleration of amortization expense recognized as a result of a decrease in the remaining useful life of certain CDMO client relationships due to a loss of key customers, increased restructuring activities, including higher asset impairments and site consolidation charges, and higher third-party legal and advisory costs when compared to the corresponding period in 2024.\nNet income available to Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., common shareholders decreased to $54.4 million in the three months ended September 27, 2025, from $68.7 million in the corresponding period of 2024. Net income available to Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., common shareholders decreased to $132.2 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2025, from $226.0 million in the corresponding period of 2024. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was due principally to higher net losses and impairments on our venture capital and strategic equity investments; partially offset by the increase in operating income described above compared to the corresponding period in 2024. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was due principally to the decrease in operating income described above coupled with higher net losses and impairments on our venture capital and strategic equity investments compared to the corresponding period in 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 27, 2025, our cash flows from operations were $590.1 million compared with $575.2 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by lower payments of variable compensation and favorable timing of payments to our suppliers and vendors, partially offset by higher purchases of inventory to support our DSA reportable segment.\n28 \nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nThree Months Ended September 27, 2025 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 \nRevenue and Operating Income\nThe following tables present consolidated revenue by type and by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n$ change\n% change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nService revenue\n$\n808,042 \n$\n832,463 \n$\n(24,421)\n(2.9)\n%\nProduct revenue\n196,810 \n177,300 \n19,510 \n11.0 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n1,004,852 \n$\n1,009,763 \n$\n(4,911)\n(0.5)\n%\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n$ change\n% change\nImpact of FX\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRMS\n$\n213,474 \n$\n197,824 \n$\n15,650 \n7.9 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nDSA\n600,685 \n615,060 \n(14,375)\n(2.3)\n%\n1.2 \n%\nManufacturing\n190,693 \n196,879 \n(6,186)\n(3.1)\n%\n2.0 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n1,004,852 \n$\n1,009,763 \n$\n(4,911)\n(0.5)\n%\n1.3 \n%\nThe following table presents operating income by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n$ change\n% change\nImpact of FX\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRMS\n$\n34,553 \n$\n27,544 \n$\n7,009 \n25.4 \n%\n3.6 \n%\nDSA\n123,153 \n126,436 \n(3,283)\n(2.6)\n%\n0.8 \n%\nManufacturing\n39,926 \n40,188 \n(262)\n(0.7)\n%\n2.7 \n%\nUnallocated corporate\n(63,833)\n(76,763)\n12,930 \n(16.8)\n%\n0.5 \n%\nTotal operating income\n$\n133,799 \n$\n117,405 \n$\n16,394 \n14.0 \n%\n2.4 \n%\nOperating income % of revenue\n13.3 \n%\n11.6 \n%\n170 bps\nThe following presents and discusses our consolidated financial results by each of our reportable segments:\nRMS\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n$ change\n% change\nImpact of FX\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue\n$\n213,474 \n$\n197,824 \n$\n15,650 \n7.9 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nCost of revenue (excluding amortization of intangible assets)\n148,004 \n137,906 \n10,098 \n7.3 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n24,934 \n26,453 \n(1,519)\n(5.7)\n%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n5,983 \n5,921 \n62 \n1.0 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n34,553 \n$\n27,544 \n$\n7,009 \n25.4 \n%\n3.6 \n%\nOperating income % of revenue\n16.2 \n%\n13.9 \n%\n230 bps\nRMS revenue increased $15.7 million primarily driven by an increase in large research model product revenue, notably from Noveprim and within China, and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nRMS operating income increased $7.0 million compared to the corresponding period in 2024.

Our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations supplemented by long-term borrowings. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources, are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table presents our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments: \nSeptember 27, 2025\nDecember 28, 2024\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents:\nHeld in U.S. entities\n$\n7,255 \n$\n4,219 \nHeld in non-U.S. entities\n199,842 \n190,387 \nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n207,097 \n194,606 \nShort-term investments:\nHeld in non-U.S. entities\n65 \n62 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n$\n207,162 \n$\n194,668 \nThe following table presents our net cash provided by operating activities:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n(in thousands)\nNet income\n$\n134,127 \n$\n239,038 \nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities\n448,690 \n324,110 \nChanges in assets and liabilities\n7,309 \n12,067 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n590,126 \n$\n575,215 \nNet cash provided by cash flows from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for (1) non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, goodwill impairment, debt financing costs, deferred income taxes, write downs of inventories, provisions of credit losses, long-lived asset impairment changes, gains and/or losses on venture capital and strategic equity investments, gains and/or losses on divestitures, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, as well as (2) changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. \nDuring the nine months ended September 27, 2025, our cash flows from operations were $590.1 million compared with $575.2 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by lower payments of variable compensation and favorable timing of payments to our suppliers and vendors, partially offset by higher purchases of inventory to support our DSA reportable segment.\nThe following table presents our net cash used in investing activities:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n(in thousands)\nCapital expenditures\n$\n(130,202)\n$\n(157,351)\nInvestments, net\n(6,907)\n(5,794)\nProceeds from sale of businesses and assets, net\n17,441 \n— \nAcquisition of businesses and assets, net of cash acquired\n— \n(5,479)\nOther, net\n3,154 \n(358)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(116,514)\n$\n(168,982)\n35 \nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nInvesting activities primarily consist of cash used to fund capital expenditures to support the growth of our business, purchases and sales of investments related to our venture capital and strategic equity investment portfolios, and asset and business acquisitions, periodically offset by cash from divestitures.\nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2025, cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from divestitures of certain site and business assets. Capital expenditures decreased for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, as a result of disciplined spend management in light of the global economic environment.\nFor the nine months ended September 28, 2024, cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by capital expenditures, an immaterial asset acquisition, and net purchases and sales in investments related to certain venture capital and strategic equity investments.\nThe following table presents our net cash used in financing activities:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n(in thousands)\nProceeds from long-term debt and revolving credit facility\n$\n1,070,861 \n$\n976,783 \nPayments on long-term debt, revolving credit facility, and finance lease obligations\n(1,141,500)\n(1,316,990)\nProceeds from exercises of stock options \n3 \n23,110 \nPurchase of treasury stock\n(360,577)\n(119,051)\nPayment of contingent consideration\n(21,822)\n— \nPurchase of remaining equity interest of other redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(19,140)\n(12,000)\nOther, net\n(12,687)\n(26,900)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(484,862)\n$\n(475,048)\nFinancing activities primarily consist of the proceeds and repayments of debt and certain equity related transactions including treasury stock purchases and employee stock option exercises.\nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2025, net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the following activity:\n•\nNet repayments of $60.5 million from our Credit Facility\n•\nTreasury stock purchases of $350.0 million associated with our stock repurchase program and $9.9 million due to the netting of common stock upon vesting of stock-based awards in order to satisfy individual statutory tax withholding requirements\n•\nPayment of $21.8 million associated with contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Noveprim\n•\nPayment of $19.1 million for the remaining 8% equity interest in Vital River\nFor the nine months ended September 28, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the following activity:\n•\nNet repayments of $346.2 million from our Credit Facility\n•\nTreasury stock purchases of $100.7 million associated with our stock repurchase program and $18.4 million due to the netting of common stock upon vesting of stock-based awards in order to satisfy individual statutory tax withholding requirements\n•\nNet proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $23.1 million\n•\nNet dividend payments to noncontrolling interest holders of $14.5 million\n•\nPayment of $12.0 million for the remaining 10% equity interest in an other redeemable noncontrolling interest\n36 \nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities.\nAmounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and our Senior Notes were as follows:\nSeptember 27, 2025\nDecember 28, 2024\n(in thousands)\nRevolving facility\n$\n665,472 \n$\n714,948 \n4.25% Senior Notes due 2028\n500,000 \n500,000 \n3.75% Senior Notes due 2029\n500,000 \n500,000 \n4.00% Senior Notes due 2031\n500,000 \n500,000 \nTotal\n$\n2,165,472 \n$\n2,214,948 \nThe Credit Facility provides for up to $2.0 billion of multi-currency revolving credit and has a maturity date of December 2029, with no required scheduled payment before that date. The interest rates applicable to the revolving facility are equal to (A) for revolving loans denominated in U.S. dollars, at our option, either the base rate (which is the higher of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (3) the one-month adjusted SOFR rate plus 1.0%) or the adjusted SOFR rate, (B) for revolving loans denominated in euros, the adjusted EURIBOR rate and (C) for revolving loans denominated in sterling, the daily simple SONIA rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio.\nOur off-balance sheet commitments related to our outstanding letters of credit as of September 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024 were $22.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate on a global basis and have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency. The principal functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan Renminbi, and Mauritian Rupee. During the nine months ended September 27, 2025, the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment we recorded as part of Other comprehensive income (loss) were the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, and Mauritian Rupee.\nFluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the value of our non-U.S. revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income as a result of a U.S. dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expenses, which will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally increase when reported in U.S. dollars. For the nine months ended September 27, 2025, our revenue would have decreased by $99.8 million, and our operating income would have decreased by $3.9 million, if the U.S. dollar exchange rate had strengthened by 10%, with all other variables held constant.\nWe attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy. We do not enter into speculative derivative agreements.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nDuring the nine months ended September 27, 2025, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $350.0 million under the stock repurchase program. As of September 27, 2025, we had $549.3 million remaining on the authorized $1.0 billion stock repurchase program. On October 29, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase authorization of $1.0 billion. This new authorization replaces the prior stock repurchase authorization of $1.0 billion that had $549.3 million remaining on the plan when it was terminated.\nAdditionally, our stock-based compensation plans permit the netting of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units in order to satisfy individual statutory tax withholding requirements. During the nine months ended September 27, 2025, we acquired\n \n0.1 million\n shares for $9.9 million through such netting.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial \n37 \nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nstatements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods, and the related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the application of our accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024 as filed with the SEC on February 19, 2025. There have been no changes in the Company’s critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 27, 2025.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements please refer to Note 1, “Basis of Presentation,” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other than as discussed in Note 1, “Basis of Presentation,” we did not adopt any other new accounting pronouncements during the nine months ended September 27, 2025 that had a significant effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q."
