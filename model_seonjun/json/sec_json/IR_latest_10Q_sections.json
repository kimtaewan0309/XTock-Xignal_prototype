Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nOur Company\nIngersoll Rand is a global market leader with a broad flow creation and industrial product portfolio across air, gas, powder, and liquid handling applications, providing services and solutions to increase industrial and life science productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. We manufacture one of the broadest and most complete ranges of compressor, pump, vacuum and blower products in our markets, which, when combined with our global geographic footprint and application expertise, allows us to provide differentiated product and service offerings to our customers. Our products are sold under a collection of premier, market-leading brands, including Ingersoll Rand, Gardner Denver, Nash, CompAir, ILC Dover, Thomas, Milton Roy, Seepex, Elmo Rietschle, ARO, Robuschi, Emco Wheaton and Runtech Systems, which we believe are globally recognized in their respective end-markets and known for product quality, reliability, efficiency and superior customer service.\nWe operate with two reportable segments: Industrial Technologies and Services and Precision and Science Technologies. See Note 19 “\nSegment Reporting\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a description of our reportable segments.\nItems Affecting our Business, Industry and End Markets\nGeneral Economic Conditions \nOur financial results closely follow changes in the industries and end-markets we serve. Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost, which can vary significantly based on geography and customer segmentation.\nTo date, 2025 has been marked by continued uncertainty in global markets, driven by investor concerns over inflation, elevated interest rates, ongoing political and regulatory uncertainty, including potential shifts in U.S. trade policy and the imposition of new tariffs, as well as geopolitical instability stemming from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nFurther contributing to economic uncertainty, the current U.S. presidential administration has signaled its intention to implement significant changes to U.S. trade policy, the size of the federal government and the enforcement of various regulations. These policy shifts could introduce additional market instability and reduce investor confidence. For example, the U.S. government recently announced tariffs on goods imported from various countries to the United States. Countries subject to such tariffs have imposed, or may in the future, impose reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs and other trade measures. We are actively monitoring the tariff developments and analyzing the potential impacts on our business, cost structure, supply chain and broader economic environment. We are identifying actions necessary to maintain competitiveness while we adapt to these new economic challenges. While these developments have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations to date, due to their evolving nature, and the expected persistence of macroeconomic conditions and volatility in the near term, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impacts they may have on our business and results in the future, but those impacts could be material.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nA significant portion of our revenues, approximately 55% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing facilities and labor force costs are outside of the United States, a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations\nKey factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below.\nAcquisitions\nPart of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary businesses that provide access to new technologies or geographies or expand our offerings. While acquisitions, as discussed further in Note 2, are not individually significant or significant in the aggregate, they may be relevant when comparing our results from period to period.\nSee Note 2 “\nAcquisitions\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further discussion of these acquisitions.\nRestructuring and Other Business Transformation Initiatives\nWe continue to execute business transformation initiatives. A key element of those initiatives are restructuring programs within our Industrial Technologies and Services and Precision and Science Technologies segments, as well as at the Corporate level. Restructuring charges, program related facility reorganization, relocation and other costs, and related capital expenditures were impacted most significantly.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nWe manage operations through the two business segments described above. In addition to our consolidated GAAP financial measures, we review various non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. We believe that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions.\nWe use Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of our operations. We measure Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities.\nManagement and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation. Such measures are provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures under GAAP. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation information.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment results section herein and Note 19 “\nSegment Reporting\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated within the consolidated results.

The increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions of $88.3 million, higher pricing of $49.4 million, and favorable impact of foreign currencies of $30.0 million, partially offset by lower organic volumes of $73.7 million. The percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 36.3% in the three month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to 36.8% in the same three month period in 2024.\nRevenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 were $5,559.7 million, an increase of $223.3 million, or 4.2%, compared to $5,336.4 million for the same nine month period in 2024. The increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions \n41\nTable of Contents\nof $344.2 million, higher pricing of $106.3 million, and favorable impact of foreign currencies of $30.1 million, partially offset by lower organic volumes of $257.3 million. The percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 36.9% in the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to 36.4% in the same nine month period in 2024.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 was $855.2 million, an increase of $40.2 million, or 4.9%, compared to $815.0 million for the same three month period in 2024, and as a percentage of revenues was 43.7% for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 and 43.8% for the same three month period in 2024. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to acquisitions. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to unfavorable cost leverage on lower organic volumes and tariff related pricing targeted to offset tariff cost increases one for one, partially offset by cost measures.\nGross profit for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 was $2,445.6 million, an increase of $91.0 million, or 3.9%, compared to $2,354.6 million for the same nine month period in 2024, and as a percentage of revenues was 44.0% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 and 44.1% for the same nine month period in 2024. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to acquisitions. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to unfavorable cost leverage on lower organic volumes and tariff related pricing targeted to offset tariff cost increases one for one, partially offset by cost measures.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses were $361.0 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $26.7 million, or 8.0%, compared to $334.3 million for the same three month period in 2024. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 18.5% for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 from 18.0% in the same three month period in 2024. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to lower organic volumes, partially offset by cost measures.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $1,082.2 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $69.5 million, or 6.9%, compared to $1,012.7 million for the same nine month period in 2024. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 19.5% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 from 19.0% in the same nine month period in 2024. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to lower organic volumes, partially offset by cost measures.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $94.9 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $0.1 million, compared to $95.0 million in the same three month period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, offset by businesses acquired in 2024 and first nine months of 2025 discussed in Note 2 “\nAcquisitions\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $277.8 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Amortization of intangible assets in the 2025 period increased due to businesses acquired in 2024 and first nine months of 2025 discussed in Note 2 “\nAcquisitions\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net was $23.8 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $5.6 million, compared to $29.4 million in the same three month period in 2024. The decrease in expense was primarily due to lower acquisition and other transaction related expenses of $8.9 million and lower foreign currency transaction losses, net of $7.1 million, partially offset by higher restructuring charges of $10.2 million.\nOther operating expense, net was $65.4 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $77.4 million, compared to $142.8 million in the same nine month period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the loss on asbestos sale of $58.8 million in the 2024 period that didn't recur in the 2025 period, lower acquisition and other transaction related expenses and non-cash charges of $28.5 million, partially offset by higher foreign currency transaction losses, net of $6.4 million and higher \n42\nTable of Contents\nrestructuring charges of $5.1 million. See Note 17 “\nOther Operating Expenses, net\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further discussion of the loss on asbestos sale.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $65.1 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $1.3 million, compared to $63.8 million in the same three month period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to the interest rate derivative contracts discussed in Note 13 “\nHedging Activities and Derivative Instruments\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The weighted average interest rate, including the impact of the active interest rate derivative contracts, was approximately 5.0% for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 and 5.3% in the same three month period in 2024.\nInterest expense was $189.0 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $37.6 million, compared to $151.4 million in the same nine month period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in long term debt primarily used to fund the ILC Dover acquisition and the interest rate derivative contracts discussed in Note 13 “\nHedging Activities and Derivative Instruments\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The weighted average interest rate, including the impact of the active interest rate derivative contracts, was approximately 5.0% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 and 5.2% in the same period in 2024.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net was $9.0 million and $9.5 million in the three month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from holdings of cash and cash equivalents.\nOther income, net was $35.2 million and $40.8 million in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from holdings of cash and cash equivalents.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $73.6 million, resulting in a 23.0% effective income tax provision rate for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, compared to a provision for income taxes of $73.8 million, resulting in a 24.4% effective income tax provision rate in the same three month period in 2024. The decrease in the tax provision and the effective income tax provision rate for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 when compared to the same three month period of 2024 is primarily due to a decrease in the pretax book income in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates combined with increased earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.\nThe provision for income taxes was $153.1 million, resulting in a 25.5% effective income tax provision rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, compared to a provision for income taxes of $174.3 million, resulting in a 21.6% effective income tax provision rate in the same nine month period in 2024. The decrease in the provision for income taxes and increase in the effective income tax provision rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 when compared to the same nine month period of 2024 is primarily due to nondeductible impairment of goodwill, tradenames, and equity investment and a lower benefit from a windfall tax deduction in the 2025 period compared to the 2024 period.\nNet Income\nNet income was $245.8 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to net income of $223.4 million in the same three month period in 2024. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.\nNet income was $320.4 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to net income of $614.4 million in the same nine month period in 2024. The decrease in net income was primarily due to impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets and the impairment of an equity method investment in the second quarter of 2025.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $11.9 million to $544.6 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to $532.7 million in the same three month period in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues decreased 70 basis points to 27.9% for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 from 28.6% for the same three month period in 2024. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher pricing of $49.4 million, acquisitions of $19.3 million, and the favorable impact of foreign currencies of $8.0 million, partially offset by lower organic sales volume of $32.6 million, unfavorable cost \n43\nTable of Contents\nproductivity and product mix of $25.4 million, and higher selling and administrative costs of $6.4 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to unfavorable cost leverage on lower organic volumes, tariff related pricing targeted to offset tariff cost increases one for one, and the decretive impact of acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $27.9 million to $1,513.7 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to $1,485.8 million in the same nine month period in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues decreased 60 basis points to 27.2% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 from 27.8% for the same nine month period in 2024. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher pricing of $106.3 million, acquisitions of $76.5 million, lower selling and administrative costs of $2.5 million, and the favorable impact of foreign currencies of $8.7 million, partially offset by lower organic sales volume of $114.6 million and unfavorable cost productivity and product mix of $51.1 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to unfavorable cost leverage on lower organic volumes, tariff related pricing targeted to offset tariff cost increases one for one, and the decretive impact of acquisitions.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income increased $0.9 million to $345.6 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to $344.7 million in the same three month period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher net income.\nAdjusted Net Income decreased $41.7 million to $964.0 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to $1,005.7 million in the same nine month period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense, higher income tax provision, as adjusted, and lower interest income on cash and cash equivalents.\n44\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSet forth below are the reconciliations of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income and Cash Flows from Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow.\nFor the Three Month Period Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Month Period Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet Income\n$\n245.8 \n$\n223.4 \n$\n320.4 \n$\n614.4 \nPlus:\nInterest expense\n65.1 \n63.8 \n189.0 \n151.4 \nProvision for income taxes\n73.6 \n73.8 \n153.1 \n174.3 \nDepreciation expense \n(a)\n28.2 \n28.2 \n83.4 \n77.5 \nAmortization expense \n(b)\n94.9 \n95.0 \n277.8 \n277.8 \nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\n— \n— \n265.8 \n— \nRestructuring and related business transformation costs \n(c)\n19.9 \n9.7 \n28.7 \n24.3 \nAcquisition and other transaction related expenses and non-cash charges \n(d)\n0.4 \n16.5 \n22.0 \n59.5 \nStock-based compensation\n14.9 \n15.0 \n45.8 \n43.6 \nForeign currency transaction losses, net\n2.8 \n9.9 \n15.6 \n9.2 \nLoss on equity method investments\n— \n4.8 \n127.1 \n19.0 \nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n— \n— \n— \n3.0 \nAdjustments to LIFO inventories\n5.2 \n— \n15.5 \n7.2 \nCybersecurity incident costs \n(e)\n— \n— \n(1.3)\n0.5 \nLoss on asbestos sale\n— \n— \n— \n58.8 \nInterest income on cash and cash equivalents\n(5.3)\n(8.0)\n(24.5)\n(35.7)\nOther adjustments \n(f)\n(0.9)\n0.6 \n(4.7)\n1.0 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n544.6 \n$\n532.7 \n$\n1,513.7 \n$\n1,485.8 \nMinus:\nInterest expense\n$\n65.1 \n$\n63.8 \n$\n189.0 \n$\n151.4 \nIncome tax provision, as adjusted \n(g)\n108.4 \n101.7 \n294.4 \n280.4 \nDepreciation expense\n28.2 \n28.2 \n83.4 \n77.5 \nAmortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets\n2.6 \n2.3 \n7.4 \n6.5 \nInterest income on cash and cash equivalents\n(5.3)\n(8.0)\n(24.5)\n(35.7)\nAdjusted Net Income\n$\n345.6 \n$\n344.7 \n$\n964.0 \n$\n1,005.7 \nFree Cash Flow\nCash flows from operating activities\n$\n354.6 \n$\n404.0 \n$\n856.7 \n$\n870.5 \nMinus:\nCapital expenditures\n29.1 \n29.7 \n98.1 \n113.8 \nFree Cash Flow\n$\n325.5 \n$\n374.3 \n$\n758.6 \n$\n756.7 \n(a)\nDepreciation expense excludes $1.4 million and $1.1 million of depreciation of rental equipment for the three month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and excludes $3.8 million and $3.1 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n(b)\nRepresents $92.3 million and $92.7 million of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions (customer relationships, technology, tradenames and backlog) and $2.6 million and $2.3 million of amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets, in each case for the three month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nRepresents $270.4 million and $271.3 million of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions (customer relationships, technology, tradenames and backlog) and $7.4 million and $6.5 million of amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets, in each case for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n45\nTable of Contents\n(c)\nRestructuring and related business transformation costs consisted of the following.\nFor the Three Month Period Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Month Period Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRestructuring charges\n$\n19.8 \n$\n9.6 \n$\n28.3 \n$\n23.2 \nFacility reorganization, relocation and other costs\n0.1 \n0.1 \n0.4 \n1.1 \nTotal restructuring and related business transformation costs\n$\n19.9 \n$\n9.7 \n$\n28.7 \n$\n24.3 \n(d)\nRepresents costs associated with successful and/or abandoned acquisitions and divestitures, including third-party expenses, post-closure integration costs, and non-cash charges and credits arising from fair value purchase accounting adjustments.\n(e)\nRepresents non-recoverable costs associated with a cybersecurity event.\n(f)\nIncludes (i) pension and other postemployment plan costs other than service costs and (ii) other miscellaneous adjustments.\n(g)\nRepresents our income tax provision adjusted for the tax effect of pre-tax items excluded from Adjusted Net Income and the removal of the applicable discrete tax items.

We also have the ability to seek additional secured and unsecured borrowings, subject to credit agreement restrictions.\nSee the description of these line-of-credit resources in Note 11 “Debt” to the consolidated financial statements in our 2024 Annual Report and Note 10 “\nDebt\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $2,600.0 million of unused availability under both the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and no event of default had occurred or was ongoing.\n48\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity\nA substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service requirements, and from the ongoing cost of operations, working capital and capital expenditures.\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,176.6 \n$\n1,541.2 \nShort-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt\n$\n1.4 \n$\n3.1 \nLong-term debt\n4,786.7 \n4,754.4 \nTotal debt\n$\n4,788.1 \n$\n4,757.5 \nWe can increase the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $1,000.0 million in the form of additional commitments so long as we do not exceed a specified leverage ratio. Our liquidity requirements are significant primarily due to debt service requirements. See Note 11 “Debt” to the consolidated financial statements in our 2024 Annual Report and Note 10 “\nDebt\n” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further details.\nOur principal sources of liquidity have been existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and borrowings under the Senior Notes. Our principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures, dividend payments, and finance strategic plans, including possible acquisitions. We may also seek to finance capital expenditures under capital leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity or favorable borrowing terms. We continue to consider acquisition opportunities, but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted. In the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, we may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional long-term borrowings. As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time, seek to repay loans that we have borrowed, including the borrowings under the Senior Notes. Based on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flow from operations, together with availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital spending requirements for the next twelve months and foreseeable future. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our Revolving Credit Facility or Commercial Paper Program in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our ability to do so depends on, among other factors, prevailing economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in control, we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures, or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices (including through Rule 10b5-1 plans), in privately negotiated transactions, a combination thereof or through other transactions. The actual timing, number, manner and value of any shares repurchased will depend on several factors, including the market price of our stock, general market and economic conditions, our liquidity requirements, applicable legal requirement and other business considerations.\nA substantial portion of our cash is in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We do not assert ASC 740-30 (formerly APB 23) indefinite reinvestment of our historical non-U.S. earnings or future non-U.S. earnings. The Company records a deferred foreign tax liability to cover all estimated withholding, state income tax and foreign income tax associated with repatriating all non-U.S. earnings back to the United States. Our deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2025 was $55.4 million which primarily consisted of withholding taxes.\n49\nTable of Contents\nWorking Capital\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nNet Working Capital:\nCurrent assets\n$\n4,163.3 \n$\n4,163.5 \nLess: Current liabilities\n1,925.6 \n1,818.9 \nNet working capital\n$\n2,237.7 \n$\n2,344.6 \nOperating Working Capital:\nAccounts receivable\n$\n1,429.3 \n$\n1,335.4 \nPlus: Inventories (excluding LIFO reserve)\n1,351.8 \n1,134.2 \nPlus: Contract assets\n128.8 \n111.2 \nLess: Accounts payable\n831.6 \n843.6 \nLess: Contract liabilities (current)\n341.9 \n318.6 \nOperating working capital\n$\n1,736.4 \n$\n1,418.6 \nNet working capital decreased $106.9 million to $2,237.7 million as of September 30, 2025 from $2,344.6 million as of December 31, 2024. Operating working capital increased $317.8 million to $1,736.4 million as of September 30, 2025 from $1,418.6 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase in operating working capital is due to higher inventories, higher accounts receivable, lower accounts payable and higher contract assets, partially offset by higher contract liabilities.\nThe increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of revenues in the quarter and seasonal changes in collection timing. The increase in inventories was primarily due to additions to support channel access, foreign currency translation, and acquisitions. The increase in contract assets was primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition and billing on our overtime contracts. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of vendor cash disbursements. The increase in contract liabilities was primarily due to the timing of customer milestone payments for in-process engineered to order contracts.\nCash Flows\nThe following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nFor the Nine Month Period Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nCash flows provided by operating activities\n$\n856.7 \n$\n870.5 \nCash flows used in investing activities\n(557.9)\n(2,872.8)\nCash flows (used in) from financing activities\n(726.6)\n1,782.7 \nFree cash flow\n(1)\n758.6 \n756.7 \n(1)\nSee the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section included in this Quarterly Report for a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $13.8 million to $856.7 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 from $870.5 million in the same nine month period in 2024. This decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in cash used in operating working capital in 2025, compared to 2024, an increase in interest payments for our Senior Notes, and an increase in pension contributions, partially offset by an increase in net income excluding non-cash adjustments, lower tax payments, and lower incentive compensation.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $98.1 million and $113.8 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net cash paid in acquisitions was $459.8 million and $2,759.1 million in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n50\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $726.6 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 primarily reflected purchases of treasury stock of $703.3 million, cash dividends on common stock of $24.0 million, other financing outflows of $5.9 million, and payments of deferred and contingent acquisition consideration of $6.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $12.8 million.\nCash provided by financing activities of $1,782.7 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected proceeds from long-term debt of $3,296.9 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $28.3 million, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt of $1,241.8 million, purchases of treasury stock of $198.2 million, payments of debt issuance costs of $32.3 million, payments of $19.9 million to settle certain cross-currency swaps, cash dividends on common stock of $24.2 million, and payments of deferred and contingent acquisition consideration of $22.6 million.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow increased $1.9 million to $758.6 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 from $756.7 million in the same nine month period in 2024 due to lower capital expenditures.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement has evaluated the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those estimates to be reasonable and appropriate. Certain of these accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on historical experience, trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates may be found in the section “Critical Accounting Estimates” of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in our 2024 Annual Report.\nEnvironmental Matters\nInformation with respect to the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims on us and our manufacturing operations is contained in Note 18 “\nContingencies\n” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We believe that as of September 30, 2025, there have been no material changes to the environmental matters disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information set forth in Note 1 “\nBasis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n” to our condensed consolidated financial statements under Part 1, Item 1 “Financial Statements” under the heading “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” is incorporated herein by reference.\n51\nTable of Contents"
