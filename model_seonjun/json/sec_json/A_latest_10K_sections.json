Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. Some of our service contract sales are processed by our digital commerce infrastructure. All channels are supported by technical product and application specialists to meet our customers' specific requirements.\nWe deliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, as well as a growing number of remote service delivery options. In addition to the traditional telephone support and on-site service, our teams remotely engage customers through various digital tools and omni-channel platforms. We also offer special industry-focused service bundles that are designed to meet the specific needs of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical, advanced materials, environmental and hydrocarbon processing customers to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.\nAgilent CrossLab Manufacturing\nOur direct service delivery organization is regionally based and operating in 28 countries.\nAgilent CrossLab Competition\nOur principal competitors in the services arena include many of our competitors from the instrument business such as: Danaher Corporation, PerkinElmer Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Waters Corporation, as well as numerous niche service providers. We compete on the basis of reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\n12\nTable of Contents\n            \nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, tax, treasury, legal, real estate, insurance services, workplace services, human resources, information technology services, quality and regulatory services, corporate development and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Generally, these organizations are managed from Santa Clara, California, with operations and services provided worldwide. As of October 31, 2024, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 1,900 people worldwide.\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organizations\nOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (“OFS”) focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering, logistics, and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.\n       \nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials,  Environmental, Regulatory Affairs and Human Capital Management include information common to each of our businesses.\nResearch and Development\nWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.\nBacklog\nWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.\nIntellectual Property \nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\nMaterials \nOur life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\n13\nTable of Contents\n            \nEnvironmental\nOur research and development, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws. We also maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\nClimate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems, disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements. Although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning, such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense.\nIn addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we strive to advance our sustainability practices. In 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  In 2023, we announced near and long\n \nterm greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\"). We also aim to provide transparency on our approach to sustainability management through our annual ESG report.\nRegulatory Affairs\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with FDA regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In Europe, the European Union has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (“EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical evidence requirements, quality management systems and post-market surveillance activities. The EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022.  \nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\nWe are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.\nIn addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR”), Brazil’s \nLei Geral de Protecao de Dados\n, China's Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning \n14\nTable of Contents\n            \nprivacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, with many such laws imposing significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\nWhile we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of October 31, 2024, we employed approximately 17,900 persons, of whom approximately 7,000 were based in the Americas, 4,400 in Europe and 6,500 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs. \nMission.\n Our instruments, software, services, solutions and people provide trusted answers to customers’ most challenging questions. Whether we are working with our customers to keep food supplies safe, improve the quality of air, water and soil, or fight cancer with more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments, our employees share a passion and commitment to advancing the quality of life. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to fulfill that commitment.\nEngagement.\n We engage with our employees through consultation, surveys, ad-hoc feedback and reviews. Our executive officers hold all-managers meetings on a quarterly basis to provide business updates and answer questions. We conduct an annual leadership survey that allows employees to provide feedback on leadership effectiveness, culture and job satisfaction. We have an open-door policy where employees are encouraged and empowered to bring issues to management’s attention. Employees have regular performance reviews with immediate supervisors. Employee sessions are held regularly to share business and market updates and answer employee questions.  \nDiversity and Inclusion.\n As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from providing managers transparency of their workforce pay equity to working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds. Agilent is committed to creating a diverse work environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. As of October 31, 2024, approximately 38 percent of our full-time employees were female. Approximately 50 percent of our board is comprised of directors representing underrepresented groups as of the date of this report. We have launched a number of company-wide initiatives including employee-network groups aimed at promoting engagement of traditionally historically underrepresented groups of employees. \nRetention\n. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. Our benefits are offered to eligible employees and comply with local legal requirements. We have a number of programs and policies designed to help employees in our diverse workforce manage their work and personal lives while meeting company objectives for business success, including flexible work arrangements, health and welfare benefits, employee and family assistance plans and parental leave.\nDevelopment\n. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development for current and rising managers. Training at Agilent takes several forms: face-to-face classroom experiences, on-the-job learning, virtual classroom events and self-paced e-learning. We are committed to providing an environment in which employees can expand their knowledge, develop new skills, and contribute their best work. Our culture of continuous development instills in our employees the behaviors that bring our values to life every day. We encourage our people to stay up-to-date on current research and technology while enhancing their current skills and growing new skills to meet future needs; we also put special emphasis on training managers at all levels to effectively communicate, role model and reinforce our values and culture.\nHealth and Safety.\n The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us.  Our environmental, health and safety (\"EHS\") management system provides a framework for assessing and managing risks relating to health and safety. We ensure managers and employees receive periodic workplace safety training and provide wellness programs that contribute to the productivity, health, and well-being of employees. In addition, our crisis management program includes a global tool that \n15\nTable of Contents\n            \nenables us to reach, locate and support employees in travel or in crisis areas. We regularly evaluate and review with senior management the performance of our programs and processes.\nCommunity\n. Each year our employees throughout the world devote thousands of volunteer hours to community service activities. Our employees may take up to six days of paid time off each year for volunteer activities with charities and organizations. We also support a giving program, which provides employees the opportunity to support a broad range of eligible non-profit organizations in their communities in the areas of health and human services, arts and culture, education and literacy, environment and conservation, and family and civic betterment.\nInformation about our Executive Officers \nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen, \n59, has served as our Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment and Supply chain since September 2013.

(\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.\nNew Segment Structure\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we announced a change in our operating segments to move our cell analysis business from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment in order to further strengthen growth opportunities for both organizations. Following this reorganization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab, each of which continues to comprise a reportable segment. We began reporting under this new structure with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2024. All historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. There was no change to our Agilent CrossLab business segment.\nAcquisition \n \nOn September 20, 2024, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of BIOVECTRA for total consideration of $915 million in cash. The acquisition expands our contract development and manufacturing organization. As a result of the acquisition, BIOVECTRA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, and the results of BIOVECTRA are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. \nSenior Notes\n2027 Senior Notes.\n \nOn September 9, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (\"2027 senior notes\"). The 2027 senior notes were issued at 99.866% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 9, 2027, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.20% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 9th and September 9th of each year and payments will commence on March 9, 2025.  \n2034 Senior Notes.\n \nOn September 9, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (\"2034 senior notes\"). The 2034 senior notes were issued at 99.638% of their principal amount. The 2034 senior notes will mature on September 9, 2034, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 9th and September 9th of each year and payments will commence on March 9, 2025. \nActual Results\nAgilent's net revenue of $6,510 million in 2024 decreased 5 percent when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements for 2024 had no overall impact on revenue growth when compared to 2023. Net revenue declined in our life sciences and applied markets and diagnostics and genomics segments, mostly in the pharmaceutical market, due primarily to the overall pressures on our customers' capital expenditure spending which continued in 2024. Revenue declines were partially offset by revenue growth in our Agilent CrossLab segment. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business decreased 8 percent in 2024 when compared to 2023.  Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in 2024 when compared to 2023. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business decreased 6 percent in 2024 when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in 2024 when compared to 2023. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 5 percent in 2024 when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in 2024 when compared to 2023. \nAgilent's net revenue of $6,833 million was slightly down in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements for 2023 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points when compared to 2022. Net revenue declined in our life sciences and applied markets segment, in the pharmaceutical market and in the Asia Pacific region primarily related to weaker demand in China and an overall pressure on our customers' capital expenditures compared to 2022. The net revenue decline was partially offset by revenue growth from our other segments primarily in Agilent CrossLab. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business decreased 3 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2023 when compared to 2022. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business decreased 1 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an \n33\nTable of Contents\n            \noverall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2023 when compared to 2022. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 8 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2023 when compared to 2022. \nNet income was $1,289 million in 2024 compared to net income of $1,240 million and $1,254 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net income in 2024 was impacted by cost-saving initiatives and higher interest income. Net income in 2023 was impacted by the asset impairment charges primarily related to the exit of our Resolution Bioscience business and lower tax expense. Net income in 2022 was impacted by higher sales volume partially offset by supply chain, logistics and inflationary pressures increasing our costs.  As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,329 million and $1,590 million, respectively. \n2021 Repurchase Program.\n   During the year ended October 31, 2022, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for $1,139 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2023, we repurchased and retired 661,739 shares for $99 million, excluding excise taxes, under this authorization. On March 1, 2023, the 2021 repurchase program was terminated and the remaining authorization of $339 million expired.\n2023 Repurchase Program. \nOn January 9, 2023, we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the \"2023 repurchase program\") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2023 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $2.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2023 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. The 2023 repurchase program commenced on March 1, 2023, and also terminated and replaced the 2021 repurchase program. During the year ended October 31, 2023, we repurchased and retired 3.9 million shares for $476 million, excluding excise taxes, under this authorization.  During the year ended October 31, 2024, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for $1,150 million, excluding excise taxes, under this authorization.

The 2024 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $2.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2024 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. The 2024 repurchase program became effective on August 1, 2024 and will commence upon the termination of our 2023 repurchase program.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. During the year ended October 31, 2024, we recorded the applicable excise taxes payable of approximately $10 million as an incremental cost of the shares repurchased and a corresponding liability for the excise tax payable in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. In fiscal year 2023, we recorded excise taxes payable of approximately $3 million related to shares repurchased in 2023 and paid the tax in 2024.\n \nDividends.\n During the year ended October 31, 2024, cash dividends of $0.944 per share, or $274 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2023, cash dividends of $0.900 per share, or $265 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2022, cash dividends of $0.840 per share, or $250 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. \nOn November 20, 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.248 per share of common stock, or approximately $71 million which will be paid on January 22, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2024. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.\nLooking forward, our primary focus remains on enhancing our customers’ experience, delivering differentiated product solutions and driving productivity improvements. While customer capital budgets continue to be constrained, we anticipate a gradual and steady recovery in the short-term. We also remain optimistic about the long-term health of our key end markets. Although inflationary pressures are uncertain, we will continue to mitigate their impact through targeted pricing strategies and various other cost-saving initiatives.\n34\nTable of Contents\n            \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\n. We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.\nWe derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606’’). Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. For products that transfer control over time, revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied. Product over time revenue is assessed against the following criteria: the performance creates an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created; the asset has no alternative use; and we have an enforceable right to payment. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.\nService revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. \nWe have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. \n Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the \n35\nTable of Contents\n            \naverage historical selling price of our products and services per geographic region for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract, and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.\nA portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement, the revenue associated with the lease component is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas the revenue associated with the non-lease component is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard.\nInventory Valuation.\n  Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates and assumptions about future demand, economic conditions and actual usage, which require management judgment. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of inventory levels, sales trends and forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory and to estimate and record reserves for excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. \nRetirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions.\n Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2024 and 2023, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2024, discount rates for the U.S. defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans decreased compared to the previous year due to the decrease in the corporate bond rates. For 2024 and 2023, the discount rates for non-U.S. defined benefit plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2024, mostly decreased compared to the previous year. If we had changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would have been approximately $1 million on U.S. defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans expense and $11 million on non-U.S. defined benefit plans expense for the year ended October 31, 2024. Lower discount rates usually increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates usually decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.\nThe company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. defined benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most non-U.S. defined benefit plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining future service period or remaining lifetime of participants depending upon the plan, using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. \nIn the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans were approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments as of October 31, 2024. Our Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation (excluding annuity contracts in the U.K.) ranges from zero percent to 60 percent to equities, from 38 percent to 100 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity and bond markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2024, may differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.\n36\nTable of Contents\n            \nEquity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. The annuity contracts are insurance buy-in contracts issued by a third-party insurance company to cover the benefit obligations of all participants under the U.K. defined benefit plan and are funded with existing pension plan assets with no adjustment made to the benefit obligations. Real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trusts and other similar real estate investments. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. \nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we had changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would have been $4 million on U.S. defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans expense and $8 million on non-U.S. defined benefit plans expense for the year ended October 31, 2024. The total net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $9 million benefit in 2024, $6 million expense in 2023 and $2 million benefit in 2022. These costs included a loss on settlement of $2 million, $4 million and $4 million, for the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.\n We assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.\nThe guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.\nIf it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. \nAt the beginning of fiscal year 2024, in connection with the change in our segment reporting, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of November 1, 2023, due to the change in our segment structure. As of November 1, 2023, there was no impairment of goodwill. \nIn fiscal year 2024, we again assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of September 30, 2024, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, there was no impairment of goodwill as of September 30, 2024. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n  Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the trade name acquired involves the \n37\nTable of Contents\n            \nuse of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. We value backlog using the discounted cash flows based on the estimated revenue from pending orders. We value license agreements based on the expected future cash receipts from license agreements, discounted to present value over the term of the agreement. We believe that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. \nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. As of October 31, 2024, we do not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $6 million in research and development in the consolidated statement of operations related to a project in our life sciences and applied markets segment.  There were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal years 2023 and 2022.   \nRestructuring.\n The main components of our restructuring plan are related to workforce reductions, consolidation of excess leased facilities and site closures. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable that the employees are entitled to the severance and the amounts can be estimated. Consolidation of facilities costs primarily consists of accelerated depreciation of right-of-use assets classified as held and used. In accordance with the accounting guidance, it was determined that certain assets had been abandoned, and an assessment was made of the remaining useful lives and potential alternative uses. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amounts of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.  See Note 16. \"Restructuring and Other Related Costs\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. \nWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate.  The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.  We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis.  If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for \n38\nTable of Contents\n            \nuncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAdoption of New Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.\nRestructuring and Other Related Costs\nSummary of Restructuring Plans.\n In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we announced restructuring plans that were both designed to reduce costs and expenses in response to macroeconomic conditions. These actions impact all three of our business segments. The costs associated with these restructuring plans were not allocated to our business segments' results; however, each business segment will benefit from the future cost savings from these actions. When completed, the restructuring programs are expected to result in the reduction in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over the three business segments.\nA summary of our aggregate liability related to both restructuring plans and the total restructuring expense since inception of those plans are shown in the table below:\nWorkforce \nReduction\nConsolidation of Excess Facilities\nTotal\n(in millions)\nBalance at October 31, 2022\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nIncome statement expense\n33\n \n13\n \n46\n \nNon-cash settlements\n(\n1\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n9\n)\nCash payments\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nBalance at October 31, 2023\n$\n31\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n36\n \nIncome statement expense\n75\n \n1\n \n76\n \nNon-cash settlements\n(\n7\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n8\n)\nCash payments\n(\n86\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n91\n)\nBalance at October 31, 2024\n$\n13\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n13\n \nTotal restructuring expense since inception of all plans\n$\n122\n \nNon-cash settlements include accelerated share-based compensation expense related to workforce reductions and accelerated depreciation expense of right-of-use and machinery and equipment assets related to the consolidation of excess facilities.

The plan includes a reduction of our total headcount by approximately \n500\n regular employees, representing approximately \n3\n percent of our global workforce.\nIn connection with the FY24 Plan, we have recorded restructuring expenses of $\n72\n million in fiscal year 2024.  The costs associated with this workforce reduction include severance, accelerated share-based compensation expense and other personnel-related costs. The timing and scope of the workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements.  While the majority of the workforce reduction was completed in fiscal year 2024, we expect to substantially complete the remaining restructuring activities by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. When completed, the restructuring program is expected to result in the reduction of approximately $100 million in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over our three business segments.\nA summary of the FY24 Plan activity is shown in the table below:\nWorkforce Reduction\n(in millions)\nBalance at October 31, 2023\n$\n—\n \nIncome statement expense\n72\n \nNon-cash settlements\n(\n7\n)\nCash payments\n(\n54\n)\nBalance at October 31, 2024\n$\n11\n \nTotal restructuring expense since inception of FY24 Plan\n$\n72\n \nNon-cash settlements include accelerated share-based compensation expense related to workforce reductions.\nFiscal Year 2023 Plan (\"FY23 Plan\")\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we initiated the restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and expenses in response to the macroeconomic conditions. The plan included a reduction of our total headcount by approximately \n400\n regular employees, representing approximately \n2\n percent of our global workforce, and the consolidation of our excess facilities, including some site closures.\nIn connection with the FY23 Plan, we recorded restructuring expenses of $\n4\n million in 2024 and $\n46\n million, in 2023. The restructuring plan expenses include severance, accelerated share-based compensation expense and other personnel costs associated with the workforce reduction. The consolidation of excess facilities includes accelerated depreciation expenses of right-of-use and machinery and equipment assets, and other facilities-related costs. The timing and scope of the workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements. While the majority of the workforce reduction was completed in 2024, we expect to substantially complete the remaining restructuring activities by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. When completed, the restructuring program is expected to result in the reduction of approximately $80 million in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over our three business segments.\n40\nTable of Contents\n            \nA summary of the FY23 Plan activity is shown in the table below:\nWorkforce \nReduction\nConsolidation of Excess Facilities\nTotal\n(in millions)\nBalance at October 31, 2022\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nIncome statement expense\n33\n \n13\n \n46\n \nNon-cash settlements \n(\n1\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n9\n)\nCash payments\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nBalance at October 31, 2023\n$\n31\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n36\n \nIncome statement expense\n3\n \n1\n \n4\n \nNon-cash settlements\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nCash payments\n(\n32\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n37\n)\nBalance at October 31, 2024\n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \nTotal restructuring expense since inception of the FY23 Plan\n$\n50\n \nNon-cash settlements include accelerated share-based compensation expense related to workforce reductions and accelerated depreciation expense of right-of-use and machinery and equipment assets related to the consolidation of excess facilities.\nForeign Currency\nOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities and equity are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in the year ended October 31, 2024 when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2023, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to 2022. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis.

For the year ended October 31, 2024, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the tax benefit of $47 million related to foreign-derived intangible income.\nFor 2023, our income tax expense was $99 million with an effective tax rate of 7.4 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2023, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the federal tax benefit of $104 million related to the realized loss on the divestiture of a business. The income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2023, also include the tax benefit of $41 million related to foreign-derived intangible income along with the tax benefit of $30 million related to the release of tax reserves in the U.S. due to the settlement of the audit with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for tax years 2018 and 2019.\nFor 2022, our income tax expense was $250 million with an effective tax rate of 16.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2022, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the tax benefit of $46 million related to foreign-derived intangible income.\nWe have negotiated a tax holiday in Singapore. The tax holiday provides a lower rate of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. The tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2030. As a result of the incentive, the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by $84 million, $54 million, and $53 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.29, $0.18, and $0.18 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nWith these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months. However, management is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in unrecognized tax benefits, if any.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.\n45\nTable of Contents\n            \nSegment Overview\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we announced a change in our operating segments to move our cell analysis business from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment in order to further strengthen growth opportunities for both organizations.

Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,751 million in 2024 compared to net cash provided of $1,772 million in 2023 and net cash provided of $1,312 million in 2022. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $314 million in 2024 compared to income taxes paid of $199 million in 2023 and $279 million, in 2022. For the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, other assets and liabilities used cash of $49 million, provided cash of $47 million and used cash of $8 million, respectively.  \nIn 2024, accounts receivable provided cash of $7 million, compared to cash provided of $132 million in 2023, and cash  used of $321 million in 2022. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 70 days in 2024, 69 days in 2023 and 68 days in 2022. In 2024, the decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable was primarily due to lower collectible sales compared to 2023. In 2023 cash provided in accounts receivable was driven by stronger collections compared to 2022. The change in accounts payable provided cash of $103 million in 2024, used cash of $171 million in 2023 and provided cash of $121 million in 2022. In 2024 the change was mainly due to less expenditures for direct materials as we continued optimizing our inventory levels and to timing of payments. Cash provided by inventory was $34 million in 2024 compared to cash used of $33 million in 2023 and cash used of $248 million in 2022. Inventory days on-hand decreased to 111 days in 2024 compared to 120 days in 2023 and 112 days in 2022. \nThe employee compensation and benefits liability used cash of $12 million in 2024 compared to cash used of $91 million in 2023 and cash used of $22 million in 2022. In 2024, the change was largely due to a decrease in variable and incentive pay compared to 2023. In 2023, the change was largely due to a lower accrual for variable pay compared to 2022. We paid approximately $105 million in 2024 under our variable and incentive pay programs compared to $185 million in 2023 and $201 million in 2022. \nWe made no contributions to our U.S defined benefit plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022. We contributed $20 million in 2024 and $21 million in 2023 and $17 million in 2022 to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, respectively. We did not contribute to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2025. We expect to contribute $19 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2025.\n        \nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,258 million in 2024 compared to net cash used of $310 million in 2023 and net cash used of $338 million in 2022. \nInvestments in property, plant and equipment were $378 million in 2024, $298 million in 2023 and $291 million in 2022. Our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 will be approximately $450 million. These continued investments in property plant and equipment are primarily due to the planned expansion of our manufacturing capacity for production of nucleic acid based therapeutics in Frederick, Colorado. Some of our investment may be eligible to qualify for reimbursement incentives, which will not fully be known until the expansion is substantially complete.  \n52\n In 2024, we invested $862 million primarily for our acquisition of BIOVECTRA and one other acquisition compared to $51 million for two acquisitions in 2023 and $52 million for our acquisition of Polymer Standards Service and advanced artificial intelligence technology in 2022. In 2023, proceeds from the divestiture of our Resolution Bioscience business were $50 million.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $752 million in 2024 compared to net cash used of $930 million in 2023 and net cash used of $1,372 million in 2022. Net cash from financing activities consisted primarily of cash flows associated with the issuances and repurchases of common stock, payments of cash dividends, borrowings and repayments under credit facilities and commercial paper, issuances and repayments of long term debt and payments of contingent consideration.\nTreasury Stock Repurchases.\n In 2024, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for $1,150 million, excluding excise tax liability of approximately $10 million compared to repurchases in 2023 of 4.6 million shares for $575 million, excluding excise tax liability of approximately $3 million which was paid in 2024 and 8.4 million shares for $1,139 million, in 2022. \nThe activity of our repurchases and remaining authorization by repurchase program follows: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRemaining\nShares\nCost\nShares\nCost\nShares\nCost\nAuthorization\nRepurchase Program\n(in millions)\n2021 Repurchase program\n— \n$\n— \n0.7 \n$\n99 \n8.4 \n$\n1,139 \n$\n— \n2023 Repurchase program\n8.4 \n1,150 \n3.9 \n476 \n— \n— \n$\n374 \n2024 Repurchase program\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n$\n2,000 \nTotal\n8.4 \n$\n1,150 \n4.6 \n$\n575 \n8.4 \n$\n1,139 \nThe 2024 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $2.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2024 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. The 2024 repurchase program became effective on August 1, 2024 and will commence upon the termination of our 2023 repurchase program.\nDividends. \n For the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash dividends of $274 million, $265 million and $250 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively.\n On November 20, 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.248 per share of common stock, or approximately $71 million which will be paid on January 22, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2024. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.\nShort-term Debt\nCredit Facilities. \nOn June 7, 2023, we entered into a new credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a $1.5 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on June 7, 2028, and an incremental revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. During 2024, we made no borrowings or repayments under these credit facilities compared to $360 million borrowed and repaid in 2023 and no borrowings or repayments in 2022. \nOn June 2, 2023, we entered into an Uncommitted Money Market Line Credit agreement with Societe Generale which provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of $300 million. The credit facility is an uncommitted short-term cash advance facility where each request must be at least $1 million. The interest rate is set by the lender at the time of the borrowing and is fixed for the duration of the advance. During 2024, we borrowed and repaid $215 million under this credit facility compared to $61 million borrowed and repaid in 2023. As of October 31, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nWe were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facilities during the year ended October 31, 2024.\n53\nCommercial Paper. \nUnder our U.S. commercial paper program, we may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.5 billion with up to 397-day maturities. At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under its revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. During 2024, we borrowed $1.19 billion and repaid $1.15 billion compared to $1.67 billion borrowed and $1.70 billion repaid in 2023, and $1.29 billion borrowed and $1.26 billion repaid in 2022. \nAs of \nOctober 31, 2024, we had \n$40 million\n \nborrowings outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of \n4.92 percent.\nOther Loans\n. In September 2024, we completed the BIOVECTRA acquisition and assumed two interest-free loans from the Strategic Innovation Fund (\"SIF\") in the amount of $20 million with $2 million recorded at fair value in short-term debt. The loans are repayable in quarterly and yearly installments at a weighted average imputed interest rate of 4.7 percent. In addition, we assumed two interest-free loans with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (“ACOA”) in the amount of $4 million with $3 million recorded at fair value in short-term debt. The loans are repayable in monthly installments at a weighted average imputed interest rate of 4.5 percent.\nLong-term Debt\n In 2024, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $1,197 million related to the issuance of our 2027 and 2034 senior notes.  Repayments of long-term debt of $600 million related to the full payment of the outstanding principal amount of our term loan. In 2022, we used the proceeds of $600 million from the term loan facility and repaid the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% 2023 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $609 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2023 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed.  In addition, $7 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid.\nTerm Loan Facility. \nOn April 15, 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement with a group of financial institutions, which provided for a $600 million delayed draw term loan that will mature on April 15, 2025. Loans under the term loan agreement bear interest, at our option, either at: (i) the alternate base rate, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans or (ii) adjusted term SOFR, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans. As of October 31, 2024, the term loan facility was terminated. \nOther Loans.\n In September 2024, we completed the BIOVECTRA acquisition and assumed two interest-free loans from the Strategic Innovation Fund (\"SIF\") in the amount of $20 million with $18 million recorded at fair value in long-term debt. The loans are repayable in quarterly and yearly installments through 2040 at a weighted average imputed interest rate of 4.7 percent. In addition, we assumed two interest-free loans with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (“ACOA”) in the amount of $4 million with $1 million recorded at fair value in long-term debt. The loans are repayable in monthly installments through 2029 at a weighted average imputed interest rate of 4.5 percent.\nSenior Notes\n.

We paid $65 million related to the achievement of a certain technical milestone associated with our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience and $7 million related to other acquisitions.\n54\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other\nOur liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.\nContractual Commitments\nOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.\nThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2024, for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions):\nLess than one\nyear\nOne to three years\nThree to five years\nMore than five years\nCommitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers\n$\n601 \n$\n40 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nOther purchase commitments\n128 \n8 \n— \n— \nTotal\n$\n729 \n$\n48 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nCommitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers.\n  We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.\nOther Purchase Commitments. \nWe have categorized \"other purchase commitments\" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under \"other purchase commitments\" were approximately $136 million. \nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2024, or October 31, 2023.\nOn Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2024 balance sheet (in millions):\nLess than one\nyear\nOne to three years\nThree to five years\nMore than five years\nSenior notes\n$\n— \n$\n900 \n$\n500 \n$\n1,950 \nOther loans - BIOVECTRA\n5 \n8 \n4 \n7 \nCommercial paper\n40 \n— \n— \n— \nInterest expense\n107 \n276 \n131 \n124 \nTransition tax\n41 \n51 \n— \n— \nOperating leases\n48 \n66 \n34 \n65 \nTotal\n$\n241 \n$\n1,301 \n$\n669 \n$\n2,146 \nOther long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 include $115 million and $162 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. Of these amounts, $64 million and $68 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts \n55\nwill be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. As of October 31, 2024, the remaining $51 million included in other long-term liabilities relates to the U.S. transition tax payment which is due within the next two years.",
