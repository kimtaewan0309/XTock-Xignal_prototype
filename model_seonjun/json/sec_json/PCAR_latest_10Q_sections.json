MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\n FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW:\nPACCAR is a global technology company whose Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. In the U.S. and Canada, trucks are sold under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates, in Europe, under the DAF nameplate and in Mexico, Australia and South America, under the Kenworth and DAF nameplates. The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. The Company’s Financial Services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing PACCAR products in North America, Europe, Australia and South America. The Company’s Other business included the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches through October 31, 2024, when PACCAR sold its industrial winch business.\nThird Quarter Financial Highlights:\n•\nWorldwide net sales and revenues were $6.67 billion in 2025 compared to $8.24 billion in 2024, primarily due to lower truck revenues, partially offset by higher parts and financial services revenues. \n•\nTruck sales were $4.38 billion in 2025 compared to $6.03 billion in 2024, due to lower truck deliveries, primarily in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico.\n•\nParts sales were $1.72 billion in 2025 compared to $1.66 billion in 2024, reflecting higher sales in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. \n•\nFinancial Services revenues were $565.3 million in 2025 compared to $536.1 million in 2024, primarily due to higher interest income driven by retail portfolio growth and higher portfolio yields. \n•\nNet income was $590.0 million ($1.12 per diluted share) in 2025 compared to $972.1 million ($1.85 per diluted share) in 2024.\n•\nCapital investments were $156.0 million in 2025 compared to $183.8 million in 2024.\n•\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $111.0 million in 2025 compared to $115.0 million in 2024.\nFirst Nine Months Financial Highlights:\n•\nWorldwide net sales and revenues were $21.62 billion in 2025 compared to $25.76 billion in 2024, primarily due to lower truck revenues, partially offset by higher parts and financial services revenues. \n•\nTruck sales were $14.85 billion in 2025, compared to $19.15 billion in 2024, due to lower truck deliveries in all major markets. \n•\nParts sales were $5.14 billion in 2025 compared to $5.00 billion in 2024, reflecting higher sales in the U.S. and Canada.\n•\nFinancial Services revenues were $1.64 billion in 2025 compared to $1.56 billion in 2024,\n \nprimarily due to higher interest income driven by retail portfolio growth and higher portfolio yields. \n•\nNet income was $1.82 billion ($3.45 per diluted share) in 2025 compared to $3.29 billion ($6.25 per diluted share) in 2024. In 2025, adjusted net income (non-GAAP), excluding a $264.5 million after-tax charge related to civil litigation in Europe was $2.08 billion ($3.95 per diluted share). See Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page \n52\n.\n•\nCapital investments were $549.0 million in 2025 compared to $567.7 million in 2024.\n•\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $339.3 million in 2025 compared to $337.6 million in 2024.\nPACCAR is finalizing construction of a new $92 million, 46,000 square-foot chassis frame painting facility which will increase capacity with robotic paint capabilities in Chillicothe, Ohio, to be opened in early 2026. PACCAR is also finalizing construction of a new $35 million, 50,000 square-foot engine remanufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi, to be opened in 2026. PACCAR will open a new 180,000 square-foot Parts Distribution Center (PDC) in Calgary, Canada, in 2026, to expedite parts delivery to dealers and customers in the region. In the third quarter 2025, Kenworth launched the T880S high horsepower vocational truck for heavy-haul, logging, and other high horsepower applications, featuring a set-forward front axle configuration to optimize weight distribution and bridge law compliance.\n\n\n- \n35\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nThe PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) group of companies has operations covering four continents and 26 countries. The global breadth of PFS and its rigorous credit application process support a portfolio of loans and leases with total assets of $23.02 billion. PFS issued $2.37 billion in medium-term notes during the first nine months of 2025 to support new business volume and market share growth and repay maturing debt.\nTruck Outlook\nTruck industry heavy-duty retail sales in the U.S. and Canada in 2025 are expected to be 230,000 to 245,000 units compared to 268,100 in 2024. Estimates for the U.S. and Canada truck industry heavy-duty retail sales in 2026 are in the range of 230,000 to 270,000 units. In Europe, 2025 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 275,000 to 295,000 units compared to 316,100 in 2024. The European truck registrations in the above 16-tonne truck market for 2026 are projected to be in a range of 270,000 to 300,000 units. In South America, heavy-duty truck industry registrations in 2025 are projected to be 95,000 to 105,000 units compared to 119,000 in 2024, and in a similar range for 2026.\n \nThe Company's truck and parts products have been negatively affected since March 2025 by import tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and actions taken by other countries. While the Company has taken mitigating actions to reduce the impact, the ongoing impact from import tariffs on truck order intake and profit margins remains unfavorable. The recently announced clarification of the Section 232 tariffs on medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which imposes a 25% tariff on imported trucks, is positive for the Company. The Company manufactures over 90% of its trucks for U.S. customers in its Ohio, Texas, and Washington State factories. As tariff policy, including the expected U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the International Emergency Economic Power Acts (IEEPA) tariffs, brings clarity to the market in the coming months, the impact could benefit the Company.\nParts Outlook\nIn 2025, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to increase 2-4% compared to 2024, depending on the economic conditions, including the effect of ongoing tariff uncertainty. In 2026, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to increase from 2025 levels, depending on the economic conditions.\n \nFinancial Services Outlook\nIn 2025, average earning assets are expected to increase 5-6% compared to 2024. The used truck market has been improving, which is reflected in PFS’ quarterly results this year. If freight transportation conditions decline due to a weaker economy, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current levels and new business volume would likely decline. In 2026, average earning assets are expected to be comparable to 2025 levels.\n \nCapital Investments and R&D Outlook\nCapital investments in 2025 are expected to be $750 to $775 million and R&D is expected to be $450 to $465 million. In 2026, capital investments are projected to be $725 to $775 million and R&D is expected to be $450 to $500 million. PACCAR is investing in next generation clean diesel and alternative powertrains, integrated connected vehicle services, expanded manufacturing capabilities, and advanced driver assistance systems that create value for customers.\n \nIn addition to the capital and R&D investments, the company plans to invest a total project amount of $600 to $900 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies.\nSee the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.\n\n\n- \n36\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nThe Company’s results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are presented below.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales and revenues:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,381.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,027.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n14,850.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n19,145.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,724.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,657.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,135.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,997.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n57.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck, Parts and Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,106.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,703.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,983.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,201.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n565.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n536.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,641.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,555.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,671.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,239.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n21,624.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25,756.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n102.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n630.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n776.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,349.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n410.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n406.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,253.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,276.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther*\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(339.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck, Parts and Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n526.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,041.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,689.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,630.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n126.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n106.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n370.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n331.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n108.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n258.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n290.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(153.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(284.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(499.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(961.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n590.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n972.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,818.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,290.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted earnings per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1.12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1.85\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.45\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6.25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter-tax adjusted return on revenues (non-GAAP)**\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n*   In 2025, Other includes a $350.0 million charge related to civil litigation in Europe (EC-related claims) in the first quarter 2025.\n** See Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for 2025 on page \n52\n.\n \nThe following provides an analysis of the results of operations for the Company’s three reportable segments - Truck, Parts and Financial Services. Where possible, the Company has quantified the impact of factors identified in the following discussion and analysis. In cases where it is not possible to quantify the impact of factors, the Company lists them in estimated order of importance. Factors for which the Company is unable to specifically quantify the impact include market demand and impact from tariffs, fuel prices, freight tonnage and economic conditions affecting the Company’s results of operations.\n2025 Compared to 2024:\nTruck\nThe Company’s Truck segment accounted for 66% of revenues in the third quarter and 68% for the first nine months of 2025, compared to 73% in the third quarter and 74% for the first nine months of 2024.\nThe Company’s new truck deliveries are summarized below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n% CHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n% CHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,100\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25,900\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(34\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62,300\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n84,100\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(26\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,100\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31,100\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33,100\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico, South America, Australia and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,700\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(48\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,900\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,200\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(26\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal units\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31,900\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44,900\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(29\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n111,300\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n141,400\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(21\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide new truck deliveries\n \ndecreased in the third quarter compared to the same period of 2024, reflecting lower deliveries in the U.S. and Canada and Brasil, partially offset by higher deliveries in Europe.

In the U.S. and Canada, market share is based on retail sales. In Europe, market share is based primarily on registrations.\nIn the first nine months of 2025, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the U.S. and Canada were 180,300 units compared to 198,600 units in the same period of 2024. The Company’s heavy-duty truck retail market share was 30.3% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 31.1% in the first nine months of 2024. The medium-duty market was 70,200 units in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 80,800 units in the same period of 2024. The Company’s medium-duty market share was 15.7% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 17.2% in the first nine months of 2024.\n \nThe over 16‑tonne truck market in Europe in the first nine months of 2025 was 218,300 units compared to 239,800 units in the first nine months of 2024. DAF over 16‑tonne market share was 13.6% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 14.0% in the same period of 2024.

loan and lease volume was $1.69 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.01 billion in the third quarter of 2024, and for the first nine months of 2025 was $5.06 billion compared to $5.45 billion in the same period in 2024. The decrease in new loan and lease volume was primarily due to lower new loan and lease volume from lower retail sales of PACCAR trucks and currency translation effects, mostly offset by higher finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales. The decrease in equipment on operating lease volume is primarily due to lower market demand in the U.S., partially offset by higher demand in Europe and Australia.\n\n\n- \n42\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 27.1% compared to 26.9% in the third quarter of 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 25.9% compared to 24.2% in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the third quarter of 2025 and in the first nine months of 2025 reflects higher share in all markets.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, PFS revenues increased to $565.3 million from $536.1 million in the same period of 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, PFS revenues increased to $1.64 billion from $1.56 billion in the same period of 2024. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by portfolio growth in the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and Brasil.\n \nPFS income before income taxes increased to $126.2 million in the third quarter of 2025 from $106.5 million in the same period of 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, PFS income before income taxes increased to $370.5 million from $331.6 million in the same period of 2024. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher finance margins from a higher loan and finance lease portfolio, and higher lease margins from operating lease portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for losses on receivables.\nIncluded in Financial Services, Other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $407.5\n \nmillion at September 30, 2025 and $396.5 million at December 31, 2024. These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees.\nThe Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $8.0\n \nmillion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $13.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, including $7.2\n \nmillion of losses on multiple unit transactions in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2024.

The increase in provision for losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in 30+ days past due accounts, primarily in Brasil and the U.S., retail portfolio growth in North America and Brasil, and higher expected losses.\n \nThe increase in charge-offs in the U.S. and Canada reflected a soft truckload market and included several large fleet customers, which were provisioned for previously. The higher charge-offs in both periods also reflected higher average loss severity in all markets, primarily due to normalizing used truck market values when compared to previous periods.\nThe Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms.\n\n\n- \n46\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nThe post-modification balances of accounts modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are summarized below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nAMORTIZED\nCOST BASIS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% OF TOTAL\nPORTFOLIO*\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMORTIZED\nCOST BASIS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% OF TOTAL\nPORTFOLIO*\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n241.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n324.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsignificant delay\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n235.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n167.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n250.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n189.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n726.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n680.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n* Amortized cost basis immediately after modification as a percentage of ending retail portfolio, on an annualized basis.\nModification activity was $726.2 million in the first nine months of 2025 and $680.8 million in the same period of 2024. The decrease in modifications for Commercial reasons primarily reflects lower volumes of refinancing, primarily in the U.S. The increase in Insignificant delay modifications primarily reflects an increase in customers requesting payment relief for up to three months, primarily in the U.S. The increase in Credit modifications for customers in financial difficulty reflects higher volumes of contract modifications in Brasil and Mexico mostly offset by lower volume of contract modifications in the U.S.\n \nThe following table summarizes the Company’s 30+ days past due accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico, Australia, Brasil and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nAccounts 30+ days past due was 2.1% at September 30, 2025 compared to 1.3% at December 31, 2024 and 1.2% at September 30, 2024. The increased\n \npercentage of past due accounts as of September 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024 is primarily due to higher past due accounts in the U.S., Brasil and Mexico. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.\n \nWhen the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $63.4 million of accounts worldwide during the third quarter of 2025, $40.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 and $18.5 million during the third quarter of 2024 that were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification.

The increase in pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due at September 30, 2025 for U.S. and Canada was primarily due to a modification granted to one large fleet customer in financial difficulty in the U.S. The increase in pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due at for Mexico, Australia, Brasil and other was primarily due to accounts modified in Mexico and Brasil.\n \n\n\n- \n47\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nA contract modification that improves the past due status generally reduces the probability of default. The effect of modifications is included in the Company’s historical loss information used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024. For certain modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties that are at-risk at September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024, and September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses is based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nThe Company’s annualized pre-tax return on average assets for Financial Services was 2.2% for the third quarter of 2025 and 1.9% for the third quarter of 2024 and was 2.2% for the first nine months of 2025 and 2.1% for the first nine months of 2024.\nOther\n \nIncluded in Other is sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment, as well as the Company's industrial winch manufacturing business through October 31, 2024. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 and 2024. Other SG&A decreased\n \nto $10.5 million for the third quarter of 2025 from $19.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. Other SG&A decreased to $55.5\n \nmillion for the first nine months of 2025 from $64.9 million for same period of 2024. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to lower salaries and related expenses.\nFor the third quarter of 2025, Other income before income taxes was $14.1 million compared to $3.6 million in 2024. For the first nine months of 2025,\n \nOther (loss) income before tax was $(339.6) million compared to $4.0 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to the EC-related charge in the first quarter of 2025, which is discussed in Note M of the consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment income for the third quarter decreased to $90.8 million in 2025 compared to $108.7 million in 2024. For the first nine months, investment income decreased to $258.5 million in 2025 from $290.0 million in 2024. The decrease in both periods is primarily due to lower investment yields from lower market interest rates in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by an increase in average investment balance, primarily in the U.S.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was 20.7% compared to 22.6% for the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting higher U.S. Federal R&D tax credits. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was 21.6% compared to 22.6% for the first nine months of 2024. Excluding the $350.0 million EC charge and its associated tax benefit, the adjusted year-to-date effective tax rate for 2025 was 21.9%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic income before taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n453.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n786.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,706.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,783.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign income before taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n290.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n469.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n612.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,468.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal income before taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n743.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,256.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,318.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,251.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic pre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign pre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal pre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \nFor the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, domestic income before income taxes decreased primarily due to lower Truck operation results.

The increased operating cash flow reflects lower net income by $1,471.1 million more than offset by higher cash provided from net income items not affecting cash of $339.1 million, primarily deferred income taxes, and higher cash provided from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1,208.3 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities are mainly due to higher cash provided by net changes in operating assets, primarily wholesale receivables on new trucks in the Financial Services segment of $1,552.3 million, inventory of $276.0 million, partially offset by a net decrease in accounts payable and accruals of $656.9 million.\nInvesting activities:\n Cash used in investing activities decreased by $1,241.9 million to $1,513.4 million in the first nine months of 2025 from $2,755.3 million in 2024. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities reflects lower net purchases of marketable securities of $557.4 million, lower originations on retail loans and financing leases, net of collections,\n \nof $515.7 million, and lower acquisition of equipment for operating leases of $170.2 million, partially offset by a net increase in wholesale receivables on equipment of $110.3 million.\nFinancing activities:\n Cash used in financing activities was $2,687.8 million for the first nine months of 2025, $1,921.4 million higher than the $766.4 million used in 2024, reflecting higher net borrowing activity and slightly lower cash dividends. Cash used in net borrowing activities was $590.0 million in 2025, $1,913.9 million lower than the cash provided by net borrowing activities of $1,323.9 million in 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, the Company paid $2.09 billion in dividends compared to $2.13 billion in 2024.\n \nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash increased cash and cash equivalents by $172.8 million in the first nine months of 2025, reflecting an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the British pound. In the first nine months of 2024, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, decreased cash and cash equivalents by $6.0 million.\n\n\n- \n49\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nCredit Lines and Other\nThe Company has line of credit arrangements of $5.69 billion, of which $5.26 billion were unused at September 30, 2025. Included in these arrangements are $4.00 billion of committed bank facilities, of which $1.50 billion expires in June 2026, $1.25 billion expires in June 2028 and $1.25 billion expires in June 2030. The Company intends to extend or replace these credit facilities on or before expiration to maintain facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the committed bank facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nOn December 4, 2018, PACCAR’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2025, the Company has repurchased $128.4 million of shares under this plan. There were no share repurchases made under this plan during the third quarter of 2025.\nTruck, Parts and Other\nThe Company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, R&D, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. Management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.\n \nInvestments for manufacturing property, plant and equipment in the first nine months of 2025 were $542.3 million compared to $562.8 million for the same period of 2024. Over the past decade, the Company’s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and R&D totaled $9.01 billion and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the Company’s premium products.\n \nIn 2025, total capital investments for PACCAR are expected to be $750 to $775 million and R&D is expected to be $450 to $465 million. In 2026, capital investments are expected to be $725 to $775 million and R&D is expected to be $450 to $500 million. PACCAR is investing in next generation clean diesel and alternative powertrains, integrated connected vehicle services, expanded manufacturing capabilities, and advanced driver assistance systems that create value for customers.\n \nIn addition to the capital and R&D investments, the company plans to invest a total project amount of $600 to $900 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies.\n \n \nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\") was enacted in the U.S. The most significant impacts to the Company of the OBBBA are the immediate expensing of domestic Research and Development expenditures and the permanent reinstatement of bonus depreciation for qualifying properties. The impact to the Company is the payment deferral of a significant portion of current federal income taxes and will have an immaterial impact to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nFinancial Services\nThe Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans.\nIn November 2024, the Company’s U.S. finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of September 30, 2025 was $7.60 billion. The registration expires in November 2027 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.\n \nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company’s European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had €550.0 million available for issuance under a €2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This program renews annually and expires in May 2026.\nIn August 2021, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10.00 billion Mexican peso program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores to issue medium-term notes and commercial paper. The registration expires in August 2026 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion Mexican pesos. At September 30, 2025, 5.80 billion Mexican pesos were available for issuance.\n\n\n- \n50\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn August 2018, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL Australia), established a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL Australia as of September 30, 2025 was 900.0 million Australian dollars.\nIn May 2021, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Ltd. (PFL Canada), established a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. There were no borrowings under this program as of September 30, 2025.\n \nThe Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Banco PACCAR S.A., established a lending program in December 2021 with the local development bank, Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) for qualified customers to receive preferential conditions and generally market interest rates. The program is limited to 2.61 billion Brazilian reais and has 1.00 billion Brazilian reais outstanding as of September 30, 2025. The Brazilian subsidiary also established a Letra Financeira (LF) program in May 2024 and the program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. A total of 500.0 million Brazilian reais medium-term notes were outstanding as of September 30, 2025.\nThe Company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, committed bank facilities and current investment-grade credit ratings of A+/A1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the Company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. In the event of a decrease in the Company’s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets. In such circumstances, the Company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its various sources of liquidity, including committed bank facilities, would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations.\n\n\n- \n51\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:\nThis Form 10-Q includes “adjusted net income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude a charge for EC-related claims. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAdjustment for the EC-related claims relates to a pre-tax charge of $350.0 million ($264.5 million after-tax) for estimable total costs recorded in Interest and other (income) expenses, net in the first quarter 2025.\n \nThe Company utilizes these non-GAAP measures to allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding a significant charge that is not representative of company performance.\nReconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted shares (non-GAAP) are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,818.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC-related claims, net of taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n264.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,083.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer diluted share\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.45\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC-related claims, net of taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.95\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC-related claims, net of taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter-tax adjusted return on revenues (non-GAAP) *\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC-related claims\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted effective tax rate (non-GAAP) **\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*    Calculated using adjusted net income.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**  Calculated using adjusted pre-tax net income.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n- \n52\n -\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:\n \nThis report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
