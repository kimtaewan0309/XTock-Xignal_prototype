Business \nOverview\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc. is a diversified financial services company with a 130-year history of providing solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware that primarily engages in business through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, references to “Ameriprise,” “Ameriprise Financial,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” may refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. \nWe are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice offering a broad range of products and services designed to assist individual and institutional clients achieve their financial objectives. Our strategy is centered on helping clients confidently achieve their goals by providing holistic advice and by managing and protecting their assets and income. We utilize two go-to-market approaches in carrying out this strategy: Wealth Management and Asset Management.\nWealth Management\nOur wealth management business is the primary growth engine of Ameriprise with a significant market opportunity. We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. In the United States (“U.S.”), the ongoing transition of baby boomers into retirement, as well as younger generations currently building their wealth and planning for retirement, continues to drive demand for financial advice and solutions. Our primary target market is households with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets. We are also well-suited to serve those outside this asset range as we also offer products and services designed for higher-net worth households. \nWe are an industry-leading wealth manager with a differentiated advice value proposition. Our network of more than 10,000 financial advisors (our “advisors”) is the primary channel through which we carry out our wealth management activities. Our capabilities are centered on establishing long-term personal relationships between clients and advisors. Through our affiliated advisors, we offer financial planning and advice, cash management and banking products, and full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients.\nOur branded advisor force is among the largest in the industry and is central to how we serve our clients. We support our advisors with an integrated technology platform, training, leadership and marketing programs to assist them in serving clients and growing their practices. Our nationally recognized brand, combined with these programs and other support, creates a compelling value proposition for financial advisors relative to the broader financial services industry. This is evidenced by our strong advisor retention and satisfaction and our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors. We continuously invest in, develop, and refine capabilities and tools designed to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction.\nWe design products and services as solutions for clients’ cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, retirement, protection, income generation and disbursement and estate and wealth transfer needs. The financial solutions we offer through our advisors include our own products and services as well as other providers’ products. We distribute our life and disability income insurance, as well as annuity products, through our advisor channel under the\n RiverSource\n®\n brand.\nAsset Management\nOur global asset management business, represented by the \nColumbia Threadneedle Investments\n®\n brand, offers a broad spectrum of capabilities to individual, institutional and high net worth investors. \nColumbia Threadneedle\n®\n \ninvestment products are primarily offered through third parties, though we also provide our asset management products through our advisor network, direct retail and through our institutional sales force. Our underlying asset management philosophy is rooted in delivering consistently strong, competitive investment performance.\nWe are positioned to grow our assets under management and advisement and strengthen our asset management offerings to existing and new clients. We benefit from key strategic relationships we have established and have a strong institutional presence. Our asset management capabilities are designed to address mature markets in the U.S. and Europe while expanding into new global and emerging markets. We have expanded beyond our traditional strengths in the U.S. and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) to serve more clients and gather assets worldwide. We continue to pursue opportunities to leverage the collective capabilities of our global asset management business in order to enhance our investment solutions and to develop new solutions that are responsive to client demand in an increasingly complex and competitive marketplace.\nHistory and Development\nOur company has provided solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives for 130 years. Our earliest predecessor company, Investors Syndicate, was founded in 1894 to provide face-amount certificates to consumers. In 1983, our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in connection with American Express’ acquisition of IDS Financial Services from Alleghany Corporation. We changed our name to “American Express Financial Corporation” (“AEFC”) and began marketing our \n1\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nproducts and services under the American Express brand in 1994. In 2005, AEFC spun off from American Express to form Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\nWe have grown both organically through the products and services we provide, as well as inorganically through strategic acquisitions. This has allowed us to significantly enhance the scale, performance, and product offerings of our brokerage, financial planning, managed accounts, retail mutual fund and institutional asset management businesses to best serve clients. Our acquisitions have included, among others, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings, H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc., J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated, Columbia Management, Investment Professionals, Inc., and, most recently, BMO Financial Group’s European-based asset management business. Beyond traditional acquisitions, we pursue other strategies to grow our wealth management business such as experienced advisor recruiting, practice acquisitions, advisor loans, and partnerships with banks and credit unions.\nOver the years, we have also sought to optimize the organizational structure in which we offer certain banking products. In May 2019, we converted Ameriprise National Trust Bank to Ameriprise Bank, FSB (“Ameriprise Bank”) to expand the products and services we provide directly to our clients. At that time, Ameriprise Financial became a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), and Ameriprise Financial elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. \nOur Business Mix and Integrated Model \nThe financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our operating segments:\n•\nAdvice & Wealth Management;\n•\nAsset Management;\n•\nRetirement & Protection Solutions; and                      \n•\nCorporate & Other.\nAs a diversified financial services firm, we believe our ability to gather and retain assets is best measured by our aggregate assets under management and administration metric. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.5 trillion in assets under management, administration, and advisement, compared to $1.4 trillion as of December 31, 2023. For a more detailed discussion of assets under management, administration, and advisement, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nWe continue to execute on our strategy to grow our Advice & Wealth Management business with complementary Asset Management and Retirement & Protection Solutions businesses. Our integrated model leverages key business linkages to drive growth and consistency across market cycles. The following chart shows our current business mix represented by the contributions of each segment to our pretax adjusted operating earnings (excluding Corporate & Other segment) as well as a historical comparison. \nOur Principal Brands\nOur diversified products and services are offered through our brands: \nWe use the \nAmeriprise Financial\n®\n brand as our enterprise brand, as well as the name of our advisor network and certain of our retail products and services.\nOur global \nColumbia Threadneedle\n®\n and \nColumbia Threadneedle Investments\n®\n brands represent the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (including its subsidiaries, “Columbia Management”), other U.S.-based entities and Threadneedle. The foreign operations of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. are conducted primarily through Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Limited, TAM UK International Holdings Limited and Ameriprise Asset Management Holdings Singapore (Pte.) Ltd. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, “Threadneedle”).\nWe use our \nRiverSource\n®\n brand for our annuity and protection products issued by RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”) and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York (“RiverSource Life of NY” and, together with RiverSource Life, the “RiverSource Life companies” or “RiverSource”).\nOur Segments - Advice & Wealth Management\nWe provide financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our financial advisors provide a distinctive, holistic approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both our and other providers’ products to help clients meet their financial needs and goals. Banking, lending, and cash management solutions help clients establish financial flexibility while planning for both short and long-term needs. As part of our goal-based approach to financial advice, our advisors help clients actively manage investing, saving and spending so they have a more complete financial picture. \n3\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nA significant portion of revenues in this segment are fee-based and driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net flows. We also earn revenue and income through other sources, including the following:\n•\nWe earn net investment income on owned assets from Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”) and Ameriprise Bank, both wholly owned subsidiaries of Ameriprise.\n•\nWe earn financial planning fees as well as transaction and other fees. \n•\nWe earn distribution fees for providing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues for providing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nOur Financial Advisor Platform\nWith more than 10,000 advisors, we are one of the top branded advisor platforms in the U.S. market. Advisors can choose to affiliate with us in multiple ways as noted below, and each option offers different levels of support and compensation. \nWe offer the following products and services through our Advice & Wealth Management segment: \n•\nFinancial planning and advice services to provide personalized financial planning and financial solutions for which we charge fees and may receive sales commissions for selling products that aid in our clients’ plans. \n•\nDiscretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts (also known as managed accounts) for which we receive fees based on the assets held in that account, as well as related fees or costs associated with the underlying securities held in that account. \n•\nBrokerage products and services for retail and institutional clients.\n•\nCash management and banking products, including brokerage sweep programs, cash management accounts, savings accounts, residential mortgage loans, credit cards, margin loans and pledged asset lines of credit.\n•\nFace-amount certificates through ACC. \n•\nMutual fund offerings from our Columbia funds as well as approximately 130 unaffiliated mutual fund families, representing approximately 2,125 mutual funds on our brokerage platform for which mutual fund families and other companies generally pay us a portion of the revenue generated from sales of those funds, administrative fees, and fees from the ongoing management attributable to our clients’ ownership in the fund.\n•\nInsurance and annuities products from both RiverSource Life companies as well as third parties, and we receive a portion of the revenue generated from the sale of unaffiliated products and certain administrative fees.\nOur Segments - Asset Management\nThrough Columbia Threadneedle, we provide investment management, advice and products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale.\nColumbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. \n4\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nRevenues in the Asset Management segment are primarily earned based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. As of December 31, 2024, our Asset Management segment had $681 billion in managed and advised assets.\nOur Asset Management segment also provides asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management and Retirement & Protection Solutions segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nManaged assets include external client assets and owned assets. Managed external client assets include client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the \nColumbia Threadneedle Investments\n fund families and the assets of institutional clients. Managed external client assets also include assets managed by sub-advisers we select but do not include client assets that we advise on a non-discretionary basis such as those assets where we provide voting recommendations and engagement services but do not manage the underlying assets. Our external client assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, although certain investment funds marketed to investors may be consolidated at certain times. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on consolidation principles and details regarding the consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). Managed owned assets include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (such as the assets of the general account, cash balances invested by Ameriprise Bank and from certificate products, and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of RiverSource Life companies) for which the Asset Management segment provides management services and receives management fees. For additional details regarding our assets under management and administration, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Management Capabilities and Products\nOur investment management business has a presence in 16 key markets globally, including France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S. \nOur investment management capabilities and products span a broad range of asset classes and investment styles to meet a variety of client needs with our $645 billion in assets under management diversified across geographies, strategies and clients as depicted in the graphic below. \n5\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nWe offer or make available the following products and services through our Asset Management segment with a range of investment strategies across these different vehicles and accounts:\n•\nU.S. registered funds through the \nColumbia Management\n family of funds, including retail mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and U.S. closed-end funds and variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) on which we earn management fees based on the underlying value of the assets and service fees.\n•\nNon-U.S. retail focused funds through Columbia Threadneedle, which include different risk-return options across regions, markets, asset classes and product structures, including retail funds that are similar to U.S. mutual funds (such as Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”) funds organized as Luxembourg-based investment companies with variable capital (“SICAVs”) and Irish and U.K. open-end investment companies (“OEICs”)). In addition, this also includes a range of listed Investment Trusts.\n•\nEuropean-based pooled investment funds designed for pensions, insurance companies and other institutional investors seeking solutions for liability or balance sheet asset management (“Liability Driven Investment” or “LDI”). \n•\nInstitutional and retail separately managed accounts for a range of clients, including pension, profit-sharing, employee savings, sovereign wealth funds and endowment funds, accounts of large- and medium-sized businesses and governmental clients, as well as the accounts of high net worth individuals and smaller institutional clients, including tax-exempt and not-for-profit organizations for which we receive management and performance-related fees.\n•\nOther separately managed accounts, including those offered through models that represent assets under advisement, for which we earn asset management fees based on model delivery assets under advisement. \n•\nManagement of owned assets such as assets held in the general account of our RiverSource Life companies, ACC and Ameriprise Bank. \n•\nManagement of CLOs, which includes providing collateral management services to special purpose vehicles that primarily invest in syndicated bank loans and issue multiple tranches of securities collateralized by the assets for which we earn fees based on the value of assets and performance-based fees.\n•\nPrivate funds of various types where we provide investment management and related services to private, pooled investment vehicles organized as limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or other entities for which we may receive fees based on the value of the assets or performance-based fees.\n•\nCollective funds and separately managed accounts sponsored by Ameriprise Trust Company (“ATC”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and offered to certain qualified institutional clients such as retirement, pension, and profit-sharing plans for which we receive management fees. \n•\nSub-advised accounts for certain U.S. and non-U.S. funds, private banking individually managed accounts, common trust funds, and other portfolios sponsored or advised by other firms for which we earn management fees and performance-based fees.\nDistribution\nWe maintain distribution teams and capabilities that aid the sales, marketing, and support of the products and services of our global asset management business. These distribution activities are generally organized into two major categories: retail distribution and institutional/high net worth distribution. However, alternatives and certain other areas have a level of specialized distribution.\nOur Segments - Retirement & Protection Solutions\nRiverSource solutions are available within the Ameriprise client experience and \nConfident Retirement\n®\n approach. We offer clients annuities, life insurance and disability income insurance products to meet their needs or current stage in life—whether that is covering essentials, ensuring lifestyle, preparing for the unexpected or leaving a legacy. RiverSource seeks to partner with our advisors to address clients’ goals and long-term needs at a differentiated level and provide a strong risk profile.\nRetirement Solutions\nThrough our advisors, we provide \nRiverSource\n annuity products to help clients address their asset accumulation and income goals. Our advisor network is the only distributor of new \nRiverSource\n annuity products, although our advisors offer fixed, variable, and structured annuities from selected unaffiliated insurers. As part of the continued evolution of the business model for our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment, we focus on the accumulation solutions clients want (such as the structured variable annuity, a registered index-linked annuity).\nRevenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on a contractholder’s benefit base, contract value or separate account values, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on general account assets supporting reserves for non-life contingent payout annuities, structured variable annuities, certain guaranteed benefits and fixed investment options offered with variable annuities, and on capital supporting the business. In addition, we receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate accounts to cover administrative costs and a portion of the management fees from the underlying investment accounts in which assets are invested. Revenues for our payout annuities with a life contingent feature are earned as premium revenue. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds. Intersegment expenses for this segment include \n6\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\ndistribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nProtection Solutions\nWe provide life and disability income insurance products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients. New \nRiverSource\n insurance products are exclusively offered through our advisor network. Our advisors also offer insurance products of unaffiliated carriers. The primary sources of revenues for our protection business are premiums, fees, and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and on capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of the RiverSource Life companies’ separate account assets supporting variable universal life investment options. The protection products earn intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for the protection products include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nProducts\nWe currently offer the following RiverSource Life products:\n•\nVariable annuities that provide returns linked to underlying investments of the contractholder’s choice of certain funds, as well as additional benefits, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (but without living benefits for new sales after mid-2022). \n•\nStructured variable annuities that use the performance of an underlying equity market index to determine earnings, subject to either a cap or floor. \n•\nVariable universal life insurance that provides life insurance coverage along with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the policyholder’s choice. \n•\nUniversal life insurance that credits interest at fixed interest rates. Universal life insurance may also contain product features that credit interest at a rate linked to an underlying equity market index.  \n•\nTerm life insurance that provides a death benefit, but does not accumulate cash value. \n•\nDisability income insurance that provides monthly benefits to individuals who are unable to earn income either at their occupation at time of disability or at any suitable occupation for premium payments that are guaranteed not to change.\nOur sales of \nRiverSource\n individual life insurance in 2024, as measured by scheduled annual premiums, lump sum and excess premiums and single premiums, consisted of approximately 96% variable universal life, 1% universal life and 3% term life. \nReinsurance\nWe reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our currently offered life and disability income products (as well as previously sold fixed annuity, fixed indexed annuity, life contingent payout annuity and long term care products) through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. We use reinsurance to limit losses, reduce exposure to large risks and provide additional capacity for continued product offerings. To manage exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties and on a periodic basis during the terms of the treaties. Our RiverSource Life companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on reinsurance. At a general level, we reinsure some or all of the following (with the closed blocks in our Corporate & Other segment):\nProduct\nReinsurance Type\nTerm Life and Disability Income\nCoinsurance\nUniversal Life & Variable Universal Life\nRenewable Term\nLife Contingent Payout Annuity\nCoinsurance\nFixed Annuity (closed block in Corporate & Other)\nCoinsurance\nLong Term Care (closed block in Corporate & Other)\nCoinsurance\nOur Segments - Corporate & Other\nOur Corporate & Other segment consists of closed blocks of business and net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses.\nClosed Block Long Term Care Insurance\nPrior to December 31, 2002, the RiverSource Life companies underwrote stand-alone long term care (“LTC”) insurance. We discontinued offering LTC insurance as of December 31, 2002. A large majority of our closed block LTC is comprised of nursing home indemnity LTC or comprehensive reimbursement LTC. Generally, our policyholders are eligible for LTC benefits if they become cognitively impaired or unable to perform certain activities of daily living.\n7\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nNursing home indemnity LTC policies provide a predefined daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home, subject to various maximum benefit periods, regardless of actual expenses of the policyholder. Our older generation nursing home indemnity LTC policies were primarily written between 1989 through 1999 and represent nearly one half of our policies. \nComprehensive reimbursement LTC policies provide a predefined maximum daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home and covers a variety of LTC expenses, including assisted living, home and community care, adult day care and similar placement programs, subject to various maximum total benefit payment pools, on a cost-reimbursement basis. Our second-generation comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies were written from 1997 until 2002. \nOur closed block of LTC policies was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Premium rates for LTC policies vary by age, benefit period, elimination period, home care coverage and benefit increase option. Premium rates are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience. In line with the market, we have pursued nationwide premium rate increases for many years and expect to continue to pursue rate increases over the next several years. In general, since very little of our LTC business is subject to rate stability regulation, we have historically followed a policy of pursuing smaller, more frequent increases in order to align policyholder and historic shareholder objectives but modified our approach in 2019 to seek larger increases as an additional method to manage our LTC business. We also provide policyholders with options to reduce their coverage to lessen or eliminate the additional financial outlay that would otherwise result. \nFor existing LTC policies, RiverSource Life has continued ceding 50% of the risk on a coinsurance basis to subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”) and retains the remaining risk. For RiverSource Life of NY, this reinsurance arrangement applies for 1996 and later issues only. Under these agreements, we have the right, but never the obligation, to recapture some, or all, of the risk ceded to Genworth.\nFor more information regarding LTC, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate & Other” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nClosed Block Fixed Annuities \nIn 2020, we discontinued new sales of fixed annuities and moved the Fixed Annuities and Fixed Indexed Annuities blocks to the Corporate & Other segment as a closed block. In this closed block, as of December 31, 2024, we have $5.7 billion of account value associated with our fixed annuities of which 89% has been ceded by RiverSource Life on a coinsurance basis to Global Atlantic Financial Group’s subsidiary Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (“Commonwealth”) under customary reinsurance arrangements with a comfort trust. For the ceded policies, RiverSource Life ceded 100% of the risk on a coinsurance basis. \nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive global industry. As a diversified financial services firm, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including registered investment advisers, securities brokers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies. We directly compete for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for our financial advisors and investment management personnel. Certain of our competitors offer web-based or mobile-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients, and we increasingly compete with various financial technology companies.\nOur Advice & Wealth Management segment competes with securities broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, financial planning firms, registered investment advisers, insurance companies and other banks and financial institutions to attract and retain financial advisors and clients. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain financial advisors include compensation structures, brand recognition and reputation, product offerings and innovation, growth opportunities, and technology and service capabilities and support. Further, our financial advisors compete for clients with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels. This includes wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisers and direct distributors. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain clients include quality of advice provided, price, reputation, advertising and brand recognition, product offerings, technology offerings for clients and advisors and service quality.\nOur Asset Management segment competes on a global basis against a substantial number of firms to acquire and retain managed and administered assets, including firms in the categories listed above. Competitive factors influencing our performance in this industry include investment performance, product offerings and innovation, product ratings, fee structures, advertising, technology and service quality, brand recognition, reputation and the ability to attract and retain investment personnel. Furthermore, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, “active” or “passive” investing styles), client interest in funds with particular environmental, social, or governance practices, client or regulatory requirements on use of client commissions for research, and downward pressure on fees may present various challenges to our business and could cause clients to favor certain competitors. The impact of these factors on our business may vary from country to country and certain competitors may have competitive advantage in certain jurisdictions. \nCompetitors of our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of variable annuity and insurance products include distribution capabilities, price, product features and innovation, hedging capability, investment performance, commission structure, reinsurance availability and pricing, perceived \n8\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nfinancial strength and financial strength ratings, claims-paying ratings, technology and service, advertising, brand recognition and financial strength ratings from rating agencies.\nHuman Capital Management\nAmeriprise Financial has a strong values-driven and inclusive culture that is the foundation of all that we do. While our individual business lines serve different client needs, we have a common vision and values that drive our business and how we work with clients and each other. \nOur values are the following:\n•\nClient focused;\n•\nIntegrity always;\n•\nExcellence in all we do; and\n•\nRespect for the individuals and for the communities in which we live and work.\nTo ensure our long-term success, we must continue to attract, retain, engage and develop a high-performing workforce. We are committed to providing an excellent employee and advisor experience for our global workforce. This includes approximately 13,600 employees, including our corporate employees and employee financial advisors. We have approximately 8,200 non-employee advisors who choose to affiliate with us through our franchise advisor group. \nLeadership skills and development of all our employees are core to our culture and history. We continue to invest in the development of our leaders and employees with a comprehensive and modern learning strategy to help them grow and achieve their career potential at Ameriprise. We work closely with leaders to prioritize organizational stewardship, leadership excellence and operating effectiveness as we executed our business plans.\nWe continually invest in our human capital programs and capabilities to ensure a highly competitive employee value proposition. We seek to offer a comprehensive and competitive total rewards program that supports our employees in their overall financial and personal health and well-being. Our total rewards programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate employees and align their pay outcomes to the achievement of the organization and business unit results, in addition to their individual performance. Weighing both individual goal achievement (the “what”) and leadership performance (the “how”) is critical to driving strong business results. We have a competitive total compensation approach that includes base salary, annual cash awards and long-term incentives, as well as a comprehensive benefits strategy for employees that focuses on physical, social, emotional and financial wellness. We have enhanced our employee value proposition and framework so that current and prospective employees better understand and appreciate the investments we make in them, including our culture, compensation and benefits, well-being, work environment and career development.\nOur Board of Directors engages in these topics and annually reviews our senior executive succession plans and broader talent development approach in support of our corporate strategy, and frequently discusses human capital topics at its meetings. The Board and the Compensation and Benefits Committee are regularly updated on topics impacting our workforce and dedicate time to reviewing and discussing our company culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, and engagement survey feedback.\nIn 2024, our strong corporate culture yielded the following results:\n•\nOur overall employee engagement remains strong at 84% favorable - exceeding external benchmarks with key strengths in the categories of integrity, leader effectiveness, respect, and client focus. Consistent with prior years, we had strong input with 93% of employees participating in the survey.\n•\nWe prioritize professional development, and in 2024, we introduced an enhanced learning curriculum to support leadership excellence across the firm. Over 90% of our global people leaders participated in these leadership development programs. In addition, we invested in a comprehensive modern learning platform for all employees to ensure they have access to relevant curriculum to help support their growth and career development, while still prioritizing our annual compliance training. \n•\nIn addition to recruiting talented professionals to join Ameriprise, we retained 95% of our high-performing employees. \n•\nWithin our advisor force, the retention rate among affiliated advisors who have been with us for more than 10 years remained strong at 94%. \n•\nWe have also continued to attract experienced, productive advisors, with 278 experienced advisors moving their practices to Ameriprise in 2024 and approximately 1,691 over the last 5 years.\nOur vision is to continue to foster an inclusive culture where everyone at Ameriprise can belong, grow and contribute to realize their potential and deliver value for our clients, community and shareholders. We ensure employees and advisors understand the goals and needs of our diverse client base and deliver on our value proposition to meet those needs. And we provide the tools, resources and leadership to support them. Our global workforce is comprised of 40% women and, among our U.S. based employees, 22% are ethnically diverse. In our Inclusion Index from our employee engagement survey, we achieved a score of 84% in 2024, which exceeds the industry benchmark.  \n9\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nOur focus on fostering an inclusive culture is also reflected in the policies and practices that promote a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace. Our 13 global business resource networks, with over 23,000 employee engagements, are open to everyone and provide opportunities for connection, community and career development, supporting business growth.\nIn an evolving and highly competitive industry, we have continued to successfully execute on our strategy while delivering solid performance, reflecting the strength and resiliency of our values-based, inclusive culture and the effectiveness of our human capital strategy.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, and patent registrations and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, we have established and registered, or filed applications to register, certain trademarks and service marks that we consider important to the marketing of our products and services, including but not limited to the \nAmeriprise Financial, Threadneedle, RiverSource, Columbia Threadneedle and Columbia Threadneedle Investments \nbrands. \nEnterprise Risk Management\nEnterprise risk management and our risk management program is an important component in how we manage our business. All operating subsidiaries of Ameriprise must comply with our enterprise risk management policy and framework, which: (i) establishes a structure for effective enterprise risk management, including oversight and governance; (ii) delineates key constituent roles and responsibilities; and (iii) imposes a number of core risk management processes. The enterprise risk management policy is designed to manage risks that may impact Ameriprise, including capital, credit, market, liquidity, operational, strategic, reputational, legal and compliance, and product. The enterprise risk management policy is supported by underlying risk policies at business units that provide further detail on the business unit’s risk governance, appetite, and tolerance. \nRegulation\nVirtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations provide broad regulatory, administrative and enforcement powers to supervisory agencies and other bodies, including U.S. federal and state regulatory and law enforcement agencies, foreign government agencies or regulatory bodies and U.S. and foreign securities exchanges. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations are significant and increasing, and the consequences for failing to comply may include civil or criminal charges, fines, censure, the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on or prohibitions from engaging in certain lines of business (or in certain states or countries), revocation of certain registrations and reputational damage. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our compliance and supervision processes, enhancing policies, procedures and oversight to monitor our compliance with the many legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business.\nWe operate in a highly scrutinized regulatory environment that remains subject to change. Regulatory developments, both in and outside of the U.S., have resulted or are expected to result in greater regulatory oversight and internal compliance obligations for firms across the financial services industry. We expect the current U.S. administration will seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different from that of the previous administration, impacting the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities of the federal regulators and agencies. In addition, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing and fiduciary initiatives, as well as environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) consideration and responsible investing; cybersecurity and resilience; the use of artificial intelligence; responsible information and data collection, storage and use; financial crime prevention; and privacy matters, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. For example, the enacted European Union (“EU”) Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Act and proposed U.S. laws on AI are likely to influence how financial services firms design, build and deploy products and services incorporating AI, and process non-personal data. States in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. continue to add new complexity to the patchwork of laws and regulations already in existence relating to privacy, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and other areas, and we expect this to continue at the federal and state level. Similar complexity resulting from multiple standards exists for retirement investing where individual states and federal regulators continue to propose or enact their own rules. These legal and regulatory changes have impacted and may in the future impact how we are regulated and how we operate and govern our businesses.\nThe discussion and overview set forth below provides a general framework of the primary laws and regulations impacting our businesses. Certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to one or more elements of this regulatory framework depending on the nature of their business, the products and services they provide and the geographic locations in which they operate. To the extent the discussion includes references to statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to these statutory and regulatory provisions and is current only as of the date of this report.\n10\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nAdvice & Wealth Management Regulation\nCertain of our subsidiaries are registered with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and with certain states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and are subject to the regulations of these organizations. The SEC and FINRA have stringent rules with respect to the net capital requirements (which includes rules around customer protection) and the marketing and trading activities of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as our financial advisors and other personnel, must obtain all required state and FINRA licenses and registrations to engage in the securities business and take certain steps to maintain such registrations in good standing. SEC regulations also impose notice requirements and capital limitations on the payment of dividends by a broker-dealer to a parent, and they have proposed regulations regarding cybersecurity programs and the public reporting of incidents impacting broker-dealers like ours.\n11\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nOur financial advisors are representatives of a dual registrant, meaning it is registered both as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and as a broker-dealer. Our advisors are subject to various regulations that impact how they operate their practices, including those related to supervision, sales methods, trading practices, information security, record-keeping and financial reporting. In addition, because our independent contractor advisor platform is structured as a franchise system, we are also subject to Federal Trade Commission and state franchise requirements. We continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding investing and financial advisors, including proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions around transparency and disclosure in advisor compensation and recruiting, identifying and managing conflicts of interest and enhanced data collection.\nThe SEC’s Regulation Best Interest standard of care became effective June 30, 2020 and the SEC continues to issue various statements and other guidance on complying with the regulation. Furthermore, several states have either issued their own best interest or fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may be limited to certain types of products (e.g., insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) finalized its voluntary exemption for providing investment advice to retirement account clients and has reinstated prior guidance for determining who is an investment advice fiduciary under pension regulations. The DOL finalized a new regulation expanding the definition of investment advice fiduciary, but that regulation has been stayed by the courts. While not a regulator, the Certified Financial Planner Board professional standards of conduct includes a fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Considering the various fiduciary rules and regulations that continue to be proposed, finalized, and sometimes withdrawn or amended, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule. \nOther agencies, exchanges and self-regulatory organizations of which certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are members, and subject to applicable rules and regulations of, include the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”). Certain subsidiaries may also be registered as insurance agencies and may be subject to the regulations described in the following sections.\nAsset Management Regulation\nU.S. Regulation\nCertain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act and are subject to regulation by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record-keeping, and operational and marketing restrictions. Our registered investment advisers may also be subject to certain obligations of the Investment Company Act based on their status as investment advisers to U.S. registered investment companies that we, or third parties, sponsor. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services in the U.S. through rules, regulatory priorities or general discussion. This trend is especially true globally where regulators remain active, including in Europe. Any future regulation could potentially require new approaches which increase our regulatory burdens and costs.\nMany aspects of the regulation that applies to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Asset Management segment. For example, Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and distributor for \nColumbia Management\n funds and other products. Additionally, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), the SEC’s best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL would be relevant to our global asset management business. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines.\nIn addition, certain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor and commodity pool operator and are also members of the NFA. In this regard, we are subject to additional registration and reporting requirements with respect to certain registered investment companies and other pooled vehicles that use or trade in futures, swaps and other derivatives that are subject to CFTC regulation.\nU.K. Regulation\nOutside of the U.S., Columbia Threadneedle is authorized to conduct its financial services business in the U.K. under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. A number of legal entities in the\n Columbia Threadneedle\n business are currently regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and one entity in the \nColumbia Threadneedle\n business is also regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). FCA and PRA rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance. As with the U.S. regulatory environment, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services. Key U.K. regulatory developments and trends include the following:\n•\nOperational Resilience:\n Under this new U.K. regulatory requirement, in scope firms must identify their important business services, which, if unavailable, could cause intolerable harm to clients, which they could not reasonably recover, or market disruption. The regulations introduce a new concept of impact tolerance and firms are also required to stress test their important business services and appoint a senior manager accountable for the regime.\n12\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\n•\nFinancial Resilience:\n U.K. regulators have revised the prudential regime applying to asset managers. This is being phased in over a five-year period and introduces a number of new capital requirements.\n•\nFCA Consumer Duty:\n The FCA recently introduced a new Consumer Duty that sets higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to retail consumers.\n•\nSustainability Disclosure Requirements\n: The FCA recently finalized new requirements that have started to take effect relating to new sustainability product labels, naming and marketing rules, additional ESG disclosure requirements both at an entity and product level, and an anti-greenwashing rule covering client communications.\n•\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n: The FCA recently launched a consultation on a potential new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in the financial sector. The consultation also incorporated additional proposed rules around firms’ handling of non-financial misconduct in the context of adherence to the FCA’s conduct and fitness and propriety regimes.\nOur U.K. asset management business must comply with local EU and country requirements as a non-EU firm, which includes leveraging our various EU-based affiliated entities (such as those in Luxembourg and the Netherlands) to provide services and marketing to EU clients and investors. We have an established fund range domiciled in Luxembourg (both UCITS and Alternative Investment Funds), Ireland and the Netherlands, along with Luxembourg-based and Netherlands-based affiliated management companies. Our Luxembourg and Netherlands affiliates may perform fund management, administration and distribution functions. Therefore, we are well placed to continue to serve investors in the EU. \nPan-European and Other Non-U.S. Regulation\nIn addition to the above, certain of our asset management subsidiaries and branches are required to comply with pan-European directives as issued by the European Commission and adopted by EU member states. Certain of these directives have impacted and will continue to impact our global asset management business. For example, certain of our asset management subsidiaries are required to comply with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”), UCITS, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“SFDR”) and the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Regulation (“PRIIPs”).  These requirements impact the way we manage assets and place, settle and report on trades for our clients, as well as market to clients and prospects. Similar to the developments in the U.S., we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services through international markets, including in the U.K. and EU where we have a substantial asset management business. These international rules, proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions may impact us directly or indirectly, including as a regulated entity or as a service provider to, or a business receiving services from or engaging in transactions with, regulated entities. In addition to regulations noted in this section, within the EU and the U.K. we have been and will continue to address regulatory reforms or structural changes including but not limited to: Consumer Composite Investments, Retail Investment Strategy, AIFMD 2.0,\n \nEMIR 3.0\n,\n SFDR 2.0, Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”). In addition , although the U.K. is not a part of the EU, the U.K. regulators may choose to implement future EU regulations and apply them in the U.K. potentially with significant variation from the EU regulations and potentially increasing the complexity and costs for our compliance with divergent sets of rules.\nColumbia Threadneedle \ncompanies or activities are also subject to various local country or jurisdiction regulations and to corresponding regulators in Europe, Canada, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, South America and Australia. With our growth in the EU, we have (and will continue to have) greater engagement with the Luxembourg, Irish and Dutch regulators. \nOther Securities Regulation\nACC is regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a registered investment company, ACC must observe certain governance, disclosure, record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements. Ameriprise Certificate Company pays dividends to the parent company and is subject to capital requirements under applicable law and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (“MN DOC”) (Banking Division).\nATC is primarily regulated by the MN DOC (Banking Division) and is subject to capital adequacy requirements under Minnesota law. It is prohibited from accepting deposits or making personal or commercial loans. As a provider of products and services to tax-qualified retirement plans and IRAs, certain aspects of our business, including the activities of our trust company, fall within the compliance oversight of the DOL and the Department of Treasury, particularly regarding the enforcement of ERISA, and the tax reporting requirements applicable to such accounts. ATC, as well as our investment adviser subsidiaries, may be subject to ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain ERISA clients.\nInsurance Regulation\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by states and other territories where they are domiciled or otherwise licensed to do business. These regulations impact our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment and our closed blocks included in Corporate & Other segment. The primary purpose of this regulation and supervision is to protect the interests of contractholders and policyholders. In general, state insurance laws and regulations govern standards of solvency, capital requirements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, premium rates, policy forms, the nature of and limitations on investments, periodic reporting requirements and other matters. In addition, state regulators conduct periodic examinations into insurer market conduct and \n13\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\ncompliance with insurance and securities laws. RiverSource Life Insurance Company is domiciled in Minnesota and regulated by the MN DOC and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York is domiciled in New York and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NY DFS”), and together with MN DOC are the “Domiciliary Regulators”. In addition to being regulated by their Domiciliary Regulators, our RiverSource Life companies are regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the states where each is authorized to transact business. Financial regulation of our RiverSource Life companies is extensive, and their financial transactions (such as intercompany dividends and investment activity) may be subject to pre-approval and/or continuing evaluation by the Domiciliary Regulators.\nAspects of the regulation applicable to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment and the closed blocks in our Corporate & Other segment. For example, RiverSource Distributors, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for our \nRiverSource\n annuities and insurance products sold through Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (“AFS”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and third-party channels. Additionally, ERISA, the SEC’s best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL are relevant to our insurance and annuities business or products. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines.\nAll states require participation in insurance guaranty associations, which assess fees (subject to statutory limits) to insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders and contractholders of insolvent insurance companies. These assessments are generally based on a member insurer’s proportionate share of all premiums written by member insurers in the state during a specified period prior to an insurer’s insolvency. See Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding guaranty association assessments.\nCertain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by the RiverSource Life companies, and certain separate accounts supporting such contracts, constitute and are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As such, these products are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. \nThe Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Department of Treasury does not have substantive regulatory responsibilities, though it is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry and the effectiveness of its regulatory framework in addition to providing periodic reports to the President of the U.S. and Congress. We monitor the FIO’s activity to identify and assess emerging regulatory priorities with potential application to our business.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements designed to assess the adequacy of an insurance company’s total adjusted capital in relation to its investment, insurance and other risks. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has established RBC standards that all state insurance departments have adopted. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. The NAIC RBC report is completed as of December 31 and filed annually, along with the statutory financial statements. \nOur RiverSource Life companies would be subject to various levels of regulatory intervention if their total adjusted statutory capital falls below defined RBC action levels. At the “company action level,” defined as total adjusted capital level between 100% and 75% of the RBC requirement, an insurer must submit a plan for corrective action with its primary state regulator. The level of regulatory intervention is greater at lower levels of total adjusted capital relative to the RBC requirement. \nRiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of NY maintain capital levels well in excess of the company action level required by state insurance regulators as noted below as of December 31, 2024:\nEntity\nCompany Action Level RBC\nTotal Adjusted Capital\n% of Company Action Level RBC\n(in millions, except percentages)\nRiverSource Life\n$\n489 \n$\n2,700 \n552 \n%\nRiverSource Life of NY\n38 \n219 \n579 \n%\nAmeriprise Financial, as a direct and indirect owner of its insurance subsidiaries, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of Minnesota and New York (the states where its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled). These laws generally require insurance holding companies to register with the insurance department of the insurance company’s state of domicile and to provide certain financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company structure.\nAs part of its Solvency Modernization Initiative, in 2010 the NAIC adopted revisions to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (“Holding Company Act”) to enhance insurer group supervision and create a new Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act. The Holding Company Act revisions focus on the overall insurance holding company system, establish a framework of regulator supervisory colleges, enhancements to corporate governance, and require the annual filing of an Enterprise Risk Management Report. The ORSA Model Act requires that an insurer create and file, annually, its ORSA, which is a complete self-assessment of its risk management functions and capital adequacy. These laws were enacted by the  \n14\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nDomiciliary Regulators. We complete and file these reports as required by the laws and regulations of those states. Insurance regulation and supervision also goes beyond direct regulation of our insurance companies in other ways.  For example, while we are now subject to the FRB’s “Building Block Approach” (discussed below in more detail), once Minnesota implements the NAIC’s “Group Capital Calculation,” a new capital calculation will exist for many insurance companies like ours that are not subject to the FRB regulation as we are. And from time to time, we must report other enterprise activities to our state insurance regulators (such as the NAIC’s Liquidity Stress Testing Framework).\nFederal Banking and Financial Holding Company Regulation\nAmeriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), which is the primary regulator of federal savings banks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in its role as insurer of Ameriprise Bank's deposits. As a federally chartered savings bank, Ameriprise Bank is subject to numerous rules and regulations governing all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices and transactions with affiliates. Ameriprise Bank is also subject to specific capital rules and limits on capital distributions, including payment of dividends. If Ameriprise Bank's capital falls below certain levels, the OCC would be required to take remedial actions and could take other actions, including imposing further limits on dividends or business activities. In addition, an array of Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), fair lending and other consumer protection laws and regulations apply to Ameriprise Bank. \nAs the controlling company of Ameriprise Bank, Ameriprise Financial is a savings and loan holding company that is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. Ameriprise Financial has elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). Further, FRB regulation and supervisory oversight of Ameriprise Financial includes examinations, regular financial reporting, and prudential standards, such as capital, liquidity risk management, and parameters for business conduct and internal governance.\nUnder the Bank Holding Company Act, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking, and going beyond these activities would require a conformance period request from the FRB. As a financial holding company, we may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of either a bank holding company (or a bank) without the prior approval of the FRB or of a non-financial company absent an available exemption.\nIn order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, Ameriprise Bank, as our sole insured depository institution subsidiary, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulations, and must receive at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the CRA. In addition, Ameriprise, as a financial holding company, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the violation and any agreement then reached with the FRB, Ameriprise Financial could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those generally permissible for bank holding companies until such violation is cured.\nWe are subject to what is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits “banking entities,” including Ameriprise and our affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, asset management, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with “covered funds,” with a number of exemptions and exclusions. It also requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule.\nAmeriprise Financial reports to the FRB under a consolidated capital framework termed the “Building Block Approach” (“BBA”) for savings and loan holding companies that are significantly engaged in insurance activities (commonly referred to as insurance savings and loan holding companies). In general, under the rule, insurance savings and loan holding companies like us are required to aggregate state-based insurance capital requirements with banking capital requirements for non-insurance businesses to satisfy specific minimum total requirements and hold an additional capital conservation buffer. The ratio of the amount of available capital to the capital requirement amount is referred to as the BBA ratio and is subject to a 250% minimum, effective January 1, 2024. An additional capital conservation buffer of 150% will be effective as of December 31, 2025, for a total capital requirement of at least 400%.\nThe BBA available capital, BBA capital requirement, and BBA ratio as of December 31, 2024  are as follows:\n(in millions, except percentages)\nBBA available capital\n$\n3,833 \nBBA capital requirement\n392 \nBBA ratio\n978 \n%\n15\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nAdditional Parent Company Regulation and Other Regulation\nWe are a publicly traded company subject to SEC and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules and regulation and have operations in a number of geographical regions across the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Certain states enact regulations or requirements that can drive enterprise-wide action or disclosures. We evaluate these laws and changes to understand if and when they impact our business, such as the laws in California requiring certain climate-related disclosure. As an international company, we continuously monitor developments in EU legislation, as well as in the other markets in which we operate, to ensure that we comply with all applicable legal requirements, including EU directives applicable to financial institutions as implemented in the various member states. Because of the mix of business activities we conduct, we assess the impact of, and monitor our status under, the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive, which contemplates global supervision and prudential regulation of certain financial conglomerates involved in banking, insurance and investment activities. \nPrivacy, Environmental and Anti-Money Laundering Laws \nMany aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive legal requirements concerning the use and protection of personal information, including client and employee information, from a multitude of different functional regulators and law enforcement bodies. This includes rules adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, an ever increasing number of state laws and regulations such as the NY DFS’ Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, and California privacy legislation, as recently amended, EU data protection legislation, known as the Global Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as implemented in the respective EU member states, the U.K. Data Protection Act, 2018 and U.K. GDPR, and data protection rules in other regions in which we operate outside the U.S. and the EU. We have also implemented policies and procedures in response to such requirements. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable laws and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft or other improper use or disclosure of personal information, while seeking to collect only the data that is necessary to properly achieve our business objectives and best serve our clients. To the extent we do experience an incident, we have developed and implemented a cybersecurity incident response manual, which we regularly exercise and update, as appropriate.\nAs the owner and operator of real property, we are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. We periodically conduct certain air and water reviews on our own real estate as well as investment real estate to assess and support our compliance with these laws and regulations.\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the USA Patriot Act, was enacted in October 2001. It substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the U.S. In response, we enhanced our existing anti-money laundering programs and developed new procedures and programs, including enhancing our “know your customer” and “due diligence” programs. We continuously review, update and enhance our anti-money laundering procedures and programs. In addition, we will continue to comply with anti-money laundering legislation in the U.K. derived from applicable EU directives and international initiatives adopted in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nExchange Act Reports and Additional Information\nWe maintain an Investor Relations website at ir.ameriprise.com. Investors can also access the website through our main website at ameriprise.com by clicking on the “Investor Relations” link located at the bottom of our homepage (ameriprise.com). We use our Investor Relations website to announce financial and other information to investors and to make available SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, other communications and webcasts. Investors and others interested in the Company are encouraged to visit the Investor Relations website from time to time, as information is frequently updated and posted. Additionally, users can sign up to receive automatic notifications when new materials are posted.

  "item7": "Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  \nThe following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the “Forward-Looking Statements,” our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes that follow and the “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to “Ameriprise Financial,” “Ameriprise,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries.\nOverview\nAmeriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a 130-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $1.5 trillion in assets under management, administration, and advisement as of December 31, 2024. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients’ financial objectives. For additional discussion of our businesses, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.\nWe operate our business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around us, including the global and U.S. economies,  changes in interest and inflation rates, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, geopolitical strain, pandemics, the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Risk Factors” - and other factors as discussed herein.\nEquity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the values of market risk benefits and embedded derivatives associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the “spread” income generated on our deposit products, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and fixed deferred annuities. We have been operating in a historically low interest rate environment but have recently experienced a substantial increase in rates with uncertainty about where rates will go in the future. A higher (lower) interest rate environment may result in decreases (increases) to our long-duration contract reserves, which may impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nIn the third quarter, we conducted our annual review of life insurance, annuity and long term care (“LTC”) valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These annual assumption updates are collectively referred to as unlocking throughout this document. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking.\nThe following discussion includes a comparison of our 2024 and 2023 results. For a discussion of our 2022 results and for a comparison of results for 2023 and 2022, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.\nWe consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in Net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the Management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. \nWhile our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the  reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life (“UL”) insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable annuity and variable universal life (“VUL”) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; \n32\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nincome (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis.\nThe market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosure\ns, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of our life insurance subsidiaries’ nonperformance spread.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. \nConcurrent with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12, \nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\n, management no longer excludes adjustments for deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) and unearned revenue amortization from adjusted operating earnings measures. Amortization of DAC, DSIC, and unearned revenue is no longer impacted by markets and is now amortized on a constant-level basis in accordance with GAAP.\nIt is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.\nOur financial targets are:\n•\nAdjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and \n•\nAdjusted operating return on equity of over 30%.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP measures to adjusted operating measures:\nPer Diluted Share\n \nYears Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income\n$\n3,401 \n$\n2,556 \n$\n33.05 \n$\n23.71 \nLess Adjustments:\nNet realized investment gains (losses) \n(1)\n(21)\n(32)\n(0.20)\n(0.30)\nMarket impact on non-traditional long-duration products \n(1)\n(153)\n(608)\n(1.49)\n(5.63)\nMean reversion related impacts \n(1)\n1 \n— \n0.01 \n— \nIntegration/restructuring charges \n(1)\n— \n(62)\n— \n(0.58)\nNet income (loss) attributable to CIEs\n3 \n— \n0.03 \n— \nTax effect of adjustments \n(2)\n36 \n147 \n0.35 \n1.36 \nAdjusted operating earnings\n$\n3,535 \n$\n3,111 \n$\n34.35 \n$\n28.86 \nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\n \n \n \n \nBasic\n101.0 \n105.7 \n \n \nDiluted\n102.9 \n107.8 \n \n \n(1)\n Pretax adjusted operating adjustments.\n(2)\n Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21%.\n33\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nThe following table reconciles net income to adjusted operating earnings and the five-point average of quarter-end equity to adjusted operating equity:\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nNet income\n$\n3,401 \n$\n2,556 \nLess: Adjustments \n(1)\n(134)\n(555)\nAdjusted operating earnings\n$\n3,535 \n$\n3,111 \nTotal Ameriprise Financial, Inc. shareholders’ equity\n$\n5,109 \n$\n4,116 \nLess: AOCI, net of tax\n(1,739)\n(2,297)\nTotal Ameriprise Financial, Inc. shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI\n6,848 \n6,413 \nLess: Equity impacts attributable to CIEs\n(3)\n(4)\nAdjusted operating equity\n$\n6,851 \n$\n6,417 \nReturn on equity, excluding AOCI\n49.7 \n%\n39.9 \n%\nAdjusted operating return on equity, excluding AOCI\n (2)\n51.6 \n%\n48.5 \n%\n(1) \nAdjustments reflect the sum of after-tax net realized investment gains/losses, net of the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts; block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and net income (loss) from consolidated investment entities.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 21%.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our accounting policies.\nValuation of Investments\nThe most significant component of our investments is our Available-for-Sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the fair value of our Available-for-Sale securities. Financial markets are subject to significant movements in valuation and liquidity, which can impact our ability to liquidate and the selling price that can be realized for our securities and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments. We are unable to predict impacts and determine sensitivities in reported amounts reflecting such market movements on our aggregate Available-for-Sale portfolio. Changes to these assumptions do not occur in isolation and it is impracticable to predict such impacts at the individual security unit of measure which are predominately Level 2 fair value and based on observable inputs.\nMarket Risk Benefits\nMarket risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contractholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits include certain contract features on variable annuity products that provide minimum guarantees to policyholders. Guarantees accounted for as market risk benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”).\nVariable Annuities\nWe have approximately $86 billion of variable annuity account value that has been issued over a period of more than fifty years. The diversified variable annuity block consists of $43 billion of account value with no living benefit guarantees and $43 billion of account value with living benefit guarantees, primarily GMWB provisions. The business is predominately issued through the \nAmeriprise Financial\n®\n advisor network. The majority of the variable annuity contracts currently offered by us contain GMDB provisions. We also previously offered contracts containing GMWB, GMAB or GMIB provisions. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our variable annuity contracts.\n34\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nIn determining the assets or liabilities for market risk benefits, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, surrenders (also referred to as persistency), benefit utilization and investment margins. Management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. Unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.\nIn addition, the valuation of market risk benefits is impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. This estimate includes a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of the balance sheet date. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively. The change in fair value due to changes in our nonperformance risk is recorded in other comprehensive income.\nRegarding the exposure to variable annuity living benefit guarantees, changes to reserves due to behavioral risk are driven by changes in policyholder surrenders and utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. We have extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior. A significant volume of company-specific policyholder experience data is available and provides management with the ability to regularly analyze policyholder behavior. On a monthly basis, actual surrender and benefit utilization experience is compared to expectations. Experience data includes detailed policy information providing the opportunity to review impacts of multiple variables. The ability to analyze differences in experience, such as presence of a living benefit rider, existence of surrender charges, and tax qualifications provide us an effective approach in detecting changes in policyholder behavior.\nAt least annually, we perform a thorough policyholder behavior analysis to validate the assumptions included in our market risk benefit reserves. The variable annuity assumptions and resulting reserve computations reflect multiple policyholder variables. Differentiation in assumptions by policyholder age, existence of surrender charges, guaranteed withdrawal utilization, and tax qualification are examples of factors recognized in establishing management’s assumptions used in market risk benefit calculations. The extensive data derived from our variable annuity block informs management in confirming previous assumptions and revising the variable annuity behavior assumptions. Changes in assumptions are governed by a review and approval process to ensure an appropriate measurement of all impacted financial statement balances. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period.\nFuture Policy Benefits and Claims\nWe establish reserves to cover the benefits associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products. Non-traditional long-duration products include variable and structured variable annuity contracts, fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL policies. Traditional long-duration products include term life insurance, whole life insurance, disability income (“DI”) and LTC insurance and life contingent payout annuity products. UL and VUL policies with product features that result in profits followed by losses are accounted for as insurance liabilities. The portion of structured variable annuities, indexed annuities and indexed universal life (“IUL”) policies allocated to the indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative.\nThe establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. If actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required.\nNon-Traditional Long-Duration Products, including Embedded Derivatives\nUL and VUL\nA portion of our UL and VUL policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. These profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. The liability for these future losses is determined at the reporting date using actuarial models to estimate the death benefits in excess of account value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to client asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency and investment margins. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nThe fair value of embedded derivatives related to structured variable annuities, indexed annuities and IUL fluctuates based on equity markets and interest rates and is reported within our total liabilities. In addition, the valuation of embedded derivatives is impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. This estimate includes a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of the balance sheet date. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively.\nSee Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives. \n35\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nTraditional Long-Duration Products\nThe liabilities for traditional long-duration products include cash flows related to unpaid amounts on reported claims, estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life, whole life, DI, LTC, and life contingent payout annuity policies as claims are incurred in the future. Accordingly, the claim liability (also referred to as disabled life reserves) is presented together as one liability for future policy benefits.\nA liability for future policy benefits, which is the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders, is accrued as premium revenue is recognized. Expected insurance benefits are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to premium revenue recognized (referred to as the net premium approach). The net premium ratio reflects cash flows from contract inception to contract termination (i.e., through the claim paying period) and cannot exceed 100%.\nThe liability for future policy benefits is updated for actual experience at least on an annual basis and concurrent with changes to cash flow assumptions. When net premiums are updated for cash flow changes, the estimated cash flows over the entire life of a group of contracts are updated using historical experience and updated future cash flow assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period.\nThe cash flows used in the calculation are discounted using the forward rate curve on the original contract issue date. The discount rate represents an upper-medium-grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield (i.e., an A rating) that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. The fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available. We are unable to predict impacts and determine sensitivities in reported amounts reflecting such market movements on our aggregate derivative portfolio. Changes to assumptions do not occur in isolation and it is impracticable to predict such impacts at the individual security unit of measure which are predominately Level 2 fair value and based on observable inputs.\nFor further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see Note 2, Note 16 and Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSources of Revenues and Expenses\nManagement and Financial Advice Fees\nManagement and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, private funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services (including transfer agent and administration fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds) and other custodial services. Management and financial advice fees include performance-based incentive management fees, which we may receive on certain management contracts. Management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees.\nDistribution Fees\nDistribution fees primarily include point-of-sale fees (such as mutual fund front-end sales loads) and asset-based fees (such as 12b-1 distribution and shareholder service fees). Distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies’ products, such as through our wrap accounts, as well as surrender charges on annuities and UL and VUL insurance. Distribution fees also include revenue for placing clients’ deposits in its brokerage sweep program with third-party banks as well as revenue from brokerage clients for the execution of requested trades.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as Available-for-Sale, mortgage loans, policy loans, margin loans, pledged asset lines of credit, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and investments of CIEs; the changes in fair value of trading securities, certain derivatives and certain assets and liabilities of CIEs; the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments; realized gains and losses on the sale of investments; and changes for the allowance for credit losses. \nPremiums, Policy and Contract Charges\nPremiums include premiums on traditional life, DI and LTC insurance and payout annuities with a life contingent feature and are net of reinsurance premiums. Policy and contract charges include variable annuity rider charges and UL and VUL insurance charges, \n36\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nwhich consist of cost of insurance charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for UL and VUL insurance products) and administrative charges. \nOther Revenues\nOther revenues primarily include the accretion on the fixed annuities reinsurance deposit receivables and other miscellaneous revenues. \nBanking and Deposit Interest Expense\nBanking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to investment certificates and banking deposits.  \nDistribution Expenses\nDistribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors, registered representatives, third-party distributors and wholesalers. The portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract issued by the RiverSource Life companies are deferred. The amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs. The majority of these costs, such as advisor and wholesaler compensation, vary directly with the level of sales. Distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates. The majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales, or assets held, by these distributors, and the remainder is fixed. Distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs.\nInterest Credited to Fixed Accounts\nInterest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with UL and VUL insurance and annuity contracts. The changes in fair value of fixed deferred indexed annuity and IUL embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these products are also included within Interest credited to fixed accounts.\nBenefits, Claims, Losses and Settlement Expenses\nBenefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts, along with costs to process and pay such amounts. Amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses exclude the impact of remeasurement of future policy benefit reserves, which is separately presented. The changes in fair value of structured variable annuity embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging this benefit, as well as the amortization of DSIC are also included in Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.\nRemeasurement (Gains) Losses of Future Policy Benefit Reserves\nRemeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves represents changes to the net premium ratio for actual versus expected experience and updates to cash flow assumptions used to measure traditional long-duration and limited-payment insurance contracts.\nChange in Fair Value of Market Risk Benefits\nChange in fair value of market risk benefits includes the change in fair value of GMDB, GMIB, GMWB and GMAB as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging these market risk benefits. Changes in fair value of market risk benefits are recognized in net income each period with the exception of the portion of the change in fair value due to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”).\nAmortization of DAC\nDirect sales commissions and other costs capitalized as DAC are amortized over time. DAC are amortized on a constant-level basis for the grouped contracts over the expected contract term to approximate straight-line amortization.\nInterest and Debt Expense\nInterest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt and CIE debt, the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense includes compensation, share-based awards and other benefits for employees (other than employees directly related to distribution, such as financial advisors), professional and consultant fees, information technology, facilities and equipment, advertising and promotion, legal and regulatory and corporate related expenses.\n37\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nEconomic Environment\nGlobal equity market conditions and fluctuations affect our results of operations and financial condition.

AUM also include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs.\nAssets under administration include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets under administration also include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. \nAssets under advisement includes assets for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. \nThe following table presents detail regarding our Assets Under Management, Administration, and Advisement:\n \nDecember 31,\nChange\n2024\n2023\n(in billions)\nAssets Under Management, Administration, and Advisement\nAdvice & Wealth Management AUM\n$\n570.1 \n$\n484.8 \n$\n85.3 \n18 \n%\nAsset Management AUM\n644.9 \n636.9 \n8.0 \n1 \nCorporate AUM\n0.6 \n0.4 \n0.2 \n50 \nEliminations\n(44.8)\n(41.0)\n(3.8)\n(9)\nTotal Assets Under Management\n1,170.8 \n1,081.1 \n89.7 \n8 \nTotal Assets Under Administration\n317.2 \n279.5 \n37.7 \n13 \nTotal Assets Under Advisement (net of eliminations)\n34.0 \n25.4 \n8.6 \n34 \nTotal Assets Under Management, Administration, and Advisement\n$\n1,522.0 \n$\n1,386.0 \n$\n136.0 \n10 \n%\nTotal AUM increased $89.7 billion, or 8%, to $1.2 trillion as of December 31, 2024 compared to $1.1 trillion as of December 31, 2023 due to a $85.3 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by market appreciation and wrap account net inflows and an $8.0 billion increase in Asset Management AUM primarily driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.

In the prior year, the primary driver of the unlocking impact was lowered surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense.\nNet Revenues\nManagement and financial advice fees increased $1.2 billion, or 14%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting market appreciation and continued wrap account net inflows, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management and variable annuity net outflows. \nDistribution fees increased $129 million, or 7%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher transactional activity and market appreciation, partially offset by $162 million of lower fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash. \nNet investment income increased $442 million, or 14%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to the following impacts:\n•\nThe favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and SVA products.\n•\nThe favorable impact of higher investment portfolio yields.\nBanking and deposit interest expense increased $101 million, or 18%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates and higher average balances on certificates and Ameriprise Bank cash deposits.\nExpenses\nDistribution expenses increased $946 million, or 19%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher advisor compensation from higher average wrap account assets and increased transactional activity, as well as investments in recruiting experienced advisors, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. \nInterest credited to fixed accounts decreased $38 million, or 6%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items: \n•\nA $22 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $12 million for 2024 compared to an expense of $34 million for the prior year. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the current year, which reflected model changes and more discounting due to higher Treasury rates.\n•\nA $4 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $19 million for 2024 compared to an unfavorable impact of $15 million for the prior year. \n•\nA decrease in expense driven by variable annuity net outflows. \nBenefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $51 million, or 4%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting an $196 million decrease in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of hedging activity. This decrease was the result of a favorable $644 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable $448 million change in the market impact on the SVA embedded derivative. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher sales of life contingent payout annuities and increased volume in SVAs.\n40\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nChange in fair value of market risk benefits decreased $170 million, or 21%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:\n•\nA $227 million decrease in expense from market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges. This decrease was the result of a favorable $538 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves and an unfavorable $311 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:\n•\nEquity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit for 2024 compared to the prior year.\n•\nInterest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit for 2024 compared to the prior year.\n•\nVolatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for 2024 compared to the prior year.\n•\nOther unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a lower net expense for 2024 compared to the prior year.\n•\nAn increase in expense due to market appreciation on contractual fees.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $32 million, or 1%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher volume related expenses and investments for business growth, increased severance expense related to our expense management initiatives and higher performance fee related compensation, partially offset by ongoing benefits from our initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness, as well as prior year expenses including a $50 million accrual for a regulatory matter relating to electronic communication recordkeeping requirements and $62 million of integration related expenses associated with the acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 20.3% for 2024 compared to 21.0% for the prior year.

Average advisory wrap account assets increased $90.5 billion, or 21%, compared to the prior year reflecting net inflows and market appreciation. \nDistribution fees increased $180 million, or 8%, for 2024 compared to the prior year as non-brokerage cash revenue increased $342 million from strong transactional activity, including strong annuity sales and retail trading, along with market appreciation, while brokerage cash revenue decreased $162 million due to lower off-balance sheet brokerage cash balances and a lower average fee yield. \nNet investment income increased $239 million, or 12%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher average invested assets and the favorable impact of higher average investment yields on the investment portfolios supporting the bank and certificate products. The Federal Reserve reduced rates in September, November, and December of 2024, lowering the federal funds effective rate an average of 67 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago quarter. These rate cuts also impacted various short-term benchmark rates, upon which our floating rate securities and cash rates are indexed, which unfavorably impacted net investment income in the second half of 2024. \nBanking and deposit interest expense increased $101 million, or 18%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates and higher average balances on certificates and bank cash deposits.\n•\nThe average certificate reserve balance for ACC was $12.5 billion for 2024 compared to $11.8 billion for the prior year with the average crediting rate of 4.40% for 2024 compared to 3.96% for 2023.  \n•\nThe daily average interest-bearing deposit balance for the Ameriprise Bank increased to $21.5 billion for 2024 compared to $20.4 billion for the prior year with the average interest rate paid on deposits increasing to 0.44% for 2024 from 0.41% for 2023, which included both cash sweep and savings products.\nExpenses\nDistribution expenses increased $935 million, or 19%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher advisor compensation from higher average wrap account assets and increased transactional activity, as well as continued investments in recruiting experienced advisors. \nGeneral and administrative expense increased $34 million, or 2%, for 2024 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher volume related expenses and investments for business growth, partially offset by a $50 million accrual for a regulatory matter relating to electronic communication recordkeeping requirements in the prior year.\n44\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nAsset Management\nThe following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds as of December 31, 2024:\nRetail Fund Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles or Above Index Benchmark - Asset Weighted \n(1)\n1 year\n3 year\n5 year\n10 year\nEquity\n68%\n69%\n79%\n87%\nFixed Income\n69%\n69%\n80%\n93%\nAsset Allocation\n89%\n67%\n82%\n91%\n4- or 5-star Morningstar Rated Funds \n(2)\nOverall\n3 year\n5 year\n10 year\nNumber of rated funds\n108\n73\n79\n99\n(1) \nRetail Fund performance rankings for each fund are measured on a consistent basis against the most appropriate peer group or index.

Account values with living benefit riders declined to 50% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 54% a year ago reflecting our actions to optimize our business mix.

This block has been shrinking over the last few years given the average attained age is 84 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 89. Fifty-four percent of daily benefits in force in this block are lifetime benefits.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our comprehensive reimbursement LTC block had approximately $111 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.3 billion, net of reinsurance. This block has higher premiums per policy than the nursing home indemnity LTC policies. The average attained age is 80 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 86. Thirty-four percent of daily benefits in force in this block are lifetime benefits.\nWe utilize three primary levers to manage our LTC business. First, we have taken an active approach of steadily increasing rates since 2005, with cumulative rate increases of 268% on our nursing home indemnity LTC block (excluding home care riders) and 164% on our comprehensive reimbursement LTC block as of December 31, 2024. Second, we have a reserving process that reflects the policy features and risk characteristics of our blocks. As of December 31, 2024, we had 46,000 policies that were closed with claim activity, as well as 7,000 open claims. We apply this experience to our in force policies, which were 75,000 as of December 31, 2024, at a very granular level by issue year, attained age and benefit features. Our statutory reserves are $346 million higher than our GAAP reserves as they include margins on key assumptions for morbidity and mortality and include $330 million in asset adequacy reserves as of December 31, 2024. Lastly, we have prudently managed our investment portfolio primarily through a liquid, investment grade portfolio. \nWe undertake an extensive review of the cash flow and expense assumptions supporting the liability for future policy benefits annually during the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using current best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review. Our annual review process includes an analysis of our key reserve assumptions, including those for morbidity, terminations (mortality and lapses), and premium rate increases. \nFair Value Measurements\nWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, market risk benefits, embedded derivatives, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.\nFair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk\nCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of December 31, 2024. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the U.S. Treasury curve, the reduction to future total equity would be approximately $496 million, net of the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on December 31, 2024 credit spreads.\n50\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $8.1 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. had $856 million and $544 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage back securities. Additional sources of liquidity for Ameriprise Financial, Inc. include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $714 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in November 2029. Management’s estimate of liquidity available to the Ameriprise Financial, Inc. in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of December 31, 2024 was $2.1 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. \nUnder the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remained in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nIn addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, and advances at the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), and Ameriprise Bank are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of estimated borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities, of which $201 million was outstanding as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. In addition, Ameriprise Bank maintains access to borrowings from the Federal Reserve which are collateralized with residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we estimated $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve in addition to the FHLB capacity and there were no outstanding obligations.\nShort-term contractual obligations for the year 2025 include investment certificate maturities of $10.8 billion and estimated insurance and annuity benefits of $2.8 billion in addition to operating liquidity needs and maturing long-term debt in April 2025 of $500 million. We also hold banking and brokerage deposits of $24.6 billion that are payable on demand.  Long-term contractual obligations for years after 2025 include estimated insurance and annuity benefits of $57.7 billion.\nSee Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our long-term debt maturities.\nWe believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, our availability of internal and external borrowings, access to debt markets, and dividends from our subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and stress requirements.\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) issued its final rule establishing a consolidated capital framework termed the “Building Block Approach” (“BBA”) for savings and loan holding companies like Ameriprise Financial that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. For information on the impact of the BBA, see “Business - Regulation - Federal Banking and Financial Holding Company Regulation” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn August 16, 2022, federal legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) and the share repurchase excise tax. Both the CAMT and share repurchase tax were effective beginning in 2023. We are an applicable corporation required to compute CAMT; and, based on current estimates, we recorded a CAMT liability for 2024. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued proposed CAMT regulations in the third quarter of 2024. The proposed regulations are subject to public review and comment prior to finalizing. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed regulations. We are a covered corporation subject to the 1% excise tax on the net shares repurchased. We have recorded in shareholders’ equity an estimate of the excise tax liability based on our interpretation of the current guidance. As additional guidance is issued related to the IRA, we will continue to evaluate any impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published the Pillar Two model rules which introduce new taxing mechanisms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on profits from each jurisdiction in which they operate. Various jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation that became effective beginning January 1, 2024. We intend to rely on Pillar Two transitional safe harbors where available, and based on the current estimate, the tax impact is not material to the consolidated financial statements. We continue to monitor the adoption and implementation of these rules and evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n51\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nDividends from Subsidiaries\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc. is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, ACC, Ameriprise Bank, AMPF Holding, LLC, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (“AFS”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp. (“CMIS”), our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (“CMIA”), TAM UK International Holdings Ltd., which includes Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH within its organizational structure, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. For example, RiverSource Life payments in excess of statutory unassigned funds require advanced notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce (“MN DOC”), RiverSource Life’s primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. In addition, dividends and other distributions whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of the previous year’s statutory net gain from operations or 10% of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as “extraordinary dividends.” Extraordinary dividends also require advanced notice to MN DOC, and are subject to potential disapproval.\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15c3-1 provides an “alternative net capital requirement” which AEIS and AFS (significant broker dealers) have elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250 thousand or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements.\nAmeriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined), and under rules defined under the Basel III capital framework, Common equity Tier 1 capital (“CEIT”) to risk-weighted assets. Ameriprise Bank calculates these ratios under the Basel III standardized approach in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and Ameriprise Bank’s internal capital policies. As permitted under the rules of the Basel III capital framework, we have elected to exclude AOCI from the calculation of regulatory capital.\nACC is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). ACC markets and sells investment certificates to clients. ACC is subject to various capital requirements under the 1940 Act, laws of the State of Minnesota and understandings with the SEC and MN DOC.

In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator \n53\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nand rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs, as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non-LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC.\nDividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases\nWe paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $593 million and $569 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On January 29, 2025, we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per common share. The dividend will be paid on February 28, 2025 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on February 10, 2025.\nIn July 2023, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $3.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through September 30, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had $888 million remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing excess capital, future free cash flow generation and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased a total of 4.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $453.15 per share.\nCash Flows\nCash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash and cash equivalents are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash and cash equivalents segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.9 billion to $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $4.7 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting earnings from our fee based business operations, reduced net cash outflows in brokerage deposits, lower income taxes paid, and higher investment income. \nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio and in recent quarters is significantly affected by the net flows of our face amount certificates and bank deposit activity.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $8.7 billion to $551 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $9.3 billion for the prior year driven by a $6.5 billion increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, a $1.6 billion increase in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities and a $1.2 billion decrease in purchases of Available-for-Sale securities. \nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $5.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $4.4 billion for the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects a $6.4 billion decrease in net cash flows from investment certificates and a $2.4 billion decrease in the change in banking deposits, net. After a period of growth during a rising interest rate environment, our face amount certificates experienced net outflows during 2024.\nForward-Looking Statements \nThis report contains forward-looking statements that reflect management’s plans, estimates and beliefs.
