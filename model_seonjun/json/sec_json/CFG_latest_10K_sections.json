  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. We offer a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, small businesses, middle-market companies, large corporations and institutions. Our products and services are offered through more than 1,000 branches in 14 states and the District of Columbia and 97\n \nretail and commercial non-branch offices, though certain lines of business serve national markets. At December 31, 2024, we had total assets of $217.5 billion, total deposits of $174.8 billion and total stockholders’ equity of $24.3 billion. \nWe are a BHC incorporated under Delaware state law in 1984 and our primary federal regulator is the FRB. CBNA is our banking subsidiary, whose primary federal regulator is the OCC.\nBusiness Segments \nWe manage our business through two primary business segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Our activities outside these segments are classified as Non-Core or Other. Non-Core includes our indirect auto and certain purchased consumer loan portfolios that we discontinued the origination of in 2023 as part of our balance sheet optimization strategy. Other includes treasury activities, wholesale funding, the securities portfolio, community development assets, and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision (benefit) for credit losses and expenses, including income tax expense. For additional information regarding our business segments see the “Business Operating Segments” section of Item 7 and Note 26 in Item 8.\nConsumer Banking Segment \nConsumer Banking serves consumer customers and small businesses, with products and services that include deposits, mortgage and home equity lending, credit cards, small business loans, and wealth management and investment services largely across our 14-state traditional banking footprint. We also offer education and point-of-sale finance loans in addition to select digital deposit products nationwide. Citizens Private Bank integrates wealth management and banking services to serve high- and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families, as well as businesses.\nConsumer Banking operates a multi-channel distribution network with a workforce of approximately 5,000 branch colleagues, 1,000 branches, including 143 in-store locations, and 3,100 ATMs. Our network includes approximately 1,000 specialists covering lending, savings and investment needs as well as a broad range of small business products and services. We serve customers on a national basis through telephone service centers and our online and mobile platforms where we offer customers the convenience of depositing funds, paying bills and transferring money between accounts and from person to person, as well as a host of other everyday transactions.\nCommercial Banking Segment \nCommercial Banking primarily serves companies and institutions and strives to be a trusted advisor to our clients and preferred provider for their banking needs. We offer a broad complement of financial products and solutions, including lending and leasing, deposit and treasury management services, foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risk management solutions, as well as syndicated loans, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, and debt and equity capital markets capabilities.\nCommercial Banking is organized around client segments and their banking needs. Corporate Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Capital Markets and Advisory, and Treasury Solutions work together to understand client needs and provide comprehensive solutions to meet those needs. We acquire new clients through a coordinated approach to the market, leveraging deep industry knowledge in specialized banking groups and a geographic coverage model.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 6\nCorporate Banking serves commercial and industrial clients and corporate clients in the United States. In several areas, such as Aerospace, Defense and Government Services, Communications, Transportation and Logistics, Food and Restaurants, Human Capital Management, and Gaming we offer a more dedicated and tailored approach to better meet the unique needs of these client segments. \nCommercial Real Estate provides customized debt capital solutions for middle-market operators, institutional developers, investors, and REITs. Commercial Real Estate provides financing for projects primarily in the multi-family, office, industrial, retail, healthcare and hospitality sectors.\nCapital Markets and Advisory serves clients through key product groups including Corporate Finance, Capital Markets, and Global Markets. Corporate Finance provides advisory services to middle-market and mid-corporate clients, including mergers and acquisitions and capital structure advice. The team works closely with industry-sector specialists within capital markets to advise our clients. Corporate Finance also provides acquisition and follow-on financing for new and recapitalized portfolio companies of key sponsors, with services meeting the unique and time-sensitive needs of private equity firms, management companies and funds, and underwriting and portfolio management expertise for leveraged transactions and relationships. Capital Markets originates, structures and underwrites credit and equity facilities targeting middle-market, mid-corporate and private equity sponsors. They focus on offering value-added ideas to optimize their capital structures, including advising on and facilitating mergers and acquisitions, valuations, tender offers, financial restructurings, bond and equity underwriting, asset sales, divestitures and other corporate reorganizations and business combinations. Capital Markets also provides sales and trading across loan, fixed income and equity products, as well as other brokerage services including equity research. Global Markets provides foreign exchange, interest rate and commodities risk management services.\nThe Treasury Solutions product group supports Commercial Banking and certain small business clients with treasury management solutions, including domestic and international products and services related to receivables, payables, information reporting and liquidity management, as well as commercial credit cards and trade finance.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur mission is to help our customers, colleagues and communities reach their potential, and our vision is to become a top-performing bank distinguished by our customer-centric culture, mindset of continuous improvement, product innovation, and excellent capabilities. We strive to understand customer and client needs so we can tailor advice and solutions to help make them more successful. Our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business, drive sustainable growth and enhance profitability. Our success rests on our ability to distinguish ourselves as follows:\nMaintain a high-performing, customer-centric organization:\n We continually strive to enhance our “customer-first” culture by emphasizing the “voice of the customer” to deliver the best possible banking experience. We seek to deepen relationships with our customers by offering a full suite of products designed to meet their unique needs. In addition, we are taking talent management to the next level, with a goal of attracting, developing and retaining great people, while ensuring strong leadership, teamwork, and a sense of empowerment, accountability and urgency. \nDevelop differentiated value propositions to acquire, deepen, and retain core customer segments:\n Our focus is on select customer segments where we believe we are well positioned to compete. In Consumer Banking, we focus on serving mass affluent and affluent customers, small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. Our Private Bank serves high- and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, family offices, private equity/venture capital firms, and business clients through integrated wealth management and banking services. In Commercial Banking, we focus on serving customers in the middle-market, mid-corporate, and select industry verticals. By developing differentiated and targeted value propositions, building our fee-based businesses and developing innovative product solutions, we believe we can attract new customers, deepen relationships with existing customers and deliver an enhanced customer experience. \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 7\nBuild excellent capabilities designed to help us stand out from competitors:\n We strive to deliver seamless, omni-channel experiences that allow customers to interact with us when, where and how they choose. We are enhancing capabilities in key areas including technology, payments, data and analytics, private bank and wealth, collections and fraud, and digital (mobile/online banking and omni-channel servicing). We are on a multi-year digital transformation journey across our Consumer and Commercial organizations to digitize end-to-end customer experiences and transform our marketing to drive consumer-direct acquisition in order to satisfy rapidly changing customer preferences. We strive to use advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence for personalization and to provide timely, insight-driven, tailored advice in order to deliver solutions to consumer and commercial customers throughout their lifecycles.\nOperate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to self-fund investments: \nWe believe that continued focus on operational efficiency is critical to our future profitability and ability to continue to reinvest to drive future growth. We launched the first Tapping our Potential (“TOP”) initiative in 2014 and have launched additional programs in subsequent years. These programs are designed to transform how we operate and to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and competitiveness of our franchise. Our TOP 9 program was completed in 2024, and we launched a TOP 10 program in 2025 to allow us to continue to self-fund investments. \nPrudently grow and optimize our balance sheet:\n We operate with a strong balance sheet with regard to capital and liquidity, coupled with a well-defined and prudent risk appetite. We continue to focus on thoughtfully growing our balance sheet by actively managing capital and resource allocations towards relationships-oriented growth to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our goal is to be good stewards of our resources and continue to rigorously evaluate our execution.\nModernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery, organizational agility and speed to market:\n We are continuing to modernize our technology environment by strengthening our infrastructure and migrating applications to the cloud. We have deployed and scaled an agile operating model to improve our speed-to-market, deliver innovative products and services and strengthen collaboration across teams. We also continue to actively incubate new innovative ideas and harness external innovation through FinTech partnerships and access to venture capital firms to help deliver differentiated value-added experiences for our customers. We continue to experiment with and deploy transformative technologies like Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI/Gen AI) across our customer-facing businesses and functions to drive value-add impact and improved experiences for our colleagues and customers.\nEmbed risk management within our culture and operations:\n Given that the quality of our risk management program directly affects our ability to execute our strategy, we continue to work to further strengthen our risk management culture. Moreover, we are committed to continuously enhancing our processes and talent, and to making improvements in the platform including ongoing investments in risk technology and frameworks. These actions are designed to support and enhance our risk management capabilities and regulatory profile.\nCompetition \nThe financial services industry is highly competitive. Our branch footprint is predominantly in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, though certain lines of business serve national markets. Within these markets, we face competition from community banks, super-regional and national financial institutions, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products, pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes. In addition, some of our competitors may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as we are and, therefore, may have lower costs they can pass on to customers. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers and businesses having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, such as Private Credit/Direct lenders. The ability of non-banking financial institutions, including FinTech companies, to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 8\nIn Consumer Banking, the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted through online and mobile channels. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-bank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services. The emergence of digital-only banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Given their lower cost structure, these models are typically able to offer higher rates on deposit products than traditional retail banking institutions. The primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates, fees charged, tailored value propositions to different customer segments, customer service levels, convenience, including branch locations and hours of operation, and the range of products and services offered. \nIn Commercial Banking, we face competition in all our client segments from a variety of industry participants including traditional banking institutions, particularly large regional banks, as well as commercial finance companies, leasing companies, other non-bank lenders, and institutional investors, including collateralized loan obligation managers, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some larger competitors, including certain national banks that compete in our market area, may offer a broader array of products and be in a position to hold more exposure on their balance sheet due to their asset size. We compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions, quality of customer service and execution, range of products offered, price and reputation.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our long-term success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a high-performing workforce. Our goal is to create an environment where colleagues can thrive personally and professionally and can maximize their potential. As of December 31, 2024, Citizens had 17,287 full-time equivalent employees, primarily across New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Our Board of Directors and its Compensation and Human Resources Committee are responsible for overseeing our human capital management strategy, with senior management providing regular updates to facilitate that oversight.\nLeadership, Talent Development, and Talent Acquisition and Internal Mobility\nWe are on a multi-year journey to build bold leaders at every level and to foster a culture of learning and innovation. We facilitate programs aimed at developing leadership capabilities and building capabilities to ensure colleagues excel in their current roles and are valuable contributors in the future. Citizens Talent Matters, launched in 2024, is a talent marketplace that creates personalized experiences to support skill-building and career advancement for colleagues. We have also expanded educational assistance and educational pathways for emerging and critical skills through our academies, which focus on areas such as Innovation, Agile, Next Gen Tech, Banking and Credit, and Data & Analytics. Continuous learning and a growth mindset are essential for colleagues to thrive as part of our organization and to feel a sense of accomplishment and purpose.\nAttracting and retaining talent with the skills and experience necessary to drive our long-term priorities remains integral to achieving our strategic plan. We evaluate candidates on their holistic portfolio of skills and experiences. Ongoing competition for talent in high-volume roles and emerging skill areas persists, and we have implemented new processes to improve the efficiency of the hiring process. Talent selection will continue to have broad impacts on culture, leadership, and productivity at all levels and focus remains on expanding capabilities to attract, select, and retain talent.\nEmployee Engagement\nListening to our colleagues’ voices and experiences is important to us and is instrumental in helping management evolve company culture to best support our business strategy. Colleague feedback is used to refine our focus, address gaps, and strengthen efforts to improve our organizational effectiveness and colleague experience. We have enhanced our colleague listening efforts to include multiple channels and more frequent touch points, including our annual organizational health survey as well as an interim pulse survey and five life-cycle surveys measuring colleague sentiment at different stages.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 9\nCulture of Inclusion\nWe aim to foster a culture where all stakeholders feel respected, valued, and heard. Development programs are designed to build a strong pipeline of emerging talent and have been effective in increasing the development of our colleague base. We also partner with external organizations to offer additional resources for reskilling and upskilling colleagues as we build the workforce of the future. An area of focus is the development of partnerships with businesses and community organizations to help identify candidates with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Information regarding our workforce demographics can be found in our Environmental Social Governance Report and on our website, which includes a link to our most recently filed EEO-1 report.\nVarious resources are used by management to understand what drives a sense of inclusion and belonging. Analytics are used to help prioritize initiatives, including responses to our Organizational Health Survey, which we segment by various colleague populations to provide additional insights. In addition, we have seven business resource groups (“BRGs”), which we believe are important to enhancing our culture while supporting our enterprise inclusion strategy. They also help to identify and support initiatives that are most important to customers, colleagues, and the community. Our BRGs, which are open to all employees, include Citizens WIN (Women’s Impact Network), Citizens Elev8 (Rising Professionals), Prism (Multicultural), Citizens Pride (LGBTQ+), Citizens Veterans, Citizens Awake (Disability Awareness), and Caring for Citizens (Caregivers). Each BRG is sponsored by a member of the executive team and approximately 3,700 colleagues belonged to at least one BRG as of December 31, 2024.\nHealth, Well-Being, and Flexibility\nWe prioritize the health and well-being of our colleagues and their loved ones, offering benefit programs and other resources that support colleagues in all aspects of their lives. We review our offerings on a regular basis and have expanded resources in recent years, with a particular focus on colleague well-being. In 2024, we launched a colleague podcast that explores well-being from the perspectives of different company leaders and colleagues, and began curating monthly content on our intranet aimed at encouraging colleagues to make their well-being a priority. In addition, we introduced Citizens CARES, a colleague emergency assistance program designed to provide financial assistance to team members navigating personal hardships. In recognition of the continued impact of inflation on colleagues, we have absorbed most of the increase to medical plan premiums and kept colleague deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums flat for all medical plans/tiers for 2025.\nWe embrace flexibility and manage our hybrid workforce in a manner that ensures colleagues are working in ways that best support our customers, foster engagement and innovation, and maintain our company culture.\nFair and Equitable Compensation\nWe strive to compensate our colleagues fairly based on market data, experience, and performance, and we compare our compensation to other companies in our peer group as well as others in the financial services industry.\nPart of our commitment to building and fostering a diverse, inclusive, high-performing culture includes ensuring our compensation and benefits are fair and competitive for all colleagues. We engage an independent third-party expert firm to conduct an annual pay equity analysis, accounting for factors that appropriately explain differences in pay such as role, performance, and experience. Additional information about this analysis, including our most recent results, can be found in our Environmental Social Governance Report and on our website.\nSustainability\nOur integrated, enterprise-wide Sustainability & Impact strategy helps us build a better future for all those we serve and, led by robust corporate governance, helps guide the decisions we make. Our strategy means serving our customers and clients, engaging shareholders, monitoring our environmental impact and empowering our colleagues and communities to thrive. Our four focus areas include robust corporate governance, positive climate impact, the workforce of the future, and fostering strong communities, which speak to what we believe are the strengths of our company and how we are driving growth and having a positive impact on our business, society, and the planet. \nIn 2023, we announced a $50 billion Sustainable Finance Target, including $5 billion in green financing, by 2030. As part of this announcement, we committed to engage corporate clients in high-emitting sectors on climate-related topics and to achieving operational carbon neutrality by 2035.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 10\nFor more details regarding our sustainability efforts, go to our website.\nRegulation and Supervision\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination under federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, deposit insurance, customer privacy and cybersecurity, capital adequacy and planning, liquidity, safety and soundness, consumer protection and disclosure, permissible activities and investments, and certain transactions with affiliates. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of customers, depositors, the DIF and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors. The discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries, but do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in laws or regulations. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to examinations by federal banking regulators, as well as the SEC, FINRA, CFTC and various state insurance and securities regulators. In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed, and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries. As part of our regular examination process, regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. We have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level, including from banking, securities and insurance regulators, state attorneys general, federal agencies or law enforcement authorities, and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. For a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.” For additional information regarding regulatory matters, see Note 25 in Item 8.\nOverview\nWe are a BHC under the Bank Holding Company Act and have elected to be treated as a FHC under amendments to this Act as effected by GLBA. As such, we are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the FRB, including through the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Under the system of “functional regulation” established under the Bank Holding Company Act, the FRB serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization. The OCC serves as the primary regulator for CBNA, and the SEC and FINRA serve as the primary regulators of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.\nThe federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. These banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Federal law governs the activities in which CBNA engages, including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of available credit that it may grant to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations. The actions the FRB takes to implement monetary policy also affect us.\nIn addition, CBNA is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions, such as CBNA, with more than $10 billion in total assets. The CFPB may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In 2024, CBNA registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the National Futures Association, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry, to accommodate growth in its hedging business. For more information see “Regulation of Derivatives” below.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory Tailoring Rules\nAs a BHC with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets, we are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards and associated capital and liquidity rules (“Tailoring Rules”). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC, including its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and certain risk-based indicators. CFG and CBNA are each subject to Category IV standards, the least restrictive of the requirements under the Tailoring Rules.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 11\nBank and Financial Holding Company Regulation\nAs a FHC, we may engage in a broader range of activities than a BHC that is not also a FHC. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the FRB, in coordination with the Treasury Department, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the FRB determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. In addition, a FHC may commence new permissible financial activities or acquire non-bank financial companies engaged in such activities, in either case, with after-the-fact notice to the FRB.\nTo maintain FHC status, a BHC and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed,” as described below under “Federal Deposit Insurance Act.” If a BHC fails to meet these regulatory standards, the FRB could place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for FHCs or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the BHC or its affiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the FRB could order the BHC to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for FHCs that are not permissible for BHCs, or the BHC could elect to conform its non-banking activities to those permissible for a BHC that is not also a FHC. In addition, the CRA requires U.S. banks to help serve the needs of their communities. If a depository institution subsidiary of a BHC were to receive a CRA rating of less than “satisfactory”, the BHC would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities or acquisitions (see “Community Reinvestment Act” below).\nFederal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or BHCs. As noted above, FRB approval is generally not required for BHCs to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior regulatory approval is required, however, before a BHC may acquire or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, including a FHC, or a bank. In considering applications for approval of acquisitions, the banking regulators may take several factors into account, including the competitive effects of the transaction in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of companies involved in the transaction; the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the U.S. banking or financial system; the companies’ compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the performance record of the IDIs involved in the transaction under the CRA.\nCapital and Stress Testing Requirements\nWe are required to comply with the U.S. Basel III rules, which establish risk-based and leverage capital requirements. The risk-based requirements are based on a banking organization’s RWA, which is inclusive of the organization’s on- and off-balance sheet exposures. We calculate RWA using the standardized approach and have made the AOCI opt-out election, permitting us to exclude components of AOCI from regulatory capital. The leverage requirements are based on a banking organization’s average consolidated on-balance sheet assets.\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, the minimum capital ratios are:\n•\nCET1 capital ratio of 4.5%;\n•\nTier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%;\n•\nTotal capital ratio of 8.0%; and\n•\nTier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.\nFor BHCs with $100 billion or more in assets, such as us, the FRB’s capital rules impose an institution-specific SCB on top of each of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above. Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios including the SCB will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income”, defined as the greater of four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income, or the average four quarter trailing net income.\nIn response to the COVID disruption, the federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of the ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. The three-year transition period phased-in the reversal of the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 12\nAs a Category IV firm under the Tailoring Rules, we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. The FRB supervises Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluating the capital adequacy and capital planning processes of firms during off-cycle years. We are required to develop, maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our Board of Directors, or one of its committees, as well as FR Y-14 reporting requirements.\nIn July 2023, the federal banking regulators issued a proposal to implement the final components of the Basel III capital framework. The proposal, commonly referred to as Basel III “Endgame,” would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more, including the Company and CBNA as Category IV firms. Under the proposal, the Company and CBNA would become subject to the same capital treatment regarding the inclusion of AOCI, deductions, and rules for minority interest as Category I and II firms. The proposal would also replace the existing models-based approaches for credit and operational risk, which currently apply to only Category I and II firms, with two new approaches applicable to Category I through IV firms. The first approach would use the existing standardized approach and a proposed revised market risk capital rule, and the second approach would use a new expanded risk-based approach, consisting of new non-models-based approaches for credit, operational, and credit valuation adjustment risk, as well as the proposed revised market risk capital rule. The approach resulting in the lower ratio would establish the binding ratio for purposes of satisfying regulatory capital requirements and buffers, including the SCB. The Company and CBNA would also be required to calculate counterparty credit exposure relating to derivative transactions using the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk and would become subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and CBNA expect to remain above the current minimum capital and buffer requirements if the proposal were adopted in its current form. The FRB has indicated that it expects to work with the other federal banking regulators in 2025 on a revised proposal.\nWe are also subject to the FRB's risk-based capital requirements for market risk. See the “Market Risk” section of Item 7 for additional details.\nFor more details regarding our regulatory capital and SCB, and the AOCI impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal on our regulatory capital, see the “Capital and Regulatory Matters” section of Item 7.\nLiquidity Requirements\nThe liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) is designed to ensure that a covered bank or BHC maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. Under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as us, are not subject to any LCR or NSFR requirement.\nWe are subject to certain liquidity requirements under the Tailoring Rules including liquidity buffer, stress testing, risk management and reporting requirements. In addition, as a Category IV firm, we are required to calculate collateral positions monthly, establish a set of liquidity risk limits, and monitor certain elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures.\nResolution Planning\nCategory IV firms such as CFG are no longer required to submit resolution plans under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. However, CBNA is required to periodically file an IDI resolution plan with the FDIC. This plan enables the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the FDIA in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the institution’s assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to the institution’s creditors. CBNA submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC on December 1, 2022 in accordance with the FDIC’s Statement on Resolution Plans for IDIs issued in 2021.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 13\nOn June 20, 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule that requires IDIs with $100 billion or more in average total assets that are not affiliates of U.S. global systemically important banking organizations, including CBNA, to submit full resolution plans triennially that include a comprehensive strategy from the point of failure to liquidation or return of the institution to the private sector. The identified strategy must ensure timely access to insured deposits, maximize value from the sale or disposition of assets, minimize losses realized by creditors, and address potential risks of adverse effects on U.S. economic conditions or financial stability. In addition, the resolution strategy must utilize the formation and stabilization of a bridge depository institution that continues operation through the completion of the resolution and exit from the bridge depository institution, unless the IDI determines and demonstrates why another strategy would be more appropriate, could be executed across a range of likely failure scenarios, and best addresses the credibility criteria. The final rule also includes criteria for the FDIC to assess the credibility of resolution plans and expands expectations regarding capabilities testing. CBNA’s initial resolution plan submission under the final rule is due on or before July 1, 2025.\nLong-Term Debt Requirements\nIn August 2023, the federal banking regulators issued a proposal that would require large bank holding companies and IDIs with total assets of $100 billion or more, such as CFG and CBNA, to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt. The joint agency proposal aims to increase the resolvability and resiliency of large banking organizations by mandating a long-term debt requirement to provide the regulatory agencies additional resources to resolve failed banking organizations, foster depositor confidence, and decrease costs to the DIF in the event of a large banking organization failure. Under the proposal, large bank holding companies and IDIs would each be required to maintain a minimum amount of eligible long-term debt equal to the greater of 6 percent of RWA, 3.5 percent of average total consolidated assets, and 2.5 percent of total leverage exposure for those banks subject to the supplementary leverage ratio. The proposal also prohibits large banking organizations from engaging in certain activities that could complicate their resolution and discourages them from holding long-term debt issued by other banks to reduce interconnectedness. The proposal provides for a three-year transition period, with 25 percent of the long-term debt requirement to be met one year after the rule is finalized, 50 percent after two years, and 100 percent after three years.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness\nThe FDIA requires the federal banking regulators to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all IDIs, including CBNA. Regulations and interagency guidelines adopted by these agencies set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at IDIs before capital becomes impaired. If an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard, it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. If, after being notified to submit a compliance plan, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other types of actions that an undercapitalized institution is subject to under the FDIA as discussed in “Federal Deposit Insurance Act” below. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act\nThe FDIA requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to IDIs that do not meet minimum capital requirements, as described above in “Capital and Stress Testing Requirements.” The FDIA sets forth the following five capital categories: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” An IDI’s capital category is determined based on how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. The federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category. Under existing rules, an IDI that is not an advanced approaches institution, such as CBNA, is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 14\nThe FRB’s regulations which are applicable to BHCs, such as the Parent Company, separately define “well capitalized” as having a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6% and a total capital ratio of at least 10%. As described above under “Bank and Financial Holding Company Regulation”, a FHC that is not well capitalized and well managed (or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed) under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose FHC status. As of December 31, 2024, both the Parent Company and CBNA were well-capitalized. \nThe FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally, depending upon where the deposits are solicited, unless it is “well-capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. The FDIA imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “well-capitalized.”\nDeposit Insurance\nThe DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor based on ownership right and capacity category codes and is funded through assessments on IDIs based on the risk each institution poses to the DIF. CBNA accepts customer deposits insured by the DIF and, therefore, must pay insurance premiums. The FDIC may increase CBNA’s insurance premiums based on various factors, including the FDIC’s assessment of its risk profile. The FDIC also requires large depository institutions, including CBNA, to maintain enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system capabilities to facilitate prompt calculation of insured deposits if such an institution was taken into FDIC receivership.\nThe FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio, 1.25% as of September 30, 2024, to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. This plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. During 2022, the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028, absent an increase in assessment rates. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. This increase in assessment rates was intended to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio will reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028.\nIn November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to impose special assessments to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, as required by the FDIA. Under the final rule, the special assessment was levied on an IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits as reported on its December 31, 2022 Call Report, excluding the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessment was imposed at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points to be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of 2024.\nThe FDIC’s current estimate of the loss attributable to this systemic risk determination is $18.9 billion. This estimate will be periodically adjusted as assets are sold, liabilities are satisfied, and receivership expenses are incurred. The FDIC would cease collection of special assessments before the end of the initial eight-quarter collection period if they expect the loss to be less than expected assessment collections. The FDIC also reserves the right to impose an extended special assessment collection period after the initial eight-quarter period to collect the difference between losses and amounts collected, and impose a one-time final shortfall special assessment after both receiverships terminate. As of September 30, 2024, the FDIC projects that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, at an estimated quarterly rate of 1.69 basis points.\nBased on the final rule and related accounting guidance, CBNA’s special assessment is approximately $256 million, with $31 million and $225 million, respectively, recognized in other operating expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. CBNA’s special assessment is subject to change if the eventual loss to the DIF differs from the FDIC’s current estimate.\nDividends\nVarious federal statutory provisions and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 15\nOur payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to oversight by the FRB. In particular, the FRB reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large BHC based on capital plans submitted as part of the CCAR process and the results of stress tests, as discussed under “Capital and Stress Testing Requirements” above. In addition to other limitations, our ability to make any capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, is subject to the prior approval of the FRB if we are required to resubmit our capital plan.\nDividends payable by CBNA, as a national bank subsidiary, are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared during any calendar year exceeds the sum of current year net income and retained net income of the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” (generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). Federal banking regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. \nSupport of Subsidiary Bank\nThe Parent Company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to CBNA and, under appropriate conditions, to commit resources to support CBNA. This support may be required by the FRB at times when the Parent Company may not have the financial resources to do so, or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors. In addition, any capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a BHC’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation W establish certain quantitative limits and other prudential requirements for loans, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions between a member bank, including CBNA, or its subsidiaries and its affiliates.\nSection 23A prohibits a bank from entering a “covered transaction” with an affiliate if, after the transaction, the aggregate amount of the bank’s covered transactions with that affiliate would exceed 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, or the aggregate amount of the bank’s covered transactions with all of its affiliates would exceed 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. Covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit to an affiliate, investments in the securities of an affiliate, purchases of assets from an affiliate, and certain other transactions that expose the bank to the credit risks of its affiliates.\nSection 23B requires that transactions, including all covered transactions, be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliates (the “Market Terms Requirement”). In addition to covered transactions, the Market Terms Requirement applies to certain other transactions between CBNA and its affiliates, including services between CBNA and the Parent Company and loans to CBNA from the Parent Company.\nUnder sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation O, we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit may not exceed certain quantitative limits, must be made on substantially the same terms as those currently prevailing in the market for comparable transactions with third parties, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board.\nVolcker Rule\nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as certain hedge funds or private equity funds. This statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” Under this rule, we are viewed as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities, which subjects us to a simplified compliance program requirement that is appropriate for our activities, size, scope, and complexity. This rule does not have a material impact on Citizens.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 16\nRegulation of Derivatives\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a regulatory framework with respect to OTC derivatives, including swaps and security-based swaps. This framework requires registration of certain market participants as swap dealers and security-based swap dealers, and central clearing and trade execution of certain swaps and security-based swaps on regulated exchanges or execution facilities.\nCBNA has registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and is subject to the CFTC’s regulatory regime, including business conduct standards, recordkeeping, and transaction and financial reporting requirements. CBNA also is subject to regulation by the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization.\nIn addition, CBNA is subject to the OCC’s rules that mandate the exchange of initial margin and variation margin for swaps and security-based swaps between CBNA and specified counterparties that are not centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house. The amount of margin required varies based on the relative risk of the associated swap.\nConsumer Financial Protection Regulations\nThe retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts.\nIn addition to these federal laws and regulations, the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influence loan and deposit operations.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws, including those referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, such as CBNA, including the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules applicable to banks with $10 billion or more in assets, such as CBNA, that establish standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibit network exclusivity and routing restrictions. These rules establish a maximum permissible interchange fee that banks may charge for many types of debit card transactions. In October 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed amendments to these rules that would reduce this maximum permissible interchange fee and establish automatic updates to the fee every other year based on a survey of debit card issuers. We will continue to monitor the proposed changes to these rules.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards than those adopted at the federal level, and in certain circumstances allows state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations on banks like us.\nProtection of Customer Personal Information and Cybersecurity\nThe privacy provisions of GLBA generally prohibit financial institutions, including us, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, which are issued by the FRB, govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies.\nIn October 2024, the CFPB adopted a rule regarding personal financial data rights that applies to financial institutions that offer consumer deposit accounts, such as CBNA. Covered financial institutions are required to provide consumers electronic access to 24 months of transaction data and certain account information and are prohibited from imposing any fees or charges for maintaining or providing access to such data. The rule also imposes data accuracy, retention and other obligations. For banks with total assets between $10 billion and $250 billion, compliance with the rule is required by April 1, 2027.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 17\nThe federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers when accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. Further, a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware or other compromise of customer data and/or systems. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack or compromise. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. For further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”\nA financial institution is also required to notify its primary banking regulator within 36 hours of computer-security incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade its:\n•\nability to carry out banking operations, activities, or processes, or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base;\n•\nbusiness lines, including associated operations, services, functions, and support, that upon failure would result in a material loss of revenue, profit, or franchise value; or\n•\noperations, including associated services, functions, and support, the failure or discontinuance of which would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.\nIn addition, the SEC requires registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K, which must describe the material aspects of the nature, scope and timing of the incident, as well as the impact of the incident on the registrant. In Form 10-K filings, registrants are required to describe their processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats and whether such risks have materially affected the registrant. Registrants must also describe Board oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from such threats. See Item 1C “Cybersecurity” for more information.\nState regulators have also been active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and provide details with respect to these programs. In addition, many states have implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate.\nClimate-Related Laws and Regulations\nOn March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted a final rule to require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying its final rule pending completion of the judicial review of certain petitions challenging the rule. Several states in which we operate have also enacted or proposed statutes or regulations addressing climate-related issues. For example, California has enacted laws that impose climate-related disclosure requirements on certain companies doing business in California, while some states have enacted, or proposed to enact, divergent or sometimes conflicting statutes, including those that prohibit financial institutions from denying or canceling products or services on the basis of social credit scores and certain other factors. We will continue to monitor developments on these laws and regulations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 18\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe CRA requires CBNA’s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the OCC, to evaluate the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and individuals. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” A bank’s CRA record is considered by regulatory agencies in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. In addition, the CRA record of a subsidiary bank of a FHC is considered if a FHC wishes to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities, which requires a rating of at least “satisfactory.” CBNA received an “Outstanding” rating on its most recent CRA evaluation. \nIn October 2023, the federal banking regulators issued a joint final rule that revises the agencies’ CRA regulations. The primary provisions of the final rule, along with the most significant changes from the existing CRA regulatory framework, are outlined below:\n•\na tiered evaluation framework is established based on a bank’s asset size, similar to the existing CRA regulatory framework;\n•\nthe geographic area in which banks may be evaluated for performance is expanded to include areas outside of where they have physical locations in order to capture the varied activities a bank conducts, such as online and mobile banking, and the communities in which it operates;\n•\nbank retail lending and community development financing will be evaluated using a new metrics-based approach; and\n•\nclarifies eligible CRA activities, such as affordable housing.\nThe final rule took effect on April 1, 2024, with most of its requirements effective January 1, 2026, and certain reporting requirements effective January 1, 2027. A court has issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the federal banking regulators from enforcing the revised regulations pending resolution of the lawsuit challenging the regulations. We will continue to monitor the outcome of this preliminary injunction.\nCompensation\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal banking regulators. Guidance issued jointly by the federal banking regulators is designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: \n•\nthe arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; \n•\nthe arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and\n•\nthe arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. \nThe U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the SEC, jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulations implementing the requirements of Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act have not been finalized and future implementation remains uncertain.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 19\nAnti-Money Laundering\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering (“AML”) and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The BSA, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to maintain an AML program, verify the identity of customers and certain beneficial owners for legal entity customers, monitor for and report suspicious transactions, report on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. We are also required to provide our employees with AML training, designate an AML compliance officer, and undergo an annual, independent audit to assess the effectiveness of our AML program. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these AML requirements. Financial services regulators are focusing their examinations on AML compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our AML compliance programs. The federal banking agencies are required, when reviewing bank and bank holding company acquisition or merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the AML activities of the applicants.\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”), enacted in 2021 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, requires the U.S. Treasury Department to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may, over the next few years, significantly alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the BSA and the Patriot Act impose on financial institutions. The AMLA also increases penalties for violations of the BSA and significantly expands a whistleblower award program both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement. In 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, issued the priorities for AML and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. These priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation\nThe U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others, that are administered by OFAC. OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms and generally contain one or more of the following elements: \n•\nrestrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and \n•\na blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons. Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. \nLists including the names of individuals and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, is published and routinely updated by OFAC. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after they occur. If we identify a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list we must freeze the associated account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.\nRegulation of Broker-Dealers\nOur subsidiaries, Citizens Securities, Inc., and Citizens JMP Securities, LLC are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and subject to regulation and examination by the SEC as well as FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations. These regulations cover a broad range of matters, including capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. In addition to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration of certain broker-dealers.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 20\nHeightened Risk Governance Standards\nCBNA is subject to OCC guidelines that impose heightened risk governance standards on large national banks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and its associated oversight by a bank’s board of directors. The guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve the ability of bank examiners to assess compliance with the OCC’s expectations. Under the guidelines, a bank may use the risk governance framework of its parent company if it meets the minimum standards and the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same, along with certain other conditions. CBNA has elected to use the Parent Company’s risk governance framework. A bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of bank and parent company management, ensure that the risk governance framework meets the appropriate standards, provide active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions, and ensure that decisions made by the parent company do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank.\n \nIntellectual Property\nIn the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks and logos are important to the success of our business. We own and license a variety of trademarks, service marks, and logos and are developing resources to enhance our stand-alone brands.\nWebsite Access to Citizens’ Filings with the SEC and Corporate Governance Information\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are available on our website, free of charge, at investor.citizensbank.com, along with amendments to such reports that are filed or furnished to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934. These documents are made available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

Headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, we offer a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, small businesses, middle-market companies, large corporations and institutions. We help our customers reach their potential by listening to them and by understanding their needs in order to offer tailored advice, ideas and solutions. In Consumer Banking, we provide an integrated experience that includes mobile and online banking, a full-service customer contact center and the convenience of approximately 3,100 ATMs and more than 1,000 branches in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Consumer Banking products and services include a full range of banking, lending, savings, wealth management and small business offerings. In Commercial Banking, we offer a broad complement of financial products and solutions, including lending and leasing, deposit and treasury management services, foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risk management solutions, as well as loan syndication, corporate finance, merger and acquisition, and debt and equity capital markets capabilities.\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, as well as other information contained in this document.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as “Underlying” results and “including AOCI impact.” Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results.\nOther companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.\nNon-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&A by the use of the term “Underlying.” Where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.”\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 39\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nKey Highlights\nNet income decreased $99 million, with earnings per diluted common share down $0.10 to $3.03 compared to 2023.\nResults reflect notable items of $98 million or $0.21 per diluted common share, net of tax benefit, compared to $357 million or $0.75 per diluted common share, net of tax benefit, in 2023.\nTable 1: Notable Items \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nLess: notable items\n(dollars in millions)\nReported results (GAAP)\nIntegration related costs\n(1)\nTOP and other\n(2)\nFDIC special assessment\n(3)\nUnderlying results (non-GAAP)\nNoninterest income\n$2,176 \n$— \n$15 \n$— \n$2,161 \nNoninterest expense\n5,234 \n10 \n115 \n31 \n5,078 \nIncome tax expense\n379 \n(3)\n(33)\n(7)\n422 \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nLess: notable items\n(dollars in millions)\nReported results (GAAP)\nIntegration related costs\n(1)\nTOP and other\n(2)\nFDIC special assessment\n(3)\nUnderlying results (non-GAAP)\nNoninterest income\n$1,983 \n$— \n$— \n$— \n$1,983 \nNoninterest expense\n5,507 \n104 \n177 \n225 \n5,001 \nIncome tax expense\n422 \n(28)\n(63)\n(58)\n571 \n(1)\n Includes integration related costs associated with acquisitions.\n(2)  \nPrimarily includes our TOP revenue and efficiency initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(3)  \nRepresents an industry-wide FDIC special assessment.

The level of our net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Factors that influence our net interest income include, but are not limited to, the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. For further discussion, refer to the “Market Risk” and “Risk Governance” sections of this report.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 41\nThe following table presents the major components of our net interest income. Average balance represents amortized cost, excluding the unamortized basis adjustments related to the transfer of certain HTM securities from AFS, and LHFS. The yield/rate is based on annualized interest income or expense for the periods presented and includes the impact of hedging activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories.\nTable 2: Major Components of Net Interest Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(dollars in

margin on a FTE basis decreased 25 basis points compared to 2023, reflecting higher funding and swap costs and the impact of building liquidity, partially offset by higher interest-earning-asset yields and the benefit of Non-Core portfolio runoff.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 42\nAverage interest-earning assets decreased $3.6 billion compared to 2023, driven by a decline in total loans

loan syndication fees.\n•\nCard fees increased driven primarily by higher credit card fees, including favorable vendor contract negotiations.\n•\nWealth fees reflect increased sales activity and higher asset management fees.\n•\nForeign exchange and derivative products revenue decreased given reduced client activity related to interest rate and commodities hedging.\n•\nMortgage banking fees

expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2023, was driven primarily by other operating expense associated with FDIC deposit insurance, reflecting an estimate of CBNA’s special assessment of $31 million and $225 million, respectively, recognized in 2024 and 2023. Other operating expense also reflects lower fraud losses and marketing and travel-related expenses. These decreases were partially offset by salaries and employee benefits reflecting hiring related to our Private Bank and Private Wealth build-out and commercial middle market bankers in expansion markets, and equipment and software given technology investments and maintenance.\nFor more information regarding CBNA’s special assessment, see “Regulation and Supervision - Deposit Insurance” in Item 1. \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 44\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to “Analysis of Financial Condition — Credit Quality” for more information.\nProvision expense of $687 million for 2024 was stable compared to 2023. The provision expense for 2024 reflects higher reserves against the CRE office portfolio, primarily driven by elevated interest rates and return-to-office dynamics and unsecured products and education loans given recent inflationary pressures and government actions, partially offset by a decline in total loans and leases.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense of $379 million decreased $43 million and our effective income tax rate of 20.1% decreased from 20.8% compared to 2023. These decreases reflect a higher benefit from tax-advantaged investments.\nBusiness Operating Segments \nWe have three business operating segments: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, and Non-Core.

As described in Note 6, the ACL is maintained at a level the Company believes to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of a loan or lease and on unfunded lending commitments, inclusive of recoveries. We consider extensive historical loss experience, including the impact of loss mitigation and restructuring programs that we offer to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as well as projected loss severity as a result of loan default. \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of the ACL on a quarterly basis. The evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative information is performed by assessing groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics as well as certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group. Loans are generally grouped by product type and are assessed for credit losses using econometric models.\nThe quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. Known and estimated data include current PD, LGD and EAD for commercial loans, timing and amount of expected draws for unfunded lending commitments, and FICO, LTV, and term for retail loans. The mix and level of loan balances, delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings, previous loss experience, current business conditions, amount and timing of expected future cash flows, and factors specific to commercial credits such as competition, business and management performance are also considered. Forward-looking economic assumptions include real GDP, unemployment rate, interest rate curve, and changes in collateral values. Historical information, such as financial statements for commercial customers or consumer credit ratings, may not be as relevant in estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models during volatile economic time periods.\nManagement additionally considers qualitative factors in determining the adequacy of the ACL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the loan and lease portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully reflected within our expected credit loss models. These factors include, but are not limited to: model imprecision, uncertainty in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance, credit underwriting policy exceptions, and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. The consideration of these qualitative items results in adjustments to amounts included in our ACL for each loan portfolio. The qualitative component of the ACL as of December 31, 2024 did not change significantly from December 31, 2023.\nLoans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually assessed for expected credit losses. Nonaccrual commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of $5 million or greater are assessed on an individual basis. Generally, measurement of the ACL on an individual loan or lease is the present value of its future cash flows or the fair value of its underlying collateral, if the loan or lease is collateral dependent.\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. Off-balance sheet financial instruments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to the Company’s internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction with historical loss experience, current and future economic conditions, timing and amount of expected draws, and performance trends within specific portfolio segments, are considered to estimate the allowance for unfunded lending commitments. The Company does not recognize a reserve for future draws from credit lines that are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards).\nFor additional information regarding the ACL, see “Critical Accounting Estimates — Allowance for Credit Losses” and Note 6.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 50\nTable 11: Allocation of the ALLL\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(dollars in millions)\nAllowance\n% of Total Loans and Leases\n(1)\nAllowance\n% of Total Loans and Leases\n(1)\nCommercial and industrial\n$480 \n31 \n%\n$587 \n31 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n660 \n19 \n663 \n20 \nTotal commercial\n1,140 \n50 \n1,250 \n51 \nResidential mortgages\n194 \n24 \n181 \n22 \nHome equity\n112 \n12 \n100 \n10 \nAutomobile\n24 \n3 \n57 \n6 \nEducation\n292 \n8 \n259 \n8 \nOther retail \n299 \n3 \n251 \n3 \nTotal retail\n921 \n50 \n848 \n49 \nTotal loans and leases\n$2,061 \n100 \n%\n$2,098 \n100 \n%\n(1)    \nRepresents the percentage of each loan category to total loans and leases.\nTable 12: ACL and Related Coverage Ratios by Portfolio\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(dollars in millions)\nLoans and Leases\nAllowance\nCoverage\nLoans and Leases\nAllowance\nCoverage\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nCommercial and industrial\n$42,551 \n$480 \n1.13 \n%\n$44,974 \n$587 \n1.31 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n27,225 \n660 \n2.42 \n29,471 \n663 \n2.25 \nTotal commercial\n69,776 \n1,140 \n1.63 \n74,445 \n1,250 \n1.68 \nResidential mortgages\n32,726 \n194 \n0.59 \n31,332 \n181 \n0.58 \nHome equity\n16,495 \n112 \n0.68 \n15,040 \n100 \n0.66 \nAutomobile\n4,744 \n24 \n0.51 \n8,258 \n57 \n0.69 \nEducation\n10,812 \n292 \n2.70 \n11,834 \n259 \n2.18 \nOther retail\n4,650 \n299 \n6.44 \n5,050 \n251 \n4.98 \nTotal retail\n69,427 \n921 \n1.33 \n71,514 \n848 \n1.19 \nTotal loans and leases\n$139,203 \n$2,061 \n1.48 \n%\n$145,959 \n$2,098 \n1.44 \n%\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nCommercial\n(1)\n$155 \n1.86 \n%\n$175 \n1.91 \n%\nRetail\n(2)\n43 \n1.39 \n45 \n1.25 \n     Total allowance for unfunded lending commitments\n198 \n220 \nAllowance for credit losses\n$139,203 \n$2,259 \n1.62 \n%\n$145,959 \n$2,318 \n1.59 \n%\n(1)    \nCoverage ratio includes total commercial allowance for unfunded lending commitments and total commercial allowance for loan and lease losses in the numerator and total commercial loans and leases in the denominator.\n(2)\n Coverage ratio includes total retail allowance for unfunded lending commitments and total retail allowance for loan losses in the numerator and total retail loans in the denominator.\nThe ACL as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 decreased $59 million, driven by a $130 million decline in commercial reflecting lower loan balances and charge-offs.

For more information regarding our borrowed funds, see “Liquidity” and Note 13.\nCAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nAs a BHC and FHC, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. See the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1 for more information.\nCapital Adequacy Process\nOur assessment of capital adequacy begins with our Board-approved risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. Capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies. The assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Key analytical frameworks, including scenario analysis and stress testing, supplement our base line forecast to help inform a range of potential outcomes. A governance framework supports our capital planning process, including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our Capital Contingency Plan and the active engagement of both the Board and senior management in oversight and decision-making.\nForward-looking assessments of capital adequacy provide for the development of a single capital plan, which is periodically submitted to the FRB, that covers both us and our banking subsidiary. We prepare this plan in accordance with the Capital Plan Rule and we participate annually in the FRB’s horizontal capital review as part of their normal supervisory process, which includes an assessment of specific capital planning areas.\nThe FRB regularly supervises and evaluates our capital adequacy and capital planning processes, including the submission of an annual capital plan approved by our Board of Directors or one of its committees. Under the FRB’s capital requirements, we must maintain capital ratios above the sum of the regulatory minimum and SCB requirement to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The FRB utilizes the supervisory stress test to determine our SCB, which is re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing in even-numbered years. Our SCB associated with the 2024 CCAR supervisory stress test was 4.5%, effective October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.\nRegulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule-making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses.\nRegulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition\nUnder the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a BHC, our SCB of 4.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for CBNA.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 56\nFor additional discussion of the U.S. Basel III capital framework and its related application, see the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1. The table below presents the regulatory capital ratios for CFG and CBNA under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules:\nTable 22: Regulatory Capital Ratios Under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Rules\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(dollars in millions)\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nRequired Minimum Capital Ratio\n(1)\nCET1 capital\nCFG\n$17,900 \n10.8 \n%\n$18,358 \n10.6 \n%\n9.0 \n%\nCBNA\n20,250 \n12.3 \n19,411 \n11.3 \n7.0 \nTier 1 capital\nCFG\n20,013 \n12.1 \n20,372 \n11.8 \n10.5 \nCBNA\n20,250 \n12.3 \n19,411 \n11.3 \n8.5 \nTotal capital\nCFG\n23,232 \n14.0 \n23,608 \n13.7 \n12.5 \nCBNA\n23,362 \n14.2 \n22,453 \n13.0 \n10.5 \nTier 1 leverage\nCFG\n20,013 \n9.4 \n20,372 \n9.3 \n4.0 \nCBNA\n20,250 \n9.6 \n19,411 \n8.9 \n4.0 \nRisk-weighted assets\nCFG\n165,699 \n172,601 \nCBNA\n164,986 \n172,094 \nQuarterly adjusted average assets\n(2)\nCFG\n212,555 \n219,591 \nCBNA\n211,849 \n218,974 \n(1) \nRepresents minimum requirement under the current capital framework plus the SCB of 4.5% and CCB of 2.5% for CFG and CBNA, respectively. The SCB and CCB are not applicable to the Tier 1 leverage ratio.\n(2) \nRepresents total average assets less certain amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital.\nAt December 31, 2024, CFG’s CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023. Net income and a $6.9 billion decrease in RWA was partially offset by common share repurchases, dividends, and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the third year of the CECL three-year transition period. Lower commercial and auto loans were the key drivers for the decline in RWA. An increase in preferred stock was also a contributing factor to the tier 1 capital ratio increase. \nAt December 31, 2024, CBNA’s CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023. Net income and a $7.1 billion decrease in RWA, primarily driven by lower commercial and auto loans, was partially offset by dividend payments to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the third year of the CECL three-year transition period.\nAt December 31, 2024, CFG’s and CBNA’s total capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023, driven by their respective changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital described above and a reduction in the modified AACL transition amount.\nAt December 31, 2024, CFG’s and CBNA’s tier 1 leverage ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting a decline in quarterly adjusted average assets and their respective changes in tier 1 capital described above.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 57\nTable 23: Capital Composition Under the U.S. Basel III Capital Framework\n(dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal common stockholders’ equity\n$22,141 \n$22,328 \nExclusions:\nModified CECL transitional amount\n96 \n192 \nNet unrealized (gains)/losses recorded in AOCI, net of tax:\nDebt securities \n2,369 \n2,338 \nDerivatives\n925 \n1,087 \nUnamortized net periodic benefit costs\n301 \n333 \nDeductions:\nGoodwill, net of deferred tax liability\n(7,768)\n(7,779)\nOther intangible assets, net of deferred tax liability\n(128)\n(134)\nDeferred tax assets that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards\n(36)\n(7)\nTotal common equity tier 1 capital\n17,900 \n18,358 \nQualifying preferred stock \n2,113 \n2,014 \nTotal tier 1 capital\n20,013 \n20,372 \nQualifying subordinated debt\n(1)\n1,232 \n1,319 \nAllowance for credit losses\n2,259 \n2,318 \nExclusions from tier 2 capital:\n  Modified AACL transitional amount\n(125)\n(249)\n  Allowance on PCD assets\n(147)\n(152)\nAdjusted allowance for credit losses\n1,987 \n1,917 \nTotal capital\n$23,232 \n$23,608 \n(1) \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of non-qualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was $469 million and $482 million, respectively. See Note 13 for more details on our outstanding subordinated debt.\nCapital Transactions\nWe completed the following capital transactions during 2024:\n•\nRepurchased $1.1 billion of our outstanding common stock;\n•\nIssued 400,000 shares of 7.375% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual Series H Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $400 million;\n•\nRedeemed all outstanding shares of the 9.205% floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock on July 8, 2024;\n•\nDeclared quarterly common stock dividends of $0.42 per share, aggregating to $769 million; and\n•\nDeclared preferred stock dividends aggregating to $137 million.\nFor additional detail regarding our common and preferred stock dividends see Note 17.\nOn June 28, 2024, our Board of Directors increased the capacity of our common share repurchase program to $1.25 billion, an increase of $656 million above the $594 million of capacity remaining under the prior February 2023 authorization. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors prior to execution. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory considerations.\nAOCI Impact on Regulatory Capital\nUnder the current applicable regulatory capital rules we have made the AOCI opt-out election, which enables us to exclude components of AOCI from regulatory capital. As noted in the “Capital and Stress Testing Requirements” section of “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1, the regulatory agencies are considering the inclusion of AOCI components in regulatory capital for Category IV firms like us, notably the AOCI relative to securities and pension.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 58\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios including the AOCI impact from securities and pension, which we believe provides useful information in light of recent events and the potential for change in the regulatory capital framework.\nTable 24: AOCI Impact on Regulatory Capital\nDecember 31, 2024\nCFG\nCBNA\n(dollars in millions)\nCET1\nTier 1\nTotal\nCET1\nTier 1\nTotal\nRegulatory capital, including AOCI impact:\nRegulatory capital (as reported)\n$17,900 \n$20,013 \n$23,232 \n$20,250 \n$20,250 \n$23,362 \nUnrealized gains (losses) on securities and pension\n(2,670)\n(2,670)\n(2,670)\n(2,651)\n(2,651)\n(2,651)\nDeferred tax assets - securities and pension AOCI\n(33)\n(33)\n(33)\n(34)\n(34)\n(34)\nRegulatory capital, including AOCI impact (non-GAAP)\n$15,197 \n$17,310 \n$20,529 \n$17,565 \n$17,565 \n$20,677 \nRisk-weighted assets, including AOCI impact:\nRisk-weighted assets (as reported)\n$165,699 \n$165,699 \n$165,699 \n$164,986 \n$164,986 \n$164,986 \nUnrealized gains (losses) on securities and pension\n(702)\n(702)\n(702)\n(683)\n(683)\n(683)\nDeferred tax assets - securities and pension AOCI\n2,198 \n2,198 \n2,198 \n2,179 \n2,179 \n2,179 \nRisk-weighted assets, including AOCI impact  (non-GAAP)\n$167,195 \n$167,195 \n$167,195 \n$166,482 \n$166,482 \n$166,482 \nRatio:\nRegulatory capital ratio (as reported)\n10.8 \n%\n12.1 \n%\n14.0 \n%\n12.3 \n%\n12.3 \n%\n14.2 \n%\nRegulatory capital ratio, including AOCI impact  (non-GAAP)\n9.1 \n%\n10.4 \n%\n12.3 \n%\n10.6 \n%\n10.6 \n%\n12.4 \n%\nLIQUIDITY \nWe consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our safety and soundness. We define liquidity as our ability to meet our obligations when they come due. As a financial institution, we must maintain operating liquidity to meet expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. Reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality liquid securities and unused FHLB borrowing capacity. Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. We maintain additional secured borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window, but do not view this as a primary means of funding, but rather a potential source in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity. \nParent Company Liquidity \nOur Parent Company’s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA resulting from investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior debt and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company relies on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Parent Company completed the following transactions:\n•\nIssued $1.25 billion of 5.841% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2030;\n•\nIssued $750 million of 6.645% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2035;\n•\nIssued 400,000 shares of 7.375% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual Series H Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $400 million;\n•\nRedeemed all outstanding shares of the 9.205% floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock on July 8, 2024; and\n•\nIssued $1.25 billion of 5.718% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2032.\nOur Parent Company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 59\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024\n \nand 2023, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $769 million and $808 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $137 million and $117 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Parent Company repurchased $1.1 billion of its outstanding common stock.\nCBNA Liquidity \nAs CBNA’s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. In the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under “Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.” The primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA relies on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA’s outstanding debt see Note 13.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, CBNA completed the following transactions: \n•\nIssued $2.7 billion of secured borrowings collateralized by loans;\n•\nRedeemed $650 million of 4.119%\n \nfixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025; and\n•\nRedeemed $600 million of 6.064%\n \nfixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025.\nLiquidity Risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they come due. We must maintain adequate funding to meet current and future obligations, including customer loan requests, deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases, and other cash commitments, under both normal operating conditions and periods of company-specific and/or market stress.\nWe rely on customer deposits to be our primary stable and low-cost source of funding. Our funding sources also include our ability to securitize loans in secondary markets, raise funds in the debt and equity capital markets, pledge loans and/or securities for borrowing from the FHLB, pledge securities as collateral for borrowing under repurchase agreements, and sell AFS securities.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 60\nCredit ratings assigned by agencies such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch impact our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large uninsured customer deposits and are presented in the table below.\nTable 25: Credit Ratings\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nMoody’s\n  \nStandard and\nPoor’s\nFitch\n  \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc.:\n \n \n \nLong-term issuer\nBaa1\nBBB+\nBBB+\nShort-term issuer\nNR\nA-2\nF1\nSubordinated debt\nBaa1\nBBB\nBBB\nPreferred Stock\nBaa3\nBB+\nBB\nCitizens Bank, National Association:\nLong-term issuer\nA3\nA-\nBBB+\nShort-term issuer\n(P) P-2\nA-2\nF1\nLong-term deposits\nA1\nNR\nA-\nShort-term deposits\nP-1\nNR\nF1\nNR = Not Rated\nWe currently have a “stable” outlook at Standard & Poor’s, a “negative” outlook at Moody’s and a “positive” outlook at Fitch. Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding.\nExisting and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB and OCC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see the “Liquidity Requirements” section under “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1.\nLiquidity Risk Management and Governance \nLiquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. The Funding and Liquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity risk. Processes within this framework include, but are not limited to, regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies, liquidity stress testing, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. \nOur Funding and Liquidity unit’s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. We seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits, by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding, and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities.\nWe maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. The plan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow, including notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 61\nAs of December 31, 2024:\n•\nOrganically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated period-end loans-to-deposits ratio, excluding LHFS, of 79.6%;\n◦\nEstimated insured/secured deposits comprise 67% of our consolidated deposit base of $174.8 billion.\n•\nOur total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $83.1 billion; \n◦\nContingent liquidity was $66.2 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $36.0 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $21.1 billion, and our cash balances at the FRB of $9.1 billion; and\n◦\nAvailable discount window capacity was $16.9 billion, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, which is primarily secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans.\nFor a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8.\nThe Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows:\n•\nCurrent liquidity sources and capacities, including cash balances at the FRB, free and liquid securities, and secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB discount window; \n•\nLiquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and \n•\nCurrent and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons. \nFurther, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, lease obligations and other cash commitments. For more information regarding these obligations, see Notes 9, 12 and 13.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are generally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” For more information on these types of activities, see Note 19.    \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAn accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. See Note 1 for further discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 62\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2024 remained stable compared to December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the ACL economic forecast over a two-year reasonable and supportable period was consistent with December 31, 2023, with peak unemployment of approximately 5.1% and start-to-trough real GDP decline of approximately 0.4%. These forecasts reflect a mild recession over the two-year reasonable and supportable period.\nOur determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. To illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which reflects deeper real GDP contraction across our two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period with peak unemployment of approximately 6.0% and start-to-trough real GDP decline of approximately 2.0%. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.2x our modeled period-end ACL, or an increase of approximately $400 million. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end ACL, which includes qualitative adjustments.\nBecause several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity analysis is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates.\nIt remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product type. The variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy, including changing monetary and fiscal policies, impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry, and their impact on inflationary trends. Changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact on our estimation of expected credit losses.\nFor additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 6.\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value. Business combinations typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the goodwill has been attributed. At December 31, 2024, goodwill totaled $8.2 billion and is assigned to our reporting units as follows: $5.5 billion to Commercial Banking and $2.7 billion to Consumer Banking.\nThe process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective, involving management assumptions, estimates and forecasts, and the use of external or internal valuations. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow and market approach analysis. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the quantitative impairment test estimated the fair value of the reporting units using an equal weighting of an income approach (i.e., discounted cash flows method) and market-based approach (i.e., the guideline public company method). The guideline public company method utilizes comparable public company information and key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable.\nUnder the income approach, cash flow projections are based on multi-year financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit that consider key business drivers such as new business initiatives, customer retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, fees and expenses, forward interest rates, historical performance, credit performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. The projection of net interest income and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking reporting units. Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 63\nWe performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024 as part of our annual impairment assessment. Based on this quantitative assessment, we concluded that the estimated fair value of the Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units exceeded their carrying value; therefore, goodwill is not impaired.  \nFor additional information regarding Goodwill, see Note 10.\nFair Value\nWe assess the fair value of assets and liabilities by applying various valuation methodologies which may involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued. Quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of certain assets such as trading assets, investment securities and residential real estate LHFS. Assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of items for which an observable active market does not exist and include discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different fair value estimates, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or fair value disclosures.\nWe also assess whether there are any declines in fair value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including certain investments, loans, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets.\nFor additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see Note 20.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 64\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nAccounting standards issued but not adopted as of December 31, 2024\nPronouncement\nSummary of Guidance\nEffects on Financial Statements\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIssued December 2023\n•\nRequires an annual income tax rate reconciliation table that includes specific categories and other significant categories, disaggregated by nature, that exceed 5% of income tax expense at the statutory tax rate\n•\nRequires a qualitative description of the states and local jurisdictions that make up more than 50% of the effect of the state and local income tax category\n•\nRequires description of the nature, effect and underlying causes of the reconciling items and the judgment used in categorizing these items\n•\nRequires annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds received, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, and further disaggregated by individual jurisdictions that exceed 5% of total income taxes paid, net of refunds received\n•\nRequires disclosure of 1) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign, and 2) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign\n•\nEliminates the requirement to disclose the nature and estimate of the change in unrecognized tax benefits expected in the next twelve months\n•\nEliminates the requirement to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a deferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures\n•\nRequired effective date: Annual financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2025.

A key aspect of our Board’s responsibility as the main decision-making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood. \nTo enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the Executive Risk Committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk, Model Risk, Credit Policy, Asset Liability, Business Initiatives Review, and Conduct and Ethics. \nRisk Framework \nOur risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “Three Lines of Defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities.\nFirst Line of Defense\n \nThe business lines, including their associated support functions, are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying, assessing, managing, and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide. The business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis, establishing and documenting operating procedures, and establishing a governance structure for identifying and managing risk. \nSecond Line of Defense\n \nThe second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for the development of risk and control frameworks and related policies, and their associated implementation. This centralized risk function is independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including, but not limited to, credit, market, operational, regulatory, reputational, interest rate, liquidity, legal and strategic risks. \nThird Line of Defense\n \nOur Internal Audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance of the effectiveness of our internal controls and governance practices so that risk is managed appropriately for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. Internal Audit has complete and unrestricted access to all of our records, physical properties and personnel. Internal Audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the Board’s Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. \nCredit Review reports to the Chief Audit Executive and provides the Board, senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed Credit Risk Appetite and Credit Policies and processes. In line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the Credit Review function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four Risk Pillars of Asset Quality, Rating and Data Integrity, Risk Management and Credit Risk Appetite. \nRisk Appetite \nRisk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. We define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations. \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 66\nOur principal non-market risks include credit, operational, regulatory, reputational, liquidity and strategic risks. We are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including interest rate hedging, foreign exchange risk and non-trading activities within capital markets. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report on market risk. We actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. See “Market Risk” for further information. Our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the Board Risk Committee. \nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the potential for loss arising from the failure of a customer, counterparty, or issuer to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of an obligation. While the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. Given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval and management of credit risk represents a significant part of our overall risk-management responsibility. \nOur independent Credit Risk Function is responsible for reviewing and approving the credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products, approving larger and higher-risk credit transactions, monitoring portfolio performance, identifying problem credit exposures, and ensuring remedial management. Credit Risk actively monitors and manages concentrations of loan limits, loan types, industries, and geographies to ensure that our risk appetite is well balanced to achieve our goals.\nManagement and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of each respective business line and the second line of defense. Our second line of defense, the independent Credit Risk Function, is led by the Chief Credit Officer who oversees all credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer, acting in a manner consistent with Board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around policies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits and authority delegation. The Chief Credit Officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher-risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities. Reporting to the Chief Credit Officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, Private Banking, Citizens Restructuring Management, Portfolio and Corporate Reporting, ACL Analytics, Current Expected Credit Loss, and Credit Policy and Administration. Each team under these leaders is composed of experienced credit professionals. \nThe primary mechanisms that govern our risk management include, but are not limited to, credit assessments, models, scorecards, credit limits, exposure management, concentration limits, balance sheet diversification, portfolio management, collateral requirements and individual credit policies tailored for Consumer and Commercial lending. Our policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards and their alignment with our desired risk appetite. Material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the Credit Policy Committee, Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee for approval, as appropriate.\nWe employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle including origination, account/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery. \nConsumer\nWe utilize several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional branch lending and mobile and online banking. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity includes unique credit risk characteristics, with loan pricing commensurate with the differing risk profiles. Consumer credit approvals are typically based on the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of exposure, and transaction structure, among other factors.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 67\nLending authority is granted to each first line approver by the second line of defense credit risk function to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams. We periodically evaluate the performance of each first line approver and annually reauthorize their delegated authority. Only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk function are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies, which are not uncommon when compensating factors are present. Established exception limits, when reached or exceeded, trigger a comprehensive analysis.\nFor Consumer Banking, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across their life cycle. Credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant prior to origination. When approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value, collateral type, and lien subordination.\nOur consumer banking portfolio is comprised of five categories of loans to consumers: residential mortgages, home equity, education, automobile, and other retail.\nResidential Mortgages and Home Equity\nResidential mortgages are loans to consumers to purchase or refinance 1-4 family residential properties and are generally structured with repayment terms ranging from 15 to 30 years. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate (traditional and interest-only) residential mortgages, with the properties securing such mortgages primarily located within our geographic footprint. We do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or multiple payment options. Residential mortgage applications are underwritten using consistent credit policies and processes, with a focus on higher-quality borrowers.\nResidential mortgages are originated based on an appraisal completed during the credit underwriting process, with borrower performance tracked monthly by segmenting the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type. The portfolio is also segmented based upon delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations as part of our overall risk management analysis and monitoring.\nHome equity loans primarily include lines of credit secured by a first- or second-lien on the borrower’s residence, which enable the customer to borrow against the equity in their home or refinance existing mortgage debt. The product is a variable-rate, interest-only line of credit that allows the borrower to draw against the available line with no required principal payments during an initial 10-year revolving period. At the end of the revolving period, the home equity line of credit converts into a 15-year amortizing structure.\nHome equity applications are underwritten using full income and credit standards with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and combined LTV ratios utilizing current collateral valuations. The underwriting for variable-rate lines of credit also incorporates a stress analysis for rising interest rates. We actively manage lines of credit and adjust their lending limit when we believe it is necessary based on a borrower’s FICO score and any associated credit deterioration.\nBorrower performance of the home equity portfolio is tracked on a monthly basis for internal reporting and risk management purposes by segmenting the portfolio into pools, which are typically based on origination vintage tranches. The performance of any related mortgage loans is also tracked regardless of whether we hold a lien on such loans. A third-party service provider is utilized to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from both public and private sources.\nLTV information on our outstanding residential mortgages and home equity portfolios is updated quarterly based on a combination of automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding principal balance to the current property value estimate. For home equity and second mortgages, CLTV is the ratio of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance combined to the current property value estimate.\nProperty values for both residential mortgages and home equity loans are refreshed quarterly after an account is established to allow for proactive identification of changing levels of credit risk and to facilitate our portfolio management, including workout and loss mitigation functions. Our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 68\nEducation\nThe education portfolio is primarily comprised of two products, in-school loans and education refinance loans. An in-school loan is generally financed over a 5, 10, or 15-year term and provides for fixed or variable rate financing to students while enrolled in school, with the option to pay while in school or to defer payment until after graduation. An education refinance loan provides a refinancing option on an existing education loan for students and parents, with 5 to 20-year terms and fixed or variable rates.\nThe performance of the education portfolio is measured monthly, including updated FICO, or equivalent, scores. We analyze the portfolio by product channel and type, and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience for internal reporting and risk management purposes.\nAutomobile\nThe automobile portfolio consists of loans originated primarily through independent franchised dealers, including some located in select states outside of our primary geographic footprint. This portfolio is in runoff as we discontinued the origination of automobile loans in 2023.\nThe performance of the automobile loan portfolio is measured monthly, including updated collateral values and FICO, or equivalent, scores. We analyze the portfolio by product channel and type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience for internal reporting and risk management purposes.\nOther Retail\nOther retail loans primarily consist of unsecured consumer lending products, including credit cards and point-of-sale loans originated through partnerships with third-party companies. These loans are underwritten in accordance with our established credit policies and guidelines. Certain point-of-sale loans originated with third-party companies include credit loss protection agreements provided by those companies, which mitigate our risk of loss. Given the variable nature of the credit card portfolio, we actively monitor interest rate impacts and portfolio performance to ensure alignment with our risk tolerance.\nCommercial\nOur commercial banking portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases, and commercial real estate loans.\nFor Commercial Banking, risk management includes defined credit products and policies and is separated into commercial and industrial loans, CRE and leases. Separate verticals are established within commercial and industrial loans and leases for certain specialty products. Substantially all activity that falls under a defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical and a stand-alone team of industry, product, and credit risk specialists. CRE also operates as a specialty vertical. \nCommercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval before origination and, with few exceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. The underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that establish the probability of default and loss given default. Material transactions require both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority as determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the probability of default. Checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, actively monitor the portfolio to facilitate the early recognition of credit problems, and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. Authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent Credit Risk Function and is closely monitored and updated annually, at a minimum. \nThe primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, geography, transaction structure including loan covenants, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. In addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process before origination and during an annual review, our Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations. This group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings, as well as tests the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management. \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 69\nCredit exposure to individual borrowers is managed by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower, or related group of borrowers, with concentration risk managed through limits on industry sectors, asset classes and loan quality factors.  \nOur standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment. Substantially all loans categorized as Classified are managed by Citizens Restructuring Management, a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day-to-day management of loan workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales to reduce losses and maximize recoveries. Their responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the adequacy of the ACL, accrual status, and ultimate collectability of the Classified loan portfolio.\nCommercial and Industrial\nThe commercial and industrial portfolio includes both loans and leases made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, capital call facilities, or other projects/acquisitions. The loans and leases are generally underwritten individually to assess the quality of multiple sources of repayment including cash flow for debt service, collateral, and any guarantees from the business owner. Although real estate exists as collateral for these loans, the operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source. \nThe risks inherent in the commercial and industrial portfolio are managed through origination policies, a defined loan concentration policy with established limits, ongoing loan- and portfolio-level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. Our origination policies for the commercial and industrial portfolio include policies specific to loan product type, such as LTV and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable.\nCommercial Real Estate\nThe CRE portfolio consists of both commercial property and construction loans that support a wide range of property development and investment activities including, but not limited to, multi-family, office spaces, industrial facilities, and retail shopping centers. These loans are typically repaid through cash flows generated from the operation, sale, or refinance of the property. Risk on these loans is mitigated by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement.\nOur CRE construction portfolio primarily consists of multi-family, warehouse, office and data center property types. Loans in this portfolio are generally for construction projects that have been pre-sold or pre-leased, have secured permanent financing, or are made to real estate companies with significant equity invested in the project. A specialized real estate lending group is responsible for this portfolio and actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule. Construction loans, which are generally short term in nature, are utilized to fund the development or renovation of real estate, with repayment often tied to the successful completion and stabilization of the property.\nRisks inherent in this portfolio are managed by focusing on the financial strength and experience of the developer, market conditions and other specific attributes associated with each project. We limit our loan amounts based on appraised values, minimum equity investments by our borrowers, and adequate cash flows to support the debt. \nBoth macro- and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecasted market conditions are part of the ongoing portfolio management process for the CRE portfolio. Ongoing portfolio-level reviews are performed that generate action plans based on occupancy levels or leasing revenues associated with the projects being reviewed. This highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as an in-depth knowledge of CRE project lending and the current market environment.\nProperty-type concentrations and both geographic and property-type performance metrics are actively monitored for all CRE loan types, with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on our risk rating methodology. The portfolio is diversified by property type and loan size, representing a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. Subsequent to the origination, the Credit Review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk from new loan originations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 70\nAppraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as-needed basis, to both comply with regulatory requirements and to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio with respect to changing market conditions. Appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group, which is composed of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process.\nMARKET RISK\nMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, the market risk arising from our non-trading banking activities, such as the origination of loans and deposit-gathering, is more significant. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities.\nNon-Trading Risk \nOur non-trading banking activities expose us to market risk. This market risk is composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and equity. We refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book.”\nA major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity. There are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/or repricing of assets and liabilities. There may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes. Loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as SOFR or Prime, while deposits may not be as correlated with such rates and more dependent upon competitive demand. Due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates.\nA primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating-rate loans relative to core deposit funding. This source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve.\nThe secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed-rate loans, as well as prepayment risk on mortgage-related loans and securities funded by non-rate sensitive deposits and equity. \nAnother important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. For example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty. The exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above.\nThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short- and long-term horizons. To ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite, we measure the exposure and hedge it, as necessary. The Treasury Asset and Liability Management team is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position. These exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the Asset Liability Committee and at Board meetings. \nWe measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short- and long-term exposures. The primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a three-year horizon. Exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across these scenarios. \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 71\nKey assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, changes in product balances and the behavior of our loan and deposit customers in different rate environments. Repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities, as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments are the most significant behavioral assumptions. We utilize product level models that consider specific product characteristics and composition of the deposit portfolio, along with current and forward-looking market dynamics, to project deposit rates. Similarly, we employ dynamic prepayment and mortgage rate models to project prepayment behaviors specific to each of our product offerings. These models are developed based on internal performance data over prior interest rate cycles and calibrated to our experience and outlook for rates across a diverse set of market environments. We assess our models and assumptions periodically by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of changes to inputs or assumptions on our risk results, which are reported to the Asset Liability Committee.\nSince we cannot predict the future path of interest rates, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” (implied forward) scenario, as well as a variety of extreme and unlikely scenarios. These scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short- or long-term rates predominate. Generally, projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market-forward rates are realized. \nThe table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and, therefore, have a more modest impact. \nTable 26: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income\nEstimated % Change in\nNet Interest Income over 12 Months\nDecember 31,\nBasis points\n2024\n2023\nInstantaneous Change in Interest Rates\n \n \n+200\n1.8 \n%\n— \n%\n+100\n1.1 \n0.5 \n-100\n(1.3)\n(1.5)\n-200\n(3.3)\n(3.0)\nGradual Change in Interest Rates\n+200\n2.2 \n%\n0.4 \n%\n+100\n1.0 \n0.5 \n-100\n(0.9)\n(1.0)\n-200\n(1.8)\n(1.9)\nWe continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy, changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet. The Company’s base case net interest income assumes the forward-rate path implied by the period-end yield curve is realized. The rate risk exposure is then measured based on assumed changes from that base case rate path.\nOur risk position is slightly asset sensitive to a gradual change in rates as of December 31, 2024, compared to our broadly neutral position as of December 31, 2023.  Our interest rate sensitivity incorporates the impacts of changes in our balance sheet mix, including securities, loans, deposits, borrowed funds and hedge activity, which is primarily comprised of received fixed swaps that offset our naturally asset-sensitive balance sheet.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 72\nWe use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, EVE, as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. We employ sophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition, which provide a granular view of cash flows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments. The change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital. \nWe use interest rate contracts as part of our ALM strategy to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and wholesale funding, the variability in the fair value of AFS securities, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.\nThe following table presents interest rate derivative contracts that we have entered into as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTable 27: Interest Rate Hedges Used to Manage Non-Trading Interest Rate Exposure\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted Average\nWeighted Average\n(dollars in millions)\nNotional Amount\nMaturity (Years)\nFixed Rate\nReset Rate \nNotional Amount\nMaturity (Years)\nFixed Rate\nReset Rate\nFair value hedges:\nAsset conversion swaps:\nAFS securities:\nPay fixed/receive SOFR\n$7,827 \n4.7 \n3.8 \n%\n4.5 \n%\n$5,365 \n6.2 \n3.8 \n%\n5.4 \n%\nLiability conversion swaps:\nLong-term borrowed funds:\nReceive fixed/pay SOFR\n500 \n0.9 \n2.6 \n4.8 \n500 \n1.9 \n2.6 \n5.6 \nTotal fair value hedges\n8,327 \n5,865 \nCash flow hedges:\nAsset conversion swaps:\nLoans:\nSwaps\nReceive fixed/pay SOFR\n26,250 \n1.7 \n3.1 \n4.5 \n17,780 \n0.8 \n4.0 \n5.4 \nReceive fixed/pay SOFR - forward-starting\n20,000 \n3.5 \n3.7 \n4.0 \n31,250 \n2.9 \n3.3 \n4.6 \nBasis swaps\nReceive SOFR/pay 1-month term SOFR\n11,500 \n1.6 \n— \n4.5/4.3\n5,000 \n1.0 \n— \n5.3/5.3\nReceive SOFR/pay 1-month term SOFR - forward-starting\n3,000 \n2.4 \n— \n4.0/4.0\n14,000 \n2.7 \n— \n5.2/5.1\nFloor Rate\nCap Rate\nFloor Rate\nCap Rate\nOptions\nInterest rate collars\n(1)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n1,000 \n1.5 \n2.5 \n3.7 \nInterest rate collars - forward-starting\n(1)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n500 \n2.5 \n2.7 \n4.4 \nFloor spreads - forward-starting\n(2)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n2,500 \n2.8 \n2.2/3.2\n— \nTotal cash flow hedges\n60,750 \n72,030 \nTotal hedges\n$69,077 \n$77,895 \n(1)\n Weighted average floor and cap rates represent strike rates through which CFG will receive interest if the SOFR rate falls below the floor strike rate and pay interest if the SOFR rate exceeds the cap strike rate.\n(2) \nWeighted average floor rate represents strike rates for the short and long interest rate floors, respectively.

These losses could differ from amounts recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges after December 31, 2024.\nIncluded in AOCI is a net loss from terminated swaps of $732 million that will reduce net interest income by $127 million in the first quarter of 2025, $119 million in the second quarter of 2025, $109 million in the third quarter of 2025, and $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2025. The remaining $274 million will reduce net interest income by $230 million in 2026 and $44 million after 2026.\nCapital Markets\nA key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, potential loss, and sub-limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve.\nAs part of our overall risk management strategy we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value of our MSRs. For more information regarding the fair value of our MSRs and associated derivatives see Note 8 and Note 14.\nAs with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk consistent with the definition used by banking regulators.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 74\nTrading Risk \nWe are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities from certain derivative and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. Market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in interest rates, basis spreads, volatility, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads across various financial instruments. Securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through CBNA and Citizens JMP Securities, LLC.\nClient facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives, financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure. In addition, we operate trading desks covering secondary loans, corporate bonds, and equity securities, with the objective of meeting secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients. We do not engage in any trading activities to benefit from short-term price differences. \nMarket Risk Governance\n \nThe process of setting our market risk limit is established in accordance with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy, which reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume. Dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise. A dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business and/or trading desk is permitted to operate, which is reviewed annually at a minimum. Dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile, with responsibility for remaining within established tolerances residing with the business. Key risk indicators, including VaR, open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored daily and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to the appropriate business line management and risk counterparts.\nMarket Risk Measurement\nWe use VaR as a statistical measure for estimating the potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions. Our VaR framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same. Risk management VaR is based on a one-day holding period to a 99% confidence level and regulatory VaR is based on a ten-day holding period to the same confidence level. In addition to VaR, non-statistical measurements for measuring risk such as sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing are employed. \nOur market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our “covered positions” and allow for aggregation of market risk across products, risk types, business lines and legal entities. We measure, monitor and report market risk for management and regulatory capital purposes. \nVaR Overview\nThe market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. The VaR measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (General VaR) such as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. It is calculated on the basis that current positions remain relatively unaltered over the course of a given holding period with the assumption that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if required, within this holding period. Based on the composition of our “covered positions,” we also use a standardized add-on approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks’ Specific Risk capital, which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. The General VaR approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. The internal VaR measure, used as the basis of the main VaR trading limits, is a 99% confidence level with a one-day holding period, indicating that a loss greater than the VaR is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100 trading days (i.e., 1% of the time). Theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than VaR two to three times per year. The regulatory measure of VaR is a 99% confidence level with a ten-day holding period. The historical market data applied to calculate the VaR is updated on a two-business day lag. Refer to “Market Risk Regulatory Capital” below for details of our ten-day VaR metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 75\nMarket Risk Regulatory Capital\n \nThe U.S. banking regulators’ “Market Risk Rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital. Under this rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as “covered positions.” The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR. \nTable 30: Results of Modeled and Non-Modeled Measures for Regulatory Capital Calculations\n(dollars in millions)\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31, 2024\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nMarket Risk Category\n \nPeriod End\nAverage\n \nHigh\nLow\nPeriod End\nAverage\n \nHigh\nLow\nInterest Rate\n$2 \n$1 \n$3 \n$1 \n$3 \n$3 \n$5 \n$2 \nForeign Exchange Currency Rate\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n2 \n— \nCredit Spread\n2 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n1 \nCommodity\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nGeneral VaR\n3 \n2 \n3 \n1 \n4 \n4 \n6 \n3 \nSpecific Risk VaR\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal VaR\n$3 \n$2 \n$3 \n$1 \n$4 \n$4 \n$6 \n$3 \nStressed General VaR\n$7 \n$7 \n$12 \n$4 \n$4 \n$7 \n$14 \n$3 \nStressed Specific Risk VaR\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal Stressed VaR\n$7 \n$7 \n$12 \n$4 \n$4 \n$7 \n$14 \n$3 \nMarket Risk Regulatory Capital\n$28 \n$33 \nSpecific Risk Not Modeled Add-on\n25 \n17 \nde Minimis Exposure Add-on\n— \n1 \nTotal Market Risk Regulatory Capital\n$53 \n$51 \nMarket Risk-Weighted Assets\n$665 \n$643 \nStressed VaR\n \nSVaR is an extension of VaR and utilizes a longer historical look-back horizon, fixed from January 3, 2005, to identify headline risks from more volatile periods and to provide a counterbalance to VaR, which may be low during periods of low volatility. The holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days. In addition to its utilization for risk management purposes, SVaR is a component of market risk regulatory capital. We calculate SVaR daily under its own dynamic window regime whereby values of the ten-day, 99% VaR are calculated over all 260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. Refer to “Market Risk Regulatory Capital” above for SVaR metrics.\nSensitivity Analysis\n \nSensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange exposures, option prices and credit spreads. Since VaR is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations.\nStress Testing\n \nConducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. For historical stress tests, profit and loss results are simulated for select time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns, while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk-measurement methodologies. Hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves occur simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold. Stress tests of our trading positions are generated daily.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 76\nVaR Model Review and Validation\n \nOur market risk measurement models are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners. This independent review and validation focuses on model methodology, market data and performance and is the responsibility of Citizens’ Model Risk Management and Validation team. This team challenges the assumptions used and quantitative techniques employed, including the theoretical justification supporting them, and performs an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. The quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions is estimated (e.g., through developing alternative models), if possible. The market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior. The Market Risk Management and Validation team conducts internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to market data mapping.\nVaR Backtesting\n \nBacktesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a comparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual, aggregated net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). Any observed loss in excess of the combined portfolio’s VaR number is taken as an exception. The number of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the VaR and SVaR-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable.
