Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\n Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \n\n\nForward-looking Statements\n \n\n\nThis report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “trend,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “pipeline,” “believe,” “comfortable,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “current,” “intention,” “estimate,” “position,” “assume,” “outlook,” “continue,” “remain,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve,” and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may” and similar expressions.\n \n\n\nBlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time and may contain information that is not purely historical in nature. Such information may include, among other things, projections and forecasts. There is no guarantee that any forecasts made will come to pass. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.\n\n\nBlackRock has previously disclosed risk factors in its Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports. These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this report, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance and include: (1) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (2) changes and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management (“AUM”); (3) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRock’s investment products; (4) BlackRock’s ability to develop new products and services that address client preferences; (5) the impact of increased competition; (6) the impact of recent or future acquisitions or divestitures, including the planned acquisitions of HPS Investment Partners (“HPS” or the “HPS Transaction”) and Preqin Holdings Limited (“Preqin” or the “Preqin Transaction”), and the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Management, LLC (“GIP” or the ”GIP Transaction” and together with the HPS Transaction and the Preqin Transaction, the “Transactions”); (7) BlackRock’s ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully, including the Transactions; (8) risks related to the HPS Transaction and the Preqin Transaction, including delays in the expected closing date of the HPS Transaction or the Preqin Transaction, the possibility that either or both of the HPS Transaction or the Preqin Transaction do not close, including, but not limited to, due to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; the possibility that expected synergies and value creation from the HPS Transaction or the Preqin Transaction will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period; and the risk of impacts to business and operational relationships related to disruptions from the HPS Transaction or the Preqin Transaction; (9) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (10) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (11) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property, data, information and cybersecurity protection; (12) the failure to effectively manage the development and use of artificial intelligence; (13) attempts to circumvent BlackRock’s operational control environment or the potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems; (14) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies and governmental scrutiny relating to BlackRock; (15) changes in law and policy and uncertainty pending any such changes; (16) any failure to effectively manage conflicts of interest; (17) damage to BlackRock’s reputation; (18) increasing focus from stakeholders regarding environmental and social matters; (19) geopolitical unrest, terrorist activities, civil or international hostilities, and other events outside BlackRock’s control, including wars, natural disasters and health crises, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries or BlackRock; (20) climate-related risks to BlackRock’s business, products, operations and clients; (21) the ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified professionals; (22) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRock’s economic investments; (23) the impact of changes to tax legislation, including income, payroll and transaction taxes, and taxation on products, which could affect the value proposition to clients and, generally, the tax position of BlackRock; (24) BlackRock’s success in negotiating distribution arrangements and maintaining distribution channels for its products; (25) the failure by key third-party providers to fulfill their obligations to BlackRock; (26) operational, technological and regulatory risks associated with BlackRock’s major technology partnerships; (27) any disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) platform; (28) the impact of BlackRock electing to provide support to its products from time to time and any potential liabilities related to securities lending or other indemnification obligations; and (29) the impact of problems, instability or failure of other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products offered by other financial institutions.\n\n\nOverview\n \n\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $11.6 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2024. With approximately 21,100 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. For further information see Note 1, \nBusiness Overview\n, and Note 27, \nSegment Information\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8.\n \n\n\nOn October 1, 2024, BlackRock completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of GIP for a total consideration, at close, of approximately $3 billion in cash and 6.9 million shares, valued at $5.9 billion. The remaining deferred consideration, all in stock, initially valued at $4.2 billion, is subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing events. As a result of the closing of the GIP Transaction, BlackRock, Inc. (formerly known as BlackRock Funding, Inc.) (“New BlackRock”) became the ultimate parent company of BlackRock Finance, Inc. (formerly known as BlackRock, Inc.) (“Old BlackRock”), GIP and their respective subsidiaries. In addition, New BlackRock became the publicly listed company and retained the ticker symbol “BLK”. References herein to BlackRock or the Company for any period (1) prior to the closing of the GIP Transaction on October 1, 2024 refer to Old BlackRock and (2) thereafter refer to New BlackRock. For additional information related to this reorganization, see Note 1, \nBusiness Overview \nand Note 3, \nAcquisitions\n in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8.\n \n\n\nIn May 2024, BlackRock completed the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in SpiderRock Advisors (“SRA”), a leading provider of customized option overlay strategies in the United States (“US”) wealth market (the \"SpiderRock Transaction\"). This transaction expands on BlackRock’s minority investment in SRA made in 2021 and reinforces BlackRock’s commitment to personalized separately managed accounts.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn June 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Preqin, a leading independent provider of private markets data, for £2.55 billion (or approximately $3.2 billion based on the GBP/USD foreign exchange rate at December 31, 2024) in cash. The Company believes bringing together Preqin's data and research tools with the complementary workflows of Aladdin and eFront in a unified platform will create a preeminent private markets technology and data provider. The Preqin Transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\n\nIn December 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the business and assets of HPS, a leading global credit investment manager with 100% of the consideration paid in BlackRock equity. The equity will generally be delivered in units of a wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock (“SubCo Units”) which will be exchangeable on a one-for-one basis (subject to certain adjustments) into BlackRock common stock (accordingly, the value of each unit delivered will be based on the price of a share of BlackRock’s common stock and the specific terms of the SubCo Units). Approximately 9.2 million SubCo Units and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") will be paid at closing. Approximately 2.9 million SubCo Units, will be paid in approximately five years, subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing conditions. In addition, there is potential for additional consideration to be earned of up to 1.6 million SubCo Units that is based on financial performance milestones measured and paid in approximately five years. Of the total deal consideration, up to 0.7 million units will be used to fund an equity retention pool for HPS employees. In aggregate, inclusive of all SubCo Units paid at closing, eligible to be paid in approximately five years, and potentially earned through achievement of financial performance milestones as well as BlackRock RSUs to be issued in the transaction, the maximum amount of common stock issuable upon exchange of such SubCo Units would be approximately 13.7 million shares. The Company expects the addition of HPS will create an integrated private credit platform to provide both public and private income solutions for clients across their whole portfolios. The HPS Transaction is anticipated to close in mid-2025 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\n\n\nThe following discussion includes a comparison of BlackRock’s results for 2024 and 2023. For a discussion of BlackRock’s results for 2022 and a comparison of results for 2023 and 2022, see Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\n of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024.\n\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\n\nBlackRock’s strategy continues to be guided by the Company's clients' needs and focus on the long-term, which the Company believes better enables it to deliver durable returns for shareholders and create value for all of its stakeholders. BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments and provide clients with choice in how they seek to achieve their unique financial goals. BlackRock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, private markets, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. In addition, BlackRock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the Aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, as well as investors in ETFs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. The diversity of BlackRock’s platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. BlackRock’s long-term strategy remains to keep alpha at the heart of BlackRock; drive growth in ETFs, private markets, and technology; be the global leader in sustainable investing; and lead as a whole portfolio advisor.\n\n\nBlackRock's framework for long-term shareholder value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management.\n\n\nBlackRock has invested to serve the full breadth of client needs. Clients increasingly want to build portfolios that are seamlessly integrated across public and private markets, and that are underpinned by data, risk management and technology. The Company is differentiated in being able to deliver across public and private markets, equity and debt, and in the way that best serves each client – from broad-based ETFs to customized whole portfolio solutions. The Company also offers its Aladdin technology to support integrated public-private portfolios.\n\n\n2024 was a milestone year of organic and inorganic programmatic actions grounded in client needs, investment capability expansion, technology and scale. Clients entrusted BlackRock with a record $641 billion of net inflows in 2024, led by two consecutive record flows quarters in the second half of the year. The Company’s closing of the GIP transaction and planned acquisitions of HPS and Preqin are expected to expand and enhance private markets investment and data capabilities.\n\n\nBlackRock expects 2025 to be a dynamic investing environment. Mega forces like artificial intelligence (\"AI\") and an ongoing evolution in debt financing are transforming economies and their long-term growth trajectories. Capital markets will play a key role in these transformations. Private markets assets are an increasingly vital part of capital markets, and blending both public and private markets will be critical in fully capturing growth opportunities.\n\n\nBlackRock is well-positioned to capitalize on structural growth opportunities against a backdrop of economic and capital markets evolution. The Company has made coordinated investments to build the premier long-term capital partner and technology provider across public and private markets. The acquisition of GIP, and the planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS, each position BlackRock’s platform ahead of evolving client needs and structural industry trends.\n\n\nBlackRock has built a broad private markets platform with $212 billion of AUM across infrastructure, private credit, real estate, private equity and multi-alternatives. As of December 31, 2024, BlackRock had approximately $45 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of private markets strategies, and remains confident in its ability to accelerate growth as a leader in private markets. BlackRock also manages $76 billion in liquid alternatives, as well as $90 billion in liquid credit strategies, included within fixed income AUM. With the close of the GIP transaction, and the planned acquisition of HPS, BlackRock’s alternatives platform is expected to represent approximately $600 billion in client assets making it a top five alternatives provider.\n\n\nThe private markets – and clients’ allocations to them – are expected to continue to grow. Standardized, transparent private markets data and analytics will be increasingly important. As with Aladdin, BlackRock believes it can add even more value to Preqin as both a user and provider of private markets data and risk analytics. Aladdin expanded into new asset classes and markets as BlackRock and its clients evolved, and it expects the same for Preqin.\n\n\nIn addition to private markets, BlackRock is executing on a strong opportunity set across multiple growth channels. These include ETFs, whole portfolio solutions like outsourced mandates and models, and technology.\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe ETF industry has been growing rapidly, driven by structural tailwinds including the use of ETFs as active tools, the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, growth in model portfolios, expansion of digital wealth platforms, and the modernization of the bond market. BlackRock’s ETF growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including Core, Strategic, which includes Fixed Income, Factors, Sustainable and Thematic ETFs, and Precision Exposures. BlackRock views ETFs as a technology that facilitates investing, and ETFs have become core to asset management. The Company believes that ETFs will continue to be a structural growth area as clients turn to ETFs as the preferred vehicle for investing strategies of all types. BlackRock has been a leader in expanding the market for ETFs by making them more accessible and by delivering new asset classes like bonds or cryptocurrency and investment strategies like active. Approximately a quarter of 2024 ETF net inflows of $390 billion were into products launched in the last five years. Active ETFs delivered $22 billion in net inflows in 2024, while BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) was the largest ETF launch in history, growing to over $50 billion of AUM in less than a year. BlackRock will continue to innovate at the product and portfolio level and accelerate distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated investment solutions.\n\n\nAs the asset management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, BlackRock’s strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions for both retail investors and institutions. This includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and private markets products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. Digital wealth tools are an important component of BlackRock’s retail strategy, as BlackRock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends Aladdin Wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by Aladdin\n.\n BlackRock has also seen strong momentum in outsourcing solutions among institutional clients, including the funding of several significant mandates in 2024, and anticipates continued outsourcing opportunities in the future.\n\n\nBlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. Market volatility, growing cost pressures, and complexity in optimizing whole portfolios underscore the need for enterprise operating and risk management technology, and should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackRock continues to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their specific needs, and BlackRock is providing them with choice and flexibility. Through the integration of Aladdin and eFront, clients are able to better manage and analyze risk across their whole portfolio spanning public and private markets. BlackRock is empowering clients with data and opening Aladdin by creating connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others. This connectivity helps clients work in their Aladdin environments with a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience. Investments in Aladdin AI copilots, enhancements in openness supporting ecosystem partnerships, and advancing whole portfolio solutions including private markets and digital assets are expected to further augment the value of using Aladdin. BlackRock’s planned acquisition of Preqin is expected to expand capabilities beyond private markets investment management and technology to data.\n \n\n\nAcross BlackRock, many clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability factors on their portfolios. This shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainability-related factors can affect economic growth, asset values, and financial markets as a whole. As a fiduciary, BlackRock is committed to providing clients with choice and then executing in accordance with their chosen objectives – for some clients, this includes investing in sustainable strategies. The Company aims to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns within the mandates clients choose, underpinned by research, data, and analytics.\n\n\nBlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, and BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong investment performance, could impact BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings.\n \n\n\nCentral banks globally have taken actions to reduce or maintain interest rates, after a rapid rate hiking regime in 2022 and much of 2023, in an effort to moderate inflation. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Changes in global interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows. BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by governmental changes, as well as potential regulations, foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that may arise as a result of such changes. See Part I, Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n herein for information on the possible future effects of changes in global interest rates and governmental changes on the Company's results.\n\n\nBlackRock manages $2.9 trillion in fixed income assets, nearly two-thirds of which are owned by institutions for strategic or liability-matching purposes. BlackRock believes it is well positioned for a stabilizing rate environment due to the breadth, diversification and investment performance of its fixed income platform which encompasses active, ETFs and non-ETF index fixed income products, and a range of strategies, including unconstrained, high yield, total return and short-duration.\n\n\nBlackRock manages $6.3 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. Beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”) and securities lending revenue.\n\n\nBlackRock believes its strategy aligns with expected future client demand and structural growth opportunities in areas including private markets, such as infrastructure and private credit; ETFs; whole portfolio solutions including outsourcing and models; and integrated public-private markets enterprise technology through Aladdin, eFront and Preqin upon the transaction’s closing.\n \n\n\nBlackRock enters 2025 with strong momentum across its franchise, including its newly enhanced private markets platform. The Company is positioned ahead of market opportunities that it believes will drive outsized growth for BlackRock in the years to come.\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExecutive Summary\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions, except per share data)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAAP basis\n(1)\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20,407\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17,859\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,833\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,584\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,574\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,275\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating margin\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n578\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n706\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,783\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,479\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to BlackRock\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,369\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,502\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted earnings per common share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n42.01\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n36.51\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs adjusted\n(2)\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,110\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,593\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating margin\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n533\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n648\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to BlackRock\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,612\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,692\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted earnings per common share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n43.61\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n37.77\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets under management (end of period)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,551,251\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,008,995\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted weighted-average common shares outstanding\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n151.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n150.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares outstanding (end of period)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n154.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n148.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook value per share\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n306.52\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n264.96\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash dividends declared and paid per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20.40\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20.00\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\n\n\n(2)\nAs adjusted items are described in more detail in \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n. \n\n\n(3)\nTotal BlackRock stockholders’ equity, divided by total shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. \n\n\n2024 \nCompared\n w\nith\n 2023\n\n\nGAAP.\n Operating income of $7.6 billion increased $1.3 billion and operating margin of 37.1% increased 200 bps from 2023. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees, driven by the positive impact of markets on average AUM, organic base fee growth and fees on AUM acquired in the GIP Transaction, as well as higher performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, sales, asset and account expense, and general and administration expense. Expense for 2024 was impacted by the GIP Transaction, including nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangible assets acquired in the GIP Transaction. In addition, expense for 2024 included a $50 million noncash impairment charge related to certain indefinite-lived open-end management contracts. Expense for 2023 included a restructuring charge of $61 million in connection with initiatives to reorganize specific platforms, primarily Aladdin and private markets, to stay ahead of client needs.\n\n\nNonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (\"NCI\") decreased $128 million from 2023, driven primarily by lower mark-to-market revaluation of private equity co-investments and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income, a pre-tax gain of approximately $66 million in connection with a transaction related to a minority investment in EquiLend Holdings, LLC (the \"EquiLend Transaction\"), and higher mark-to-market gains on unhedged seed capital investments and certain minority investments.\n\n\nIncome tax expense for 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure, $63 million related to the realization of capital losses from changes in the Company's organizational tax structure, $37 million related to vested stock-based compensation awards, and a net noncash discrete tax expense of $14 million related to the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities. Income tax expense for 2023 included $242 million discrete tax net benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters and stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2023.\n\n\nEarnings per diluted common share increased $5.50, or 15%, from 2023, primarily reflecting higher operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income.\n \n\n\nAs Adjusted\n.\n Operating income of $8.1 billion increased $1.5 billion and operating margin of 44.5% increased 280 bps from 2023. Earnings per diluted common share increased $5.84, or 15%, from 2023, reflecting higher operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income. The acquisition related expenses and the noncash impairment charge of $50 million described above have been excluded from as adjusted results for 2024. In addition, income tax expense for 2024 excluded the $137 million of benefit and the $14 million net noncash tax expense described above. The pre-tax restructuring charge of $61 million described above has been excluded from as adjusted results for 2023.\n \n\n\nSee \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP.\n\n\nFor further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see \nDiscussion of Financial Results\n herein.\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nBlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n\nComputations and reconciliations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:\n \n\n\n(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income, GAAP basis\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,574\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,275\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP expense adjustments:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash \n    compensation plans (a)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n43\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets (b)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n291\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n151\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition-related compensation costs (b)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n148\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition-related transaction costs (b)\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContingent consideration fair value adjustments (b)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(36\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease costs -

Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.\n\n\n•\nOperating income, as adjusted, includes the following non-GAAP expense adjustments:\n\n\n(a)\nCompensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash compensation plans\n. The Company excludes compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company hedges economically. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the net gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period. Management believes excluding market valuation changes related to the deferred cash compensation plans in the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, provides useful disclosure to both management and investors of the Company’s financial performance over time as these amounts are economically hedged, while also increasing comparability with other companies.\n\n\n(b)\nAcquisition-related costs\n. Acquisition-related costs include adjustments related to amortization and noncash impairment of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including professional services expense and compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies.\n\n\n(c)\nLease costs – New York\n. In 2023, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its current headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York and prior headquarters until the Company's lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. The Company began lease payments related to its current headquarters in May 2023, but began recording lease expense in August 2021 when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Prior to the Company’s move to its current headquarters in February 2023, the impact of lease costs related to 50 Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. In February 2023, the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards and no longer excluded the impact of these lease costs. Subsequently, from February 2023 through April 2023, the Company excluded the impact of lease costs related to the Company's prior headquarters. Management believes excluding the impact of these respective New York lease costs (“Lease costs – New York”) when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented.\n\n\n(d)\nRestructuring charge\n. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a restructuring charge, comprised of severance and compensation expense for accelerated vesting of previously granted deferred compensation awards, in connection with initiatives to reorganize specific platforms, primarily Aladdin and private markets. Management believes excluding the impact of these restructuring charges when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented.\n\n\n(e)\nReduction of indemnification asset.\n In connection with a previous acquisition, BlackRock recorded an $8 million indemnification asset. Due to the resolution of certain tax matters in the third quarter of 2023, BlackRock recorded $8 million of general and administration expense to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $8 million tax benefit. The $8 million general and administrative expense and $8 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there was no impact on BlackRock’s book value. \n\n\n•\nRevenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted:\n Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, excludes the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of certain deferred cash compensation plans. As the gain (loss) on investments and derivatives used to hedge these compensation plans over time substantially offsets the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on these deferred cash compensation plans, which is included in operating income, GAAP basis, management believes excluding the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of the deferred cash compensation plans when calculating nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure for both management and investors of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value.\n\n\n(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:\n Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.\n \n\n\nFor each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters in 2024 include a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization. In addition, amounts for 2024 include a net noncash expense of $14 million associated with the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. This discrete tax expense has been excluded from the as adjusted results as it does not have a cash flow impact as well as to ensure comparability among periods presented.\n\n\nPer share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.\n\n\n(4) Annual Contract Value (\"ACV\"):\n Management believes ACV is an effective metric for reviewing BlackRock’s technology services’ ongoing contribution to its operating results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods while also providing a useful supplemental metric for both management and investors of BlackRock’s growth in technology services revenue over time, as it is linked to the net new business in technology services. ACV represents forward-looking, annualized estimated value of the recurring subscription fees under client contracts, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed, unless we have received a notice of termination, even though such notice may not be effective until a later date. ACV also includes the annualized estimated value of new sales, for existing and new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the recurring fees may not be effective until a later date and excludes nonrecurring fees such as implementation and consulting fees.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAssets Under Management\n\n\nAUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio.

equity, bond and cryptocurrency products, cash management, and significant outsourcing mandates, and AUM added from the GIP Transaction, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.\n \n\n\nNet market appreciation of $993 billion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation.\n\n\nAUM decreased $166 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements,

AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.\n\n\n(4)\nAmounts include commodity ETFs and ETPs.\n\n\nAUM increased $1.4 trillion to $10.0 trillion at December 31, 2023 from $8.6 trillion at December 31, 2022, driven primarily by net market appreciation, net inflows, led by flows into bond and equity ETFs, cash management, significant outsourcing mandates and growth in private markets.\n\n\nNet market appreciation of $1.1 trillion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation.\n\n\nAUM increased $50 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar largely against the British pound and the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscussion of Financial Results\n \n\n\nIntroduction\n \n\n\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.\n \n\n\nThe Company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.\n \n\n\nInvestment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold, and when it is determined that the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the Company’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on private market products and a greater number and size of liquid products with performance measurement periods that end in the third and fourth quarters.\n \n\n\nThe Company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. Clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin\n \nplatform, or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\n\nThe Company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios. The fees are primarily based on AUM and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.\n\n\nThe Company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. Fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed.\n\n\nThe Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.\n \n\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, BlackRock updated the presentation of the Company’s expense line items within the consolidated statements of income by including a new “sales, asset and account expense” income statement caption. Such expense line items have been recast for 2023 to conform to this new presentation. For a recast of 2023 expense line items, see page 12 of Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 12, 2024. Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, sales, asset and account expense, general and administration expense, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets.\n \n\n\n•\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. \n\n\n•\nSales, asset and account expense includes distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, and sub-advisory and other expense. These expenses primarily vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.\n\n\n- Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain Company products.\n \n\n\n- Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party non-advisory expenses incurred by the Company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.\n \n\n\n- Sub-advisory and other expense is primarily related to the contracts where third-party advisors provide investment advisory services on the Company's behalf.\n\n\n•\nGeneral and administration expense includes marketing and promotional (including travel and entertainment expense), occupancy and office-related, portfolio services (including market data costs), technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the net impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. \n\n\nApproximately 80% of the Company’s revenue is generated in US dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the US.\n \n\n\nNonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. The Company primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, private credit, hedge funds and real assets. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment products (“CIPs”). The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to the Company is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income.\n \n\n\nRevenue\n \n\n\nThe table below presents detail of

Securities lending revenue of $615 million decreased $60 million from $675 million in 2023, primarily reflecting lower spreads, partially offset by higher average balances of securities on loan.\n\n\nInvestment advisory performance fees\n of $1.2 billion in 2024 increased $653 million from $554 million in 2023, primarily driven by higher revenue from liquid alternative products, including strong performance from a single hedge fund in 2024, and higher revenue from long-only and private market products.\n\n\nTechnology services revenue\n of $1.6 billion in 2024 increased $118 million from $1.5 billion in 2023, reflecting sustained demand for Aladdin technology offerings and the successful onboarding of a number of new clients.\n\n\nAdvisory and other revenue\n of $224 million in 2024 increased $65 million from $159 million in 2023, reflecting the impact of presenting earnings (losses) from certain equity method minority investments within nonoperating income (expense) beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and higher transition management assignments, partially offset by lower revenue from advisory assignments.\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpense\n \n\n\nThe following table presents expense for 2024 and 2023.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpense:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,546\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,779\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales, asset and account expense\n(1)\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution and servicing costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,171\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,051\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect fund expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,464\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,331\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-advisory and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n140\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n116\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal sales, asset and account expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,775\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,498\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and administration expense:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing and promotional\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n314\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n309\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy and office related\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n421\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n418\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio services\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n262\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n270\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n674\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n607\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional services\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n277\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n195\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign exchange remeasurement\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContingent consideration fair value adjustments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(36\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther general and administration\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n270\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n252\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal general and administration expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,221\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,095\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring charge\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n291\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n151\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expense\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,833\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,584\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, BlackRock updated the presentation of the Company’s expense line items within the consolidated statements of income by including a new “sales, asset and account expense” income statement caption.

For a recast of 2023 expense line items, see page 12 of Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 12, 2024.\n\n\nExpense increased $1.2 billion, or 11%, from 2023, reflecting higher employee compensation and benefits expense, sales, asset and account expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets and general and administration expense. Expense for 2024 was impacted by the previously described expenses incurred in connection with the GIP Transaction and the $50 million noncash impairment charge\n(1)\n. Expense for 2023 included a previously mentioned restructuring charge of $61 million\n(1)\n.\n\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense\n of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased $767 million from $5.8 billion in 2023, reflecting higher incentive compensation, primarily as a result of higher operating income and performance fees. 2024 employee compensation and benefits expense was also impacted by the GIP Transaction, including nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation expense\n(1)\n.\n\n\nSales, asset and account expense\n of $3.8 billion in 2024 increased $277 million from $3.5 billion in 2023, driven by higher distribution and servicing costs and direct fund expense, primarily reflecting higher average AUM.\n\n\nGeneral and administration expense\n of $2.2 billion in 2024 increased $126 million from $2.1 billion in 2023, primarily associated with acquisition-related costs\n(1)\n in connection with the GIP Transaction, including transaction costs recorded in professional services expense, and higher technology expense, partially offset by lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments.\n\n\nRestructuring charge\n(1)\n of $61 million, comprised of severance and compensation expense for accelerated vesting of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in 2023, as previously described.\n \n\n\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\n(1)\n of $291 million in 2024 increased $140 million from $151 million in 2023, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the GIP Transaction and the previously described $50 million noncash impairment charge.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nThese expenses have been excluded from the Company's as adjusted financial results under the expense adjustments for acquisition-related costs and restructuring charge, as applicable.

The significant foreign jurisdictions that have different statutory tax rates than the US federal statutory rate of 21% include the UK, Germany, Canada and Ireland.\n\n\n2024\n \nIncome tax expense (GAAP) reflected:\n\n\n•\na discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure; \n\n\n•\na discrete tax benefit of $63 million related to the realization of capital losses from changes in the Company's organizational tax structure; \n\n\n•\na net discrete tax benefit of $37 million related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2024; and\n\n\n•\na $14 million net noncash tax expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities.\n\n\nThe as adjusted effective tax rate of 23.5% for 2024 excluded the $137 million discrete tax benefit due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization and the $14 million net noncash tax expense, as it does not have a cash flow impact as well as to ensure comparability among periods presented.\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer (“Pillar One”) and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15% (“Pillar Two”). In response, European Union member states and several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have since adopted laws implementing the OECD’s minimum tax rules under Pillar Two, effective starting in 2024. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackRock does business have changed and may continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. The Pillar Two Framework did not have a material impact on BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements for 2024 and the Company is continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods.\n\n\n2023 \nIncome tax expense (GAAP) reflected:\n\n\n•\na discrete tax benefit of $201 million, related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters; and \n\n\n•\na discrete tax benefit of $41 million, related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2023.\n\n\nStatement of financial condition Overview\n\n\nAs Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition\n\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and CIPs.\n\n\nThe Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n \n\n\nSeparate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements\n \n\n\nSeparate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.\n \n\n\nIn addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral.

See Note 25, \nIncome Taxes\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.\n\n\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.\n \n\n\nAssets.\n Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 included $169 million of cash held by CIPs (see \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2024). Accounts receivable at December 31, 2024 increased $388 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher base and performance fee receivables. Investments at December 31, 2024 increased $29 million from December 31, 2023 (for more information see\n Investments\n herein). Goodwill and intangible assets, net at December 31, 2024 increased $12.9 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the GIP Transaction and the SpiderRock Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets and a $50 million noncash impairment charge related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. Other assets at December 31, 2024 decreased $261 million from December 31, 2023, primarily related to a decrease in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by a decrease in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by an increase in certain minority investments.\n\n\nLiabilities.\n Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2024 increased $571 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher 2024 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2024 increased $296 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher interest on borrowings and increased accruals, including accruals related to direct fund expense. Contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2024 increased $4.2 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the contingent consideration liability in connection with the GIP Transaction, which will be settled all in stock, subject to the achievement of specified performance targets (See Note 3, \nAcquisitions\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information). Other liabilities at December 31, 2024 decreased $343 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower unit trust payables (substantially offset by a decrease in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2024 decreased $172 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the intellectual property reorganization and the GIP Transaction.\n\n\nInvestments\n \n\n\nThe Company’s investments were $9.8 billion and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n \n\n\nThe Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the economic portion of investments that is owned by the Company as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred cash compensation investments and hedged exposures, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred cash compensation plans is substantially offset by a change in associated compensation expense, and the impact of the portfolio of seed investments is mitigated by futures entered into as part of the Company's macro hedging strategy. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, GAAP\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,769\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,740\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments held by CIPs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(5,752\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(5,977\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet interest in CIPs\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,877\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,111\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, as adjusted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,894\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,874\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments related to deferred cash compensation plans\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(185\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(264\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHedged exposures\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,757\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,771\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Bank stock\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(93\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(92\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarried interest\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,983\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,975\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal “economic” investment exposure\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,876\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,772\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nAmounts included $1.9 billion of carried interest (VIEs) at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure.\n\n\n(2)\nAmounts do not include investments in corporate minority investments included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\n\nThe following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity/Fixed income/Multi-asset\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,786\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate equity\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,199\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,491\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n629\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n509\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther alternatives\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n780\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n757\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives subtotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,608\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,757\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHedged exposures\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,757\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,771\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal “economic” investment exposure\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,876\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,772\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nAmounts include seed investments in equity, fixed income, and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies.\n\n\n(2)\nOther alternatives primarily include co-investments in credit funds, direct hedge fund strategies, and hedge fund solutions. \n\n\nAs adjusted investment activity for 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, as adjusted, beginning balance\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,874\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,419\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases/capital contributions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,214\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,403\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales/maturities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,888\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(914\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributions\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(466\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(111\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket appreciation(depreciation)/earnings from equity method investments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n220\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n607\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarried interest capital allocations/(distributions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n425\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(68\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, as adjusted, ending balance\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,894\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,874\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nAmount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments. \n\n\n(2)\nAmount includes the impact of foreign exchange movements.\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \n\n\nBlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs\n\n\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs.

BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.\n \n\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIPs:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nGAAP\nBasis\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nImpact on\nCash Flows\nof CIPs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCash Flows\nExcluding\nImpact of\nCIPs\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, December 31, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,433\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n265\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,168\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,165\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,519\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,684\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by/(used in) investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(959\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(26\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(933\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by/(used in) financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,992\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,568\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3,560\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n106\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n106\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,320\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,297\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,753\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n288\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,465\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,956\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,311\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,267\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by/(used in) investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3,004\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(127\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,877\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by/(used in) financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,236\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,319\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(83\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(162\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(162\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(119\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,145\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,779\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n169\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,610\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends and repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.\n \n\n\nFor details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\n\nCash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred cash compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.\n \n\n\nCash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for 2024 were $2.9 billion, primarily reflecting $2.9 billion related to the GIP Transaction, $255 million of purchases of property and equipment, $74 million related to the SpiderRock Transaction, and $52 million of net investment purchases, partially offset by $366 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.\n\n\nCash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for 2024 were $83 million, primarily resulting from $3.1 billion of cash dividend payments, $1.9 billion of share repurchases, including $1.6 billion in open market transactions and $0.3 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $1.0 billion of repayment of long-term borrowings, partially offset by $5.5 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings related to the issuances of senior notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the GIP Transaction and the Preqin Transaction, which is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2025, and $0.5 billion in proceeds from stock options exercised.\n\n\nThe Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.

See \nNet Capital Requirements\n herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.\n\n\nTotal liquidity resources increased $4.5 billion during 2024, primarily reflecting $4.5 billion of net proceeds from long-term borrowings, a $400 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility, and positive cash flows from operating activities, partially offset by cash dividend payments of $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion related to the GIP Transaction, share repurchases of $1.9 billion and $74 million related to the SpiderRock Transaction.\n\n\nA significant portion of the Company’s $7.9 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShare Repurchases.\n During 2024, the Company repurchased 1.9 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2024, there were approximately 3.8 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal limitations, price and market conditions.\n\n\nNet Capital Requirements.\n The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.\n \n\n\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\n\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.\n \n\n\nUndistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries.\n As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, US income taxes were provided on the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings. The financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans.\n\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n \n\n\n2024 Revolving Credit Facility. \nThe Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility, which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2024 Credit Facility”). In March 2024, the 2024 Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, (1) permit the GIP Transaction and the transactions contemplated in connection with the GIP Transaction, (2) add New BlackRock as a borrower under the existing credit agreement, (3) add New BlackRock as a guarantor of the payment and performance of the obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of Old BlackRock and certain of its other subsidiaries and (4) update the sustainability-linked pricing mechanics to remove existing metrics and allow new metrics, if any, to be set following the consummation of the GIP Transaction. In May 2024, the 2024 Credit Facility was further amended to, among other things, (1) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $400 million to $5.4 billion and (2) extend the maturity date to March 2029 for lenders (other than one non-extending lender) pursuant to the Company’s option to request extensions of the maturity date available under the 2024 Credit Facility (with the commitment of the non-extending lender maturing in March 2028). The 2024 Credit Facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2024 Credit Facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $6.4 billion. Interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at an applicable benchmark rate for the denominated currency of the loan, plus a spread. The 2024 Credit Facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility.\n\n\nCommercial Paper Program.\n On November 7, 2024, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the \"CP Program\") under which the Company may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the \"CP Notes\") on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $5 billion. The payments of the CP Notes have been unconditionally guaranteed by Old BlackRock (the \"CP Notes Guarantee\"). The CP Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of BlackRock's other unsubordinated indebtedness, and the obligations of Old BlackRock under the CP Notes Guarantee will rank equal in right of payment with all of Old BlackRock's other unsubordinated indebtedness. Net proceeds of issuances of the CP Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2024 Credit Facility. The CP Program replaced the Company's prior $4 billion commercial paper program, which was terminated concurrently with the establishment of this CP Program, and has been put into place in connection with the Company's organizational structure following the closing of the GIP Transaction. At December 31, 2024, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.\n\n\nSubsidiary Credit Facility.\n In January 2024, BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (\"BIM UK\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Subsidiary Credit Facility”) in the amount of £25 million (or approximately $31 million based on the GBP/USD foreign exchange rate at December 31, 2024) with a rolling 364-day term structure. The Subsidiary Credit Facility is available for BIM UK's general corporate and working capital purposes. At December 31, 2024, there was no amount outstanding under the Subsidiary Credit Facility.\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLong-Term Borrowings\n \n\n\nThe carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2024 included the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\nMaturity Amount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCarrying Value\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMaturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.25% Notes\n(1)(2)\n\n\n$\n\n\n725\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n725\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.20% Notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n700\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n698\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMarch 2027\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.60% Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n800\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n797\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nJuly 2027\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.25% Notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n993\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 2029\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.70% Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n497\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMarch 2029\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.40% Notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n997\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 2030\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.90% Notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n1,250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,243\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nJanuary 2031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.10% Notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n989\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.75% Notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n1,250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,233\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2033\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.00% Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n993\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMarch 2034\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.90% Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n495\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nJanuary 2035\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.25% Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n1,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,468\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMarch 2054\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.35% Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n1,200\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,186\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nJanuary 2055\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal long-term borrowings\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,425\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,314\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe carrying value of the 1.25% Notes is calculated using the EUR/USD\n \nforeign exchange rate as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\n(2)\nIssued by Old BlackRock and guaranteed by New BlackRock.\n\n\nIn March 2024, New BlackRock issued $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $500 million of 4.70% notes maturing on March 14, 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"), $1.0 billion of 5.00% notes maturing on March 14, 2034 (the \"2034 Notes\") and $1.5 billion of 5.25% notes maturing on March 14, 2054 (the \"2054 Notes\") (collectively, the \"March 2024 Notes\"). Net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the GIP Transaction, which closed in October 2024. Interest on the March 2024 Notes of approximately $152 million per year is payable semi-annually on March 14 and September 14 of each year, which commenced on September 14, 2024. The March 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “March 2024 Notes Guarantee”) on a senior unsecured basis by Old BlackRock. The March 2024 Notes and the March 2024 Notes Guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of BlackRock and Old BlackRock's other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. The March 2024 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of BlackRock at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable series of March 2024 Notes.\n \n\n\nIn March 2024, the Company fully repaid $1.0 billion of 3.50% Notes at maturity.\n\n\nIn July 2024, New BlackRock issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $800 million of 4.60% notes maturing on July 26, 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\"), $500 million of 4.90% notes maturing on January 8, 2035 (the \"2035 Notes\") and $1.2 billion of 5.35% notes maturing on January 8, 2055 (the \"2055 Notes\") (collectively, the \"July 2024 Notes\"). Net proceeds are intended to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Preqin Transaction, which is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The July 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “July 2024 Notes Guarantee”, and together with the March 2024 Notes Guarantee \"Notes Guarantees\") on a senior unsecured basis by Old BlackRock. The July 2024 Notes and the July 2024 Notes Guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of BlackRock and Old BlackRock’s other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. Interest on the 2027 Notes of approximately $37 million per year is payable semi-annually on January 26 and July 26 of each year, beginning January 26, 2025. Interest on the 2035 Notes and 2055 Notes of approximately $25 million and $64 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on January 8 and July 8 of each year, beginning January 8, 2025. The July 2024 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of BlackRock at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable series of July 2024 Notes. In addition, if the Preqin Transaction is not consummated, the Company will be required to redeem all outstanding 2027 Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a Special Mandatory Redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption date.\n\n\nFor more information on the Company’s borrowings, see Note 15, \nBorrowings\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\n\n\nOn October 1, 2024, in connection with the closing of the GIP Transaction, BlackRock, Inc. (formerly known as BlackRock Funding, Inc.) (\"New BlackRock\") became the ultimate parent company of BlackRock Finance, Inc. (formerly known as BlackRock, Inc.) (\"Old BlackRock\"), GIP and their respective subsidiaries. See \nOverview\n for additional information.\n\n\nNew BlackRock is the issuer of the previously described March 2024 Notes and July 2024 Notes (collectively the \"2024 Notes\"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Old BlackRock. The 2024 Notes and the Notes Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of New BlackRock's and Old BlackRock's other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. No other subsidiary of Old BlackRock or New BlackRock guarantees the 2024 Notes. The Notes Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, and Old BlackRock will be released from all obligations under the indenture in its capacity as guarantor, in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. See Note 15, \nBorrowings\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the 2024 Notes, Old BlackRock's senior unsecured notes and the New BlackRock Guarantee.\n\n\nOn October 1, 2024, in connection with the closing of the GIP Transaction, New BlackRock also entered into a guarantee (the “New BlackRock Guarantee”) pursuant to which New BlackRock fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, the obligations of Old BlackRock with respect to its previously issued senior unsecured notes. The New BlackRock Guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of New BlackRock's other unsubordinated indebtedness. In certain circumstances as described in the New BlackRock Guarantee, the New BlackRock Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, and New BlackRock will be released from all obligations under the New BlackRock Guarantee.\n \n\n\nThe following presents unaudited summarized financial information of New BlackRock and Old BlackRock (together with the New BlackRock, the \"Obligor Group\") on a combined basis as of December 31, 2024 and for the period from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. Intercompany balances and transactions between New BlackRock and Old BlackRock have been eliminated, and balances and transactions with subsidiaries, which are not part of the Obligor Group, have been separately presented, and investments in and equity in earnings related to subsidiaries of New BlackRock and Old BlackRock, which are not members of the Obligor Group, have been excluded.\n \n\n\nSummarized Balance Sheet (unaudited)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceivables from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,681\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27,273\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n362\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n35,316\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorrowings\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,314\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayables to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,206\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,278\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25,798\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarized Income Statement (unaudited)\n\n\nFor 2024, net loss of the Obligor Group was $767 million and primarily comprised of $87 million amortization expense, a gain of $31 million related to a contingent consideration fair value adjustment, a $35 million impairment charge, $391 million of interest expense, and related taxes. Revenue during this period was not material.\n \n\n\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\n \n\n\nThe Company’s material contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies at December 31, 2024 include borrowings, operating leases, investment commitments, compensation and benefits obligations, purchase obligations, and contingent consideration liabilities.\n\n\nBorrowings\n. At December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $12.4 billion, of which $725 million is payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these borrowings total $6.4 billion, of which $470 million is payable within 12 months. See Note 15, \nBorrowings\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n \n\n\nOperating Leases.\n The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. At December 31, 2024, the Company had operating lease payment obligations of approximately $2.3 billion, of which $198 million is payable within 12 months. See Note 13, \nLeases\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\n\nInvestment Commitments.\n At December 31, 2024, the Company had $1.2 billion of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various private market products, including private equity funds, real assets funds, and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.\n \n\n\nCompensation and Benefit Obligations.\n The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2024 totaled $3.0 billion and included annual incentive compensation of $2.0 billion, deferred compensation of $0.4 billion and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $0.5 billion. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2025, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years.\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPurchase Obligations.\n In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for market data, technology, office-related services, marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately $615 million, of which $260 million is payable within 12 months.\n\n\nContingent Consideration Liabilities\n. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to the achievement of specified performance targets or satisfaction of certain post-closing events. The fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in contingent consideration liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2024 totaled $4.3 billion, including $4.2 billion related to the GIP Transaction, which, if any, will be settled all in stock, for a number of shares ranging from 4.0 million to 5.2 million shares, subject to achieving certain performance targets. See Note 3, \nAcquisitions\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, \nSignificant Accounting Policies\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\n\nConsolidation\n \n\n\nThe Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The Company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert absolute control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as ongoing redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was deemed to be the PB of approximately 110 VIEs. See Note 6, \nConsolidated Sponsored Investment Products\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.\n \n\n\nFair Value Measurements\n \n\n\nThe Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, \nSignificant Accounting Policies\n, and Note 8, \nFair Value Disclosures\n, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements.\n \n\n\nChanges in Valuation.\n Changes in value on $7.1 billion of investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $640 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $2.0 billion relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2024, changes in fair value of $3.8 billion of CIPs will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of CIPs was $2.0 billion.\n\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n \n\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, where the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of the transaction. Any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company determines fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, using the best available information which incorporates various estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows, fundraising assumptions, useful lives, and discount rates. These estimates are based on historical data, internal estimates, and external sources. Unanticipated events may affect the validity of these assumptions.\n \n\n\nDuring 2024, BlackRock recorded approximately $2.7 billion of finite-lived management contracts and investor relationships in connection with the GIP Transaction. The acquisition date fair values were determined using an income approach, which applied certain significant assumptions, which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These assumptions primarily included discounts rates ranging from 7%-11%, as well as estimated revenue projections based on AUM, AUM growth rates, revenue basis points, operating margins, and tax rates. While the Company believes these assumptions to be reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts.\n\n\nGoodwill.\n The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering qualitative factors such as entity-specific and macroeconomic factors as potential impairment indicators as well as quantitative factors such as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2024 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor various impairment indicators as well as its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $25.9 billion of goodwill, including $10.3 billion in connection with the GIP Transaction and the Company’s common stock closed at $1,025, which exceeded its book value of $307 per share.\n \n\n\nIndefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles.\n Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds, collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (1) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (2) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (3) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (4) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (5) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.\n \n\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets represent finite-lived investor/customer relationships, technology related assets, and management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company for a specified period of time. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2024 ranged from approximately 1 to 14 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of approximately 9 years.\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired at least annually, as of July 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible assets might be impaired.\n \n\n\nIn evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock performs certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant quantitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other qualitative factors including: (1) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (2) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (3) Company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset, which is generally determined using an income approach, is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.\n\n\nFor finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Factors included in evaluating finite-lived customer relationships, technology related assets and trade names include technology services revenue trends, customer attrition rates, obsolescence rates, and royalty rates. For finite-lived management contracts, evaluation is based on changes in assumptions including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current estimated fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.\n \n\n\nIn addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $241 million, $151 million and $151 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \n\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company performed its annual impairment assessment, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. In 2024, based on this assessment, the Company determined that the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to certain acquired open-end management contracts were impaired, and as a result, recorded a noncash impairment charge of $50 million, included within amortization and impairment of intangible assets expense on the consolidated statements of income. The impairment was primarily the result of a decrease in certain quantitative factors, including reduced growth expectation, lower revenue basis points and net client outflows, which caused the fair value to decline below its carrying value. While the Company believes all assumptions utilized in the analysis are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts, which could drive additional impairment in future periods. In addition, the Company determined, that no impairment charges were required for any other intangible assets, and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. In 2023 and 2022, the Company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.\n \n\n\nContingent Consideration Liabilities\n\n\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to the achievement of specified performance targets or satisfaction of certain post-closing events. The fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in contingent consideration liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2024 totaled $4.3 billion, including $4.2 billion related to the GIP Transaction, which, if any, will be settled all in stock, ranging from 4.0 million to 5.2 million shares, subject to achieving certain performance targets. The fair value of the GIP Transaction contingent consideration was estimated using the income approach, which included certain significant inputs such as a risk-free discount rate of approximately 4.3% as well as current estimates of the timing and amounts of fundraising forecasts, stock and AUM volatility, and correlation between stock price and AUM (Level 3 inputs). As the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration subsequently changes, contingent consideration liabilities are adjusted, resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income until the contingency is resolved. Accordingly, changes in the key inputs and assumptions described can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in a reporting period.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n \n\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Management judgment is required in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in identification of distinct services.\n\n\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. AUM represents the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values).\n\n\nThe Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts (\"SMAs\"). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPerformance fees, including carried interest, are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such performance fees are recognized when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal. Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds, and determine the timing of such distributions.\n \n\n\nThe Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition.\n \n\n\nThe Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees and other third parties, which may be subject to clawback. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 17, \nRevenue\n, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2024 and 2023.\n\n\nThe Company earns revenue for providing technology services. Determining the amount of revenue to recognize requires judgment and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement, are distinct performance obligations, and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\n\nAdjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM, recognized when known, and given the Company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal. See Note 2, \nSignificant Accounting Policies\n, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on revenue recognition, including other revenue streams.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nThe Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit.\n \n\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n \n\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2024, BlackRock had $517 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $431 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\n \n\n\nManagement is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2024, the Company had deferred income tax assets of $181 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $3.3 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company.\n \n\n\nThe Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\n\n\nAccounting Developments\n\n\nFor accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during 2024 and for accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company, see Note 2, \nSignificant Accounting Policies\n, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\n\n63",
