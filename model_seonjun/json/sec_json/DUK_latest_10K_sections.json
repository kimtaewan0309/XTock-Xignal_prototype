BUSINESS\nDUKE ENERGY\nGeneral\nDuke Energy was incorporated on May 3, 2005, and is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also Subsidiary Registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. Operations in Kentucky are conducted through Duke Energy Ohio's wholly owned subsidiary, Duke Energy Kentucky. References herein to Duke Energy Ohio include Duke Energy Ohio and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted. When discussing Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to such reports.\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energy’s website at duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nBusiness Segments\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes two reportable business segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&I). The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. Commercial Renewables is reported as discontinued operations and is no longer a reportable segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Dispositions,\" for further details. Duke Energy's chief operating decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments.” The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy’s business segments, as well as Other.\nELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nEU&I conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. EU&I provides retail electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 8.6 million customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The service territory is approximately 90,000 square miles across six states with a total estimated population of 27 million. The operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. \nDuring 2021, Duke Energy executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of GIC in Duke Energy Indiana in exchange for a 19.9% minority interest issued by Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction was completed following two closings. Additionally, in November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay, which was moved to EU&I. Duke Energy entered into purchase and sale agreements with affiliates of Brookfield for the sale of the utility-scale solar and wind group in June 2023 and with affiliates of ArcLight for the distributed generation group in July 2023. Both transactions closed in October 2023 and \nthe sale of the remaining assets was concluded in January 2025\n. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Dispositions,\" for additional information. \nDuke Energy owns a 50% interest in DATC. DATC owns 100% interest in DATC Path 15 Transmission LLC, which owns transmission rights in North America. In January 2025, Duke Energy entered into an agreement to sell its indirect 50% ownership interest in DATC Path 15 Transmission LLC. In November 2024, Duke Energy sold its 50% ownership interest in Pioneer. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates” for further information.\nThe following map shows the service territory for EU&I as of December 31, 2024.\n9\nBUSINESS\nThe electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the NRC, the NCUC, the PSCSC, the FPSC, the IURC, the PUCO and the KPSC.\nThe following table represents the distribution of GWh billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDuke\nDuke\nDuke\nDuke\nDuke\nEnergy\nEnergy\nEnergy\nEnergy\nEnergy\nCarolinas\nProgress\nFlorida\nOhio\nIndiana\nResidential\n33\n \n%\n27\n \n%\n50\n \n%\n37\n \n%\n29\n \n%\nCommercial\n33\n \n%\n22\n \n%\n36\n \n%\n39\n \n%\n26\n \n%\nIndustrial\n22\n \n%\n14\n \n%\n7\n \n%\n22\n \n%\n30\n \n%\nTotal retail sales\n88\n \n%\n63\n \n%\n93\n \n%\n98\n \n%\n85\n \n%\nWholesale and other sales\n12\n \n%\n37\n \n%\n7\n \n%\n2\n \n%\n15\n \n%\nTotal sales\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nThe number of retail customers within the EU&I service territory is expected to increase over time. Weather-normal sales volumes have shown growth in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to strong residential customer growth and strength in the commercial sector including data center usage. Industrial sales remained soft due to overall weakness across the class, including some manufacturing plant closings in certain jurisdictions, impacts of continued high interest rates, and difficulty hiring qualified labor. The impact on customers' usage of electricity from these factors and other potential economic dynamics continues to be monitored. Over a longer time frame, it is expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. Commercial and industrial sales volumes are expected to grow over this longer time frame as sales benefit from a robust economic development portfolio.\nSeasonality and the Impact of Weather\nRevenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and commercial customers are typically more impacted by weather than industrial customers, although decoupling mechanisms in certain jurisdictions may mitigate some of the weather impacts. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions.\n10\nBUSINESS\nThe estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers’ historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods. Estimates of weather impacts may be more difficult to determine during periods of extreme or more volatile weather. An unusually active hurricane season that impacted the Florida and Carolinas territories was also considered when quantifying the impacts of weather for 2024. Declines in usage caused by outage durations related to hurricanes Helene and Milton were estimated and included as an impact due to weather.\nHeating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day.\nCompetition\nRetail\nEU&I’s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. EU&I owns and operates facilities necessary to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electricity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices. \nIn Ohio, EU&I conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. EU&I earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity, but not on the cost of the underlying energy.\nCompetition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such as private solar, at residential, commercial and/or industrial customer sites.\nWholesale\nDuke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The principal factors in competing for these sales are availability of capacity and power, reliability of service and price. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs.\nIncreased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect EU&I’s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of EU&I to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.\nEnergy Capacity and Resources\nEU&I owns approximately 55,139 MW of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.”\nEnergy and capacity to serve customers are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause EU&I to purchase power for its customers may include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. EU&I has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply.\nEU&I’s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.\nSources of Electricity\nEU&I relies principally on natural gas, nuclear fuel and coal for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2024.\nCost of Delivered Fuel per Net\nGeneration by Source\nKilowatt-hour Generated (Cents)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNatural gas and fuel oil\n(a)\n34.7\n \n%\n33.3 \n%\n34.2 \n%\n3.39\n \n3.81 \n6.35 \nNuclear\n(a)\n27.5\n \n%\n28.4 \n%\n26.6 \n%\n0.58\n \n0.58 \n0.58 \nCoal\n(a)\n14.1\n \n%\n12.8 \n%\n13.5 \n%\n4.09\n \n4.07 \n3.43 \nAll fuels (cost based on weighted average)\n(a)\n76.3\n \n%\n74.5 \n%\n74.3 \n%\n2.51\n \n2.63 \n3.75 \nHydroelectric and solar\n(b)\n1.9\n \n%\n1.8 \n%\n1.5 \n%\nTotal generation\n78.2\n \n%\n76.3 \n%\n75.8 \n%\nPurchased power and net interchange\n21.8\n \n%\n23.7 \n%\n24.2 \n%\nTotal sources of energy\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n(a)    Statistics related to all fuels reflect EU&I's public utility ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities. \n(b)    Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped-storage facilities during off-peak periods. \n11\nBUSINESS\nNatural Gas and Fuel Oil\nNatural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for EU&I’s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. EU&I believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future.\nEU&I has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of EU&I’s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. Duke Energy Florida has agreed to not enter any new financial natural gas hedging contracts through December 2027.\nEU&I has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements. EU&I may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements. The EU&I natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines.\nNuclear\nThe industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies.\nEU&I has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. EU&I staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, EU&I generally source these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts.\nEU&I has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100% of its uranium concentrates through at least 2029, 100% of its conversion services through at least 2034, 100% of its enrichment services through at least 2033, and 100% of its fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, EU&I believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services.\nCoal\nEU&I meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. EU&I uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which may have various price adjustment provisions and market reopeners, range from 2025 to 2029 for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, 2025 to 2028 for Duke Energy Florida, 2025 to 2027 for Duke Energy Ohio and 2025 to 2030 for Duke Energy Indiana. EU&I expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. EU&I has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its risk management guidelines regarding projected future consumption. Coal inventory levels may fluctuate as a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the generation fleet. EU&I continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts.\nCoal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Kentucky is primarily produced from mines along the Ohio River in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. There are adequate domestic coal reserves to serve EU&I's coal generation needs through end of life. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by EU&I is between 0.5% and 3.5% for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, between 1.0% and 3.5% for Duke Energy Florida, between 1.5% and 4.0% for Duke Energy Ohio and between 1.0% and 4.0% for Duke Energy Indiana. EU&I's environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO\n2\n) emission allowances, enable EU&I to satisfy current SO\n2\n emission limitations for its existing facilities.\nPurchased Power\nEU&I acquires a portion of its capacity and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase capacity contracts. EU&I believes it can obtain adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected.\nThe following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPurchase obligations and leases (in millions of MWh)\n(a)\n32.1\n \n37.6 \n41.2 \nPurchase capacity under contract (in MW)\n(b)\n3,202\n \n3,997 \n4,028 \n(a)    Represents approximately 12% of total system requirements for 2024, 15% for 2023 and 16% for 2022.\n(b)    These agreements include approximately 182 MW of firm capacity for 2024, and 412 MW of firm capacity for 2023 and 2022 under contract by Duke Energy Florida with QFs.\n12\nBUSINESS\nInventory\nEU&I must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2024, the inventory balance for EU&I was approximately $4.4 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nAsh Basin Management\nThe EPA has issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants, including the 2015 and 2024 CCR Rules. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establish requirements regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirements for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act). \nEU&I has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans must be approved and all associated permits issued before any work can begin. At all sites requiring CCR closure and groundwater remediation, closure methods and groundwater corrective action remedies have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs.\nThe 2015 and 2024 EPA CCR Rules and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress’ wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, \"Other Matters\" and Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively. \nNuclear Matters\nDuke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $16.2 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies.”\nDuke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC and the PSCSC require Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to update cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years. The nuclear decommissioning liabilities are assessed and updated based on changes in cash flows provided in new studies as well as annual assessments to evaluate whether any indicators suggest a change in the estimate of the ARO is necessary.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2023 or 2024 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\nNDTF\nDecommissioning\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCosts\nYear of Cost Study\nDuke Energy\n$\n11,435\n \n$\n10,143 \n$\n9,031\n \n2023 or 2024\nDuke Energy Carolinas\n(a)\n6,468\n \n5,686 \n4,439\n \n2023\nProgress Energy\n4,967\n \n4,457 \n4,592\n \n2024\nDuke Energy Progress\n(b)\n4,636\n \n4,075 \n4,477\n \n2024\nDuke Energy Florida\n(c)\n331\n \n382 \n115\n \nN/A\n(a)    Decommissioning costs for Duke Energy Carolinas reflects its ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors. Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study and a funding study were filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2024.\n(b)    Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in February 2025. An updated funding study will be completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2025.\n(c)    During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. Duke Energy Florida provides the FPSC periodic reports on the status and progress of decommissioning activities.\nThe NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed EU&I to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. EU&I believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations.”\n13\nBUSINESS\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so EU&I will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor sites.\nUnder federal law, the DOE is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel. \nUntil the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. With certain modifications and approvals by the NRC to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for Brunswick, Catawba, McGuire, Oconee and Robinson. Crystal River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation.\nThe nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction. \nEU&I is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current year of expiration of nuclear operating licenses for nuclear stations in operation. In June 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal application for Oconee with the NRC to renew Oconee's operating license for an additional 20 years. Duke Energy has announced its intention to seek 20-year operating license renewals for each of the reactors it operates in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.\nUnit\nYear of Expiration\nDuke Energy Carolinas\nCatawba Units 1 and 2\n2043\nMcGuire Unit 1\n2041\nMcGuire Unit 2\n2043\nOconee Units 1 and 2\n2033\nOconee Unit 3\n2034\nDuke Energy Progress\nBrunswick Unit 1\n2036\nBrunswick Unit 2\n2034\nHarris\n2046\nRobinson\n2030\nThe NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For additional information on nuclear decommissioning activity, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nRegulation\nState\nThe state utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail electric service within their respective states. The state utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of EU&I’s generating facilities. CPCNs issued by the state utility commissions, as applicable, authorize EU&I to construct and operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for the entities within EU&I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent. \nFuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by EU&I. EU&I uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of EU&I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of EU&I.\n14\nBUSINESS\nThe table below reflects significant electric rate case applications approved and effective in the past three years and applications currently pending approval.\nRegulatory\nBody\nRevenue\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n(in millions)\nReturn\non\nEquity\nEquity\nComponent of\nCapital Structure\nEffective\nDate\nApproved Rate Cases:\nDuke Energy Indiana 2024 Rate Case\nIURC\n$\n385 \n9.75 \n%\n53 \n%\nMarch 2025\nDuke Energy Florida 2024 Rate Case\n(a)\nFPSC\n203 \n10.3 \n%\n53 \n%\nJanuary 2025\nDuke Energy Carolinas 2024 South Carolina Rate Case\nPSCSC\n150 \n9.94 \n%\n51.21 \n%\nAugust 2024\nDuke Energy Carolinas 2023 North Carolina Rate Case\n(b)\nNCUC\n768 \n10.1 \n%\n53 \n%\nJanuary 2024\nDuke Energy Kentucky 2022 Kentucky Electric Rate Case\n(c)\nKPSC\n48 \n9.75 \n%\n52.145 \n%\nOctober 2023\nDuke Energy Progress 2022 North Carolina Rate Case\n(d)\nNCUC\n494 \n9.8 \n%\n53 \n%\nOctober 2023\nDuke Energy Progress 2022 South Carolina Rate Case\nPSCSC\n36 \n9.6 \n%\n52.43 \n%\nApril 2023\nDuke Energy Ohio 2021 Ohio Electric Rate Case\nPUCO\n23 \n9.5 \n%\n50.5 \n%\nJanuary 2023\nDuke Energy Florida 2021 Settlement agreement\n(e)\nFPSC\n195 \n9.85 \n%\n53 \n%\nJanuary 2022\nPending Rate Cases:\nDuke Energy Kentucky 2024 Kentucky Electric Rate Case\nKPSC\n70 \n10.85 \n%\n52.728 \n%\nJuly 2025\n(a)    In Year 2, rates will increase by $59 million.

Regulations of FERC and the state utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with EU&I.\nRTOs\nPJM and MISO are the ISOs and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems through central dispatch.\nDuke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a regionwide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.\nEnvironmental\nEU&I is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see “Environmental Matters” in this section. See the “Other Matters” section of Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy’s operations.\nGAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE \nGU&I conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. The natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, TPUC, PHMSA and the FERC. GU&I serves residential, commercial, industrial and power generation natural gas customers, including customers served by municipalities who are wholesale customers. GU&I has over 1.7 million total customers, including approximately 1.2 million customers located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional 560,000 customers located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of Nashville. The following map shows the service territory for GU&I as of December 31, 2024.\n15\nBUSINESS\nThe number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the GU&I service territory is expected to increase over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. \nGU&I also has investments in various pipeline transmission projects, renewable natural gas projects and natural gas storage facilities. \nNatural Gas for Retail Distribution\nGU&I is responsible for the distribution of natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. GU&I’s natural gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This strategy allows GU&I to assure reliable natural gas supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily not needed due to market demand fluctuations, GU&I may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions and/or make wholesale secondary market sales. In 2024, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided for approximately 100% of the natural gas supply for both Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio during the winter months and 100% of forecasted demand was under contract prior to the winter heating season.\nImpact of Weather\nGU&I revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium commercial customers. Margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation.\nCompetition\nGU&I’s businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. GU&I owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. GU&I earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices. \n16\nBUSINESS\nIn residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. GU&I's primary product competition is with electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs. \nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode GU&I's competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair GU&I's ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass GU&I's systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth for GU&I and could cause customers to reduce or cease using natural gas, thereby reducing GU&I's ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow its business, adversely affecting its earnings. \nNatural Gas Investments\nDuke Energy, through its GU&I segment, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline, which is regulated by FERC and traverses Alabama, Georgia, and Florida to transport natural gas to Florida. Duke Energy, also through its GU&I segment, has a 47% equity ownership interest in ACP and investments in various renewable natural gas joint ventures. Duke Energy determined that it would no longer invest in ACP, and the construction of the ACP pipeline, in 2020.\nGU&I has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45% equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC.\nGU&I sold all of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC in February 2023 for approximately book value.\nSee Notes 4, 13 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's and GU&I's natural gas investments. \nInventory\nGU&I must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2024, the inventory balance for GU&I was $95 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulation\nState\nThe state utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. The state utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of GU&I’s natural gas distribution facilities. CPCNs issued by the state utility commissions or other government agencies, as applicable, authorize GU&I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for GU&I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, each of the state utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent. \nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by GU&I. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of GU&I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of GU&I. GU&I also has various regulatory mechanisms in place to track and recover certain costs associated with capital investments including the IMR in North Carolina, ARM in Tennessee, and CEP Rider in Ohio. \n17\nBUSINESS\nThe following table summarizes certain components underlying significant recently approved and effective base rates in the last three years.\nRegulatory\nBody\nRevenue\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n(in millions)\nReturn\non\nEquity\nEquity\nComponent of\nCapital Structure\nEffective Date\nApproved Rate Cases:\nPiedmont 2024 North Carolina Rate Case\n(a)\nNCUC\n$\n88 \n9.8 \n%\n52.30 \n%\nNovember 2024\nDuke Energy Ohio 2022 Natural Gas Base Rate Case\nPUCO\n32 \n9.6 \n%\n52.32 \n%\nNovember 2023\nDuke Energy Kentucky 2021 Natural Gas Base Rate Case\n(b)\nKPSC\n9 \n9.375 \n%\n51.344 \n%\nJanuary 2022\n(a)    Year 2 and thereafter will include an additional $10 million in revenues. \n(b)    An ROE of 9.3% for natural gas riders was approved.\nFor more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”\nFederal\nGU&I is subject to various federal regulations, including regulations that are particular to the natural gas industry.

When discussing Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nExecutive Overview\nThis is a dynamic and exciting time for our industry and our company in particular as we move further into the energy transition. While 2024 presented unprecedented challenges as it relates to a historic storm season, we are now in the early stages of the approval and planned construction of significant new generation investments and anticipate growing energy demands in the coming decades from continued migration into our attractive service territories, onshoring of domestic industries, electrification, and data centers and other investments from the expected artificial intelligence revolution. At Duke Energy, we remain focused on continuing to advance our energy transition, maintaining reliability and affordability for our customers while providing cleaner energy and delivering on our commitments to our communities, employees, investors, and other stakeholders. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, allowing us to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low-risk, predictable and transparent way. \nIn 2024, we responded to the most significant hurricane season in our company's history. While several historic, back-to-back hurricanes challenged our operations and required incremental financing costs, we met our near-term financial commitments and continued to make progress, generating positive regulatory and strategic outcomes, advancing key actions related to our energy transition and continuing to provide the safe and reliable service that our communities depend on. We continue to rebuild the most heavily damaged infrastructure impacted by storms in our service territories, engage with our customers and make critical investments to support our ongoing energy transition and a business portfolio that delivers a reliable and growing dividend, with 2024 representing the 98th consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock. \n39\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\nFinancial Results\n(a)\nSee Results of Operations below for Duke Energy’s definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income available to Duke Energy and net income available to Duke Energy per basic share.\nDuke Energy's 2024 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) increased primarily due to higher impairments on the sale of the Commercial Renewables business in the prior year. Additional drivers primarily include growth from rate increases and riders, improved weather and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher interest expense, depreciation on a growing asset base and storm costs, along with a higher effective tax rate. See “Results of Operations” below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy’s reportable business segments, as well as Other.\n2024 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\nHurricane Response and Operational Excellence\n.\n The reliable and safe operation of our power generating facilities, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities continues to be foundational to serving our customers, our financial results, and our credibility with stakeholders. Our workforce and contract partners work hard to prepare for storm season, through drills, material planning, call center readiness, contingency planning and customer communications. Additionally, operational excellence is especially critical to successfully navigate effective storm response and to efficiently provide the continuity of service our customers demand, regardless of weather or circumstance.\nIn 2024, with three consecutive major hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton, this preparation was critical as we responded to several unprecedented and catastrophic weather events across our service territories. The historic nature of these storms required a new level of coordination and teamwork across every organization at our company. In August 2024, Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 storm, impacting the Duke Energy Florida territory as well as the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress territories in North Carolina and South Carolina and causing approximately 700,000 customer outages. In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm and subsequently impacted all of Duke Energy's service territories as the storm moved inland, with the most severe damage occurring in Florida and the Carolinas. Approximately 3.5 million customers were impacted by Hurricane Helene across Duke Energy's system, the largest number of companywide outages from a single event on our system ever reported. Then, in October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm, causing severe damage across our Florida service territory as a result of high winds, rain and flooding and resulting in more than 1 million customer outages.\nIn such extreme circumstances, our immediate priority is, and always will be, executing the extensive storm preparation and response work to ensure the safe, timely, and efficient restoration of service to impacted customers as quickly as possible. Around-the-clock power restoration efforts continued following the historic damage inflicted by these storms with lineworkers, tree trimmers and removal experts, state department of transportation workers and countless others, working to repair and, in certain areas, completely rebuild, the critical electricity infrastructure that powers and supports the communities we serve. Our operations teams worked diligently, restoring power to approximately 5.5 million customers. We've also seen the benefits of ongoing grid hardening investments, leveraging self-healing technologies and remote restoration capabilities to automate the rerouting of power, more effectively deploy resources, and reduce the frequency or duration of outages for many of our customers during severe weather events.\nPreparation, sound execution, and a comprehensive communication strategy helped us respond quickly and build stakeholder loyalty and support as we continue the important work of rebuilding our communities, including power infrastructure in the hardest-hit areas of our service territories. While these historic storms created incremental financing needs, we are working with our state commissions to appropriately track and recover storm costs under approved regulatory frameworks on a timely basis. We also remain focused on balancing the bill impacts on our customers, including seeking insurance recovery and the securitization of related costs in certain jurisdictions, as appropriate. For more information, see \"Matters Impacting Future Results,\" \"Liquidity and Capital Resources,\" and Notes 4 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Debt and Credit Facilities.\"\n40\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\nDespite the extreme weather and operational challenges with storm response, our generation fleet and nuclear sites delivered strong performance throughout the year and our electric distribution system performed well. In addition to unprecedented storm response, most of our service territories experienced above-average temperatures this summer, including the warmest July on record in Florida, new energy peaks in the Carolinas and weather alerts from PJM and MISO in the Midwest. In January 2025, due to 65 hours of freezing or below freezing temperatures, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress achieved a new record combined peak usage. We prepared for the arrival of extreme weather and delivered on our customer commitments, identifying potential risks, effectively maintaining adequate short-term planning reserves, leveraging outage scheduling optimization, and controlling planned and emergent equipment issues. Effective operations and flexibility by our generation and transmission teams managed these tight margins in an efficient manner and ensured the integrity of the grid our customers rely upon. We will continue to practice our forecasting, grid assessment, oversight, and governance processes as extreme weather challenges operations from time to time, evaluate lessons learned and enhance our strategy and communications to effectively serve our customers now and in the future. Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2024 storm response efforts while making ongoing investments to enhance the reliability and physical security of the grid is a testament to our team’s extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Duke Energy has received 20 Emergency Response Awards since EEI began recognizing storm response in 1998 (including 11 for assisting other utilities).\nThe safety and health of our workforce is a core value and we remain an industry leader in personal safety as measured by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Total Incident Case Rate (TICR). We closely tracked 2023's record-setting safety results with our 2024 TICR coming in below target and anticipate ranking first among North American combined gas and electric companies in an annual industry safety survey for the 10th consecutive year. We expect our gas operations organization to finish in the top 10% according to a gas industry survey for the fourth year in a row. Following on our historic success from 2023, we finished 2024 with less than 100 OSHA recordable injuries. In addition, we  achieved significant year-over-year improvement in environmental performance as measured by internal metrics and had no significant environmental events.\nConstructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes\n. Modernized regulatory constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. One of our long-term strategic goals was to achieve modernized regulatory constructs across all of our jurisdictions. With PBR and MYRP in North Carolina, MYRP in Florida, and grid investment riders in the Midwest, 2024 marked a significant milestone for utilizing these structures across most of our service territories. \nOverall, 2024 was a very active year as it relates to regulatory filings, which reflects the important investments and ongoing energy transition across all of our service territories. We continued to move a variety of regulatory initiatives forward this year, including the following:\n•\nIn January 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a South Carolina rate case. In May 2024, we reached a constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties and in July 2024, the PSCSC issued an order approving the settlement and revising recovery of certain environmental compliance costs. New rates were effective August 1, 2024.\n•\nIn April 2024, we filed formal requests for new base rates across several jurisdictions including Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont.\n◦\nDuke Energy Florida filed a three-year rate plan to begin in January 2025. In August 2024, the FPSC approved our constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties and new rates were effective January 1, 2025.\n◦\nDuke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC and received a constructive order in January 2025. New rates are expected to be effective by March 2025.\n◦\nPiedmont filed a general rate case with the NCUC and reached a constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties in September 2025. Revised interim rates were effective November 1, 2024, subject to refund and pending NCUC approval of the settlement and a final order, which was received in January 2025.\n•\nAlso, in April 2024, Duke Energy Progress issued $177 million of storm recovery bonds, our first issuance under South Carolina's 2022 securitization legislation, which provided the necessary framework for us to lower the bill impacts on our customers related to critical storm restoration activities. In December 2024, we initiated securitization filings in North Carolina related to the unprecedented back-to-back hurricanes of 2024 and are also pursuing timely recovery of storm costs under existing regulatory mechanisms in Florida.\n•\nIn December 2024, Duke Energy Kentucky filed an electric base rate case and new rates are anticipated to go into effect in July 2025.\nIn 2024, w\ne also began to sell nuclear PTCs as allowed under the Inflation Reduction Act. These proceeds are expected to have significant benefits to customers and lower the cost of the energy transition as the sales proceeds, net of associated costs, are flowed back to customers through lower rates under regulatory mechanisms in applicable jurisdictions.\nEnergy Transition\n. Faced with anticipated long-term growth not seen for decades, our industry continues to experience an unprecedented level of change and 2024 was a dynamic year for our company as we navigated storm response and continued to execute on our strategic priorities.\nGenerating Reliable, Affordable and Cleaner Energy\nWe continue to balance reliability and affordability in light of expected increases in long-term demand for electricity in our service territories in the coming decades. While we continue to target a transition out of coal by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals, our focus remains on meeting the growing and evolving energy needs of our customers through a long-range, enterprise strategy that involves modernizing our assets with reliability and affordability top of mind. Although our path will not be linear as we retire coal and bring new generation resources online, we have made strong progress to date in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation (a 44% reduction from 2005) and have established goals to do more (50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040, and net zero by 2050). We are also working to reduce Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from upstream purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream customer use of natural gas, by 50% by 2035, on the way to net zero by 2050.\n41\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\nOver the next decade, we expect to deploy between approximately $190 billion and $200 billion of capital into our regulated businesses, driven by energy transition investments designed to ensure reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy while meeting expected growth in energy demand in the coming decades. These investments will maintain reliability and affordability, drive economic benefits for the communities we serve, deliver cleaner energy and reduce our customers' exposure to fuel volatility. We have filed and refined comprehensive IRPs consistent with this strategy in multiple jurisdictions, allowing us to make needed investments to increase grid resiliency and enable coal plant retirements, renewables and energy storage. \nAs we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will actively work to advocate for research and development and deployment of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. This includes longer-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\nCarolinas Resource Plan\nOur energy transition strategy continues to focus on delivering a path to cleaner energy in a manner that protects grid reliability and affordability, all while meeting the energy demands of the growing and economically vibrant communities that we serve. In January 2024, we filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC related to our combined systemwide Carolinas Resource Plan filed in 2023. These updates were necessary due to substantially increased load forecasts resulting from continued economic development successes in the Carolinas occurring since the systemwide integrated resource plan was prepared. In March 2024, we filed CPCNs for new natural gas generation facilities in North Carolina and made a similar filing in South Carolina for a new solar facility. In 2024, these generation facility filings were approved along with receiving broader approval and direction on the Carolinas Resource Plan from both the NCUC and PSCSC.\nModernizing the Power Grid and Natural Gas Infrastructure\nWe are leveraging new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape and our grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding, helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for our customers. We continue to enhance our customers' experience with the Self-Optimizing Grid (SOG), our flagship grid improvement program spanning all of Duke Energy’s regulated utilities. In 2024, our SOG investments helped to avoid approximately 925,000 customer interruptions across our six-state electric service area, preventing customers from having more than 8.6 million hours of lost outage time during major events. \nInvestments in integrity management of our natural gas infrastructure continue to be of importance to ensure reliable, safe, and increasingly clean delivery of natural gas to our customers. In our LDC business, we remain focused on reducing methane emissions, leveraging our partnerships, emissions platform, sensors and other technologies to find and fix leaks in near real time. We also use cross compression to avoid releasing natural gas into the atmosphere during certain operational activities. \nMacroeconomic Environment\n. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of executing on our business plans while driving efficiencies and productivity in the business. Despite higher interest rates and navigating the operational and financial impacts of unprecedented hurricanes across our service territories, we achieved financial results within our adjusted EPS guidance and continued our cost-management journey with a focus on driving productivity, increasing flexibility and prioritizing spend based on risk and strategic value to our customers and investors. We've built a culture of continuous improvement and continue to identify ways to reduce operating costs, remaining focused on organization simplification, automation, outsourcing and continued operational excellence. \nVolatile commodity prices led to rapid fuel cost increases in 2022, impacting the price of electricity in all of our jurisdictions. We actively worked to manage and maintain prices at lower levels than they otherwise would have been in light of increased commodity prices, working with our regulators to extend recovery periods in certain jurisdictions in a way that was manageable for our customers. We've experienced increased stability in these markets and have now fully recovered these deferred fuel costs, with remaining balances back in line with our historical average as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, while interest rates and inflation have moderated to a degree, we continued to successfully navigate supply chain challenges for major equipment components for new generation and the grid. For solar panels, we've executed longer supply agreements and we continue to proactively secure equipment in advance of hurricane season. Our procurement teams also continue to execute on action plans to enhance planning, augment supply, amend operations and leverage our scale to continue to mitigate these risks to the extent possible.\nRecent macroeconomic headwinds aside, the level of economic development success and growth experienced in our service territories is significantly above what we have experienced over the last two decades. We successfully worked with our state partners to win 78 economic development projects in 2024 alone, representing approximately $26 billion in new capital investment and over 16,000 new jobs within our service territories. These projects include transformational life sciences, automotive, and semiconductors facilities as well as data centers. Supporting the increasing generation load demands expected from projects like these in the coming years is an immense opportunity for our Company and the communities we proudly serve.\nCustomer Satisfaction\n.\n Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are most important to the customer experience. While customer satisfaction across our industry continues to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment and the impacts of inflationary pressures including higher fuel prices and interest rates on customer bills, our work continues to be recognized by our customers, with strong customer satisfaction scores in our jurisdictions including Piedmont, which was ranked No. 1 in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for residential natural gas service in the south for the third year in a row. \n42\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\nDuke Energy Objectives – 2025 and Beyond\nAt Duke Energy, our business strategy centers on meeting growing energy needs and powering the modern economy, while delivering reliable, affordable and cleaner energy to our customers and communities. To meet these goals, we are safely transforming and readying our system by investing in secure and innovative technologies, modernizing our gas and electric infrastructure and integrating efficiency and demand management programs. As we transition our business to meet anticipated increased long-term demand while delivering more efficient sources of energy, we are focused on creating sustainable value for our customers and shareholders by leveraging business transformation to exceed customer expectations, optimizing investments to drive attractive shareholder returns and providing new product offerings and solutions that deliver growth and customer value. To achieve these objectives, we are partnering with stakeholders, championing public policy that advances innovation and continuing to leverage regulatory models that support the delivery of reliable energy, timely cost recovery and affordable customer rates.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nThe matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments.\nRegulatory Matters\nCoal Ash Costs\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the 2024 CCR Rule. Cost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. For more information, see “Other Matters” and Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nStorm Cost Recovery\nFrom August through October 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Appropriate storm cost recovery mechanisms are in place to track and recover incremental costs from such events. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude has resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs and may impact the near-term results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the impacted registrants. For more information related to storm cost estimates, regulatory asset deferrals, and financing activities, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and Notes 4 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Debt and Credit Facilities.\"\nEPA Regulations of GHG Emissions\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued final rules under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants. Duke Energy is analyzing the potential impacts the rules could have on the Company, which could be material and may influence the timing, nature, and magnitude of future generation investments in our service territories. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the final rules. For more information, see \"Other Matters.\"\nSupply Chain\nThe Company continues to monitor the ongoing stability of markets for key materials and public policy outcomes, including the potential impacts from possible new tariffs or other actions from the new presidential administration that could disrupt or impact Duke Energy's supply chain, future financial results, capital plan execution or the achievement of its energy transition.\nGoodwill\nThe Duke Energy Registrants performed their annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31, 2024, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\" As of this date, all of the Duke Energy Registrants' reporting units' estimated fair values materially exceeded the carrying values except for the GU&I reporting unit of Duke Energy Ohio. While no goodwill impairment charges have been recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, the potential for deteriorating economic conditions impacting GU&I's future cash flows or equity valuations of peer companies could impact the estimated fair value of GU&I, and goodwill impairment charges could be recorded in the future. \nOther\nDuke Energy continues to monitor general market conditions, including the potential for interest rate pressures on the Company's cost of capital, which may impact Duke Energy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results, or the achievement of its energy transition.\n43\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. These items represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. \nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings and EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively. \nSpecial items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs: \n•\nOrganizational Optimization repres\nents costs associated with strategic repositioning to a fully regulated utility.\n•\nRegulatory Matters primarily represents net impairment charges related to Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' North Carolina and South Carolina rate case orders and Duke Energy Carolinas' North Carolina rate case settlement, and charges related to Duke Energy Indiana post-retirement benefits.\n•\nSystem Post-Implementation Costs represents the net impact of charges related to nonrecurring customer billing adjustments as a result of implementation of a new customer system.\n•\nPreferred Redemption Costs represents charges related to the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock.\n•\nNoncore Asset Sales and Net Impairments primarily represents charges related to certain joint venture electric transmission projects and certain renewable natural gas investments.\n•\nCaptive Storm Deductible represents charges related to an insurance deductible for Hurricane Helene property losses.\nDiscontinued operations primarily includes impairments on the sale of the Commercial Renewables business and results from Duke Energy's     Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.\nDuke Energy’s adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.\n44\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\nReconciliation of GAAP Reported Amounts to Adjusted Amounts\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nEarnings\nEPS\nEarnings\nEPS\nGAAP Reported Earnings/EPS\n$\n4,402\n \n$\n5.71\n \n$\n2,735 \n$\n3.54 \nAdjustments to Reported:\nOrganizational Optimization\n(a)\n—\n \n—\n \n95 \n0.13 \nRegulatory Matters\n(b)\n43\n \n0.06\n \n64 \n0.08 \nSystem Post-Implementation Costs\n(c)\n16\n \n0.02\n \n— \n— \nPreferred Redemption Costs\n(d)\n16\n \n0.02\n \n— \n— \nNoncore Asset Sales and Net Impairments\n(e)\n54\n \n0.07\n \n— \n— \nCaptive Storm Deductible\n(f)\n18\n \n0.02\n \n— \n— \nDiscontinued Operations\n(g)\n(7)\n(0.01)\n1,391 \n1.81 \nAdjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS\n$\n4,542\n \n$\n5.90\n \n$\n4,285 \n$\n5.56 \nNote: Total EPS may not foot due to rounding.\n(a)    Net of tax benefit of $29 million. $110 million recorded within Operations, maintenance and other and $14 million within Impairment of assets and other charges.\n(b)    \nNet of tax benefits of $15 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. $42 million recorded within Impairment of assets and other charges, $29 million recorded within Operating revenues, $2 million within Operations, maintenance and other, $11 million reduction recorded within Interest Expense, and a $4 million reduction within NCI for the year ended December 31, 2024. $68 million within Impairment of assets and other charges and $16 million within Operations, maintenance and other for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n(c)    Net of tax benefit of $5 million. \n$17 million recorded within Operating Revenues, $1 million recorded within Operations, maintenance and other, and $3 million recorded within Other income and expenses.\n(d)    \nRecorded within Preferred Redemption Costs.\n(e)    Net of $11 million tax benefit. $69 million recorded within Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and $4 million recorded within Gains on sales of other assets and other, net. \n(f)    Net of $5 million tax benefit. $23 million recorded within Operations, maintenance and other.\n(g)    Recorded in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, and Net Income (Loss) Attributable to NCI.\nYear Ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023\nGAAP Reported EPS was $5.71 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.54 for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition \nto the drivers below, the increase in GAAP Reported Earnings/EPS was also due to higher impairments on the sale of the Commercial Renewables business in the prior year.\nAs discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy’s adjusted EPS was $5.90 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $5.56 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Adjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS was primarily due t\no growth from rate increases and riders, improved weather and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher interest expense, depreciation on a growing asset base and storm costs, along with a higher effective tax rate.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to NCI and preferred stock dividends.

Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations. \nManagement discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.\nFor further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulated Operations Accounting\nSubstantially all of Duke Energy’s regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred. \nManagement continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as:\n•\napplicable regulatory environment changes;\n•\nhistorical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy’s jurisdictions;\n57\nMD&A\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n•\nlitigation of rate orders;\n•\nrecent rate orders to other regulated entities;\n•\nlevels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and\n•\nthe status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. \nIf future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets.\nAs required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity-specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.\nFor further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nDuke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2024. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2024, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.\nEstimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy’s internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2024 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company-specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2024, for each of Duke Energy’s reporting units ranged from 6.3% to 6.5%. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management’s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.\nOne of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer’s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31. The implied market multiples used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2024, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 9.1 to 11.7.\nDuke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy’s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates or implied market multiples over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.\nDuke Energy has $19.3 billion in Goodwill at both December 31, 2024, and 2023. For further information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Duke Energy has $10.0 billion and $9.2 billion of AROs as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. See Note 10, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" for further details including a rollforward of related liabilities.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, regulatory, legal, and legislative decisions, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change.\nObligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2020, Duke Energy Florida, closed an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station after receiving approval from the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet-to-be-built DOE facility.\n58\nMD&A\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nObligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. In April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreements.\nFor further information, see Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuke Energy calculated an estimated impairment on the disposition of its Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups as of December 31, 2022. The impairment was recorded to write-down the carrying amount to fair value, less cost to sell. The fair value was primarily determined from the income approach using discounted cash flows, but also considered market information obtained through the bidding process. Estimated future cash flows under the income approach were based on Duke Energy's forecast, which was informed by existing power purchase agreements with offtakers and forward merchant curves. Significant assumptions used in the income approach include forward merchant curves and discount rates. The discount rates considered both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. Duke Energy monitored the sales of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups and recorded adjustments to the impairments as warranted by progression in the disposition process and changes in market information. \nThe actual losses for the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups could differ from the estimated losses recorded as of December 31, 2024, as the disposition process is finalized, but any differences are not expected to be material.\nFor further information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Dispositions.\"\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy’s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes and projected tax credits to be generated relating to the IRA, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer until around 2030. In 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress began recording nuclear PTC deferred tax assets related to the IRA and began monetizing the PTCs in the transferability markets established by the IRA beginning in October 2024. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress\n are working with the state utility commissions on the appropriate regulatory process to pass the net realizable value back to customers over time. \nSee Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Income Taxes,\" for more information.\nFrom August through October 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. As discussed in Note \n4\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude has resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs. See \"Matters Impacting Future Results\" for further details and Note \n7\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for information regarding term loans executed in response to these major storm events. \nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Dispositions,\" for the timing and use of proceeds from the sale of certain Commercial Renewables assets to affiliates of Brookfield and ArcLight.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business secto\nrs. Duke Energy’s projected capital and investment expenditures, including AFUDC debt and capitalized interest, for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.\n(in millions) \n2025\n2026\n2027\nElectric Generation\n(a)\n$\n4,500 \n$\n5,900 \n$\n7,700 \nElectric Transmission\n2,675 \n2,450 \n2,575 \nElectric Distribution\n5,375 \n4,575 \n4,325 \nEnvironmental and Other\n775 \n825 \n575 \nTotal EU&I\n13,325 \n13,750 \n15,175 \nGU&I\n1,175 \n1,100 \n1,050 \nOther \n350 \n350 \n375 \nTotal projected capital and investment expenditures \n$\n14,850 \n$\n15,200 \n$\n16,600 \n(a)    Includes nuclear fuel of approximat\ne\nly $2.1 billion in 2025-2027.\n59\nMD&A\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDebt\nLong-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Duke Energy Registrants. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for information regarding the Duke Energy Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2024, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years.\nAs discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" Duke Energy terminated and repaid CRC in March 2024, Duke Energy Florida terminated and repaid DEFR in April 2024 and Duke Energy Carolinas terminated and repaid DERF in January 2025. As a result of these repayments, CRC, DEFR and DERF have ceased operations and no longer acquire the receivables of Duke Energy’s subsidiaries. Duke Energy Progress continues to evaluate financing opportunities and anticipates termination and repayment of the borrowing facility of DEPR prior to its scheduled termination date in April 2025.\nFuel and Purchased Power\nFuel and purchased power includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission \ncapacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as NPNS. Duke Energy’s contractual cash obligations for fuel and purchased power as of December 31, 2024, are as follows:\nPayments Due by Period\n(in millions)\nTotal\nLess than 1 year (2025)\n2-3 years (2026 & 2027)\n4-5 years (2028 & 2029)\nMore than 5 years (2030 & beyond)\nFuel and purchased power\n$\n21,695 \n$\n5,080 \n$\n6,706 \n$\n3,062 \n$\n6,847 \nOther Purchase Obligations\nOther purchase obligations includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services, contractual obligations for Engineering, Procurement, and Construction agreement costs for new generation plants, solar facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and \nday-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. Total cash commitments for related other purchase obligation expenditures ar\ne $13,336 million, with $13,015 million exp\nected to be paid in the next 12 m\nonths. \nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Leases” for a schedule of both finance lease and operating lease payments over the next five years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations” for information on nuclear decommissioning trust funding obligations and the closure of ash impoundments.\nDuke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased nonperformance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Guarantees and Indemnifications,” for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy’s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed in Note 8 and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities.\"\nCash and Liquidity\nThe Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for additional information on the money pool arrangement.\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy’s current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Duke Energy had approximate\nly $314 million of cash on hand, $5.8 billion available u\nnder its $9 billion Master Credit Facility. Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs. Refer to Notes 7 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Stockholders' Equity,\" respectively, for information regarding Duke Energy's debt and equity issuances, debt maturities and available credit facilities including the Master Credit Facility.\nCredit Facilities and Registration Statements\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants. \n60\nMD&A\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDividend Payments\nIn 2024, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 98th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 60% and 70%, based upon adjusted EPS. Duke Energy increased the dividend by approximately 2% annually\n in both 2024 and 2023, and the Company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend.\nDividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” Duke Energy’s public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working ca\npital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2024, the amount of restricted net assets of subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy’s net assets\n. Other than a prohibition from declaring common stock dividends should dividend payments be deferred on the Series A Preferred Stock, Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy’s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations of EU&I and GU&I are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy’s operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.\nAs part of Duke Energy’s continued effort to improve its cash flows from operations and liquidity, Duke Energy works with vendors to improve terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. To support this effort, Duke Energy has a voluntary supply chain finance program (the “program”) under which suppliers, at their sole discretion, may sell their receivables from Duke Energy to the participating financial institution. The financial institution administers the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier’s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program. Suppliers’ decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy’s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of Duke Energy, economic downturn or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions willingness to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not believe such risk would have a material impact on our cash flows from operations or liquidity, as substantially all our payments are made outside the program.\nDuke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information).\nDebt and Equity Issuances\nDepending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.\nIn 2025, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional securities of $12.2 billion through debt capital markets. In certain instances, Duke Energy may utilize instruments other than senior notes, including equity-content securities such as subordinated debt or preferred stock. Proceeds will primarily be for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant debt issuances. In addition, in order to fund incremental growth capital, Duke Energy plans to issue $6.5 billion of common stock equity from 2025-2029, including $1 billion in 2025, through the dividend reinvestment and ATM programs. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Stockholders’ Equity” for further details.\nDuke Energy’s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. \n \nProjected 2025\nActual 2024\nActual 2023\nEquity \n38 \n%\n38\n \n%\n39 \n%\nDebt \n62 \n%\n62\n \n%\n61 \n%\n61\nMD&A\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nDuke Energy’s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. The Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all other covenants related to their debt agreements as of December 31, 2024. \nI\nn addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\nCredit Ratings\nMoody’s Investors Service, Inc. and S&P provide credit ratings for various Duke Energy Registrants.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies’ assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes Duke Energy’s cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions) \n2024\n2023\nCash flows provided by (used in): \nOperating activities \n$\n12,328\n \n$\n9,878 \nInvesting activities \n(13,123)\n(12,475)\nFinancing activities \n859\n \n2,351 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n64\n \n(246)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period \n357\n \n603 \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period \n$\n421\n \n$\n357 \n62\nMD&A\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOPERATING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s operating cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions) \n2024\n2023\nVariance\nNet income \n$\n4,614\n \n$\n2,874 \n$\n1,740 \nNon-cash adjustments to net income \n7,181\n \n7,486 \n(305)\nContributions to qualified pension plans\n(100)\n(100)\n— \nPayments for AROs\n(545)\n(632)\n87 \nWorking capital \n1,897\n \n(1,248)\n3,145 \nOther assets and Other liabilities\n(719)\n1,498 \n(2,217)\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n$\n12,328\n \n$\n9,878 \n$\n2,450 \nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $1,435 million increase in net income, after adjustment for non-cash items, primarily due to growth from rate increases and riders, improved weather, higher sales volumes, and net proceeds from the sales of transferable tax credits, partially offset by higher interest expense and storm costs, along with a higher effective tax rate; and\n•\nan $928 million increase in net working capital and changes in other assets and liabilities amounts, primarily due to higher recovery of deferred fuel costs and the timing of accruals and payments, partially offset by higher deferred storm costs.\nINVESTING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s investing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions) \n2024\n2023\nVariance\nCapital, investment and acquisition expenditures, net of return of investment capital\n$\n(12,263)\n$\n(12,622)\n$\n359 \nDebt and equity securities, net \n100\n \n63 \n37 \nProceeds from the sales of Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups and other assets, net of cash divested\n49\n \n883 \n(834)\nOther investing items \n(1,009)\n(799)\n(210)\nNet cash used in investing activities \n$\n(13,123)\n$\n(12,475)\n$\n(648)\nThe variance relates primarily to the disposal of the Commercial Renewables business, with higher sales proceeds received in the prior year, partially offset by lower capital expenditures in the current year.\nThe primary use of cash related to investing activities is typically capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, net of return of investment capital, detailed by reportable business segment in the following table. \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions) \n2024\n2023\nVariance\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\n$\n10,689\n \n$\n10,135 \n$\n554 \nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\n1,313\n \n1,492 \n(179)\nOther \n261\n \n995 \n(734)\nTotal capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, net of return of investment capital\n$\n12,263\n \n$\n12,622 \n$\n(359)\nFINANCING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s financing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions) \n2024\n2023\nVariance\nIssuances of long-term debt, net \n$\n5,599\n \n$\n5,291 \n$\n308 \nIssuances of common stock\n405\n \n8 \n397 \nRedemption of preferred stock\n(1,000)\n— \n(1,000)\nNotes payable and commercial paper \n(927)\n142 \n(1,069)\nDividends paid \n(3,213)\n(3,244)\n31 \nContributions from noncontrolling interests\n47\n \n278 \n(231)\nOther financing items \n(52)\n(124)\n72 \nNet cash provided by financing activities \n$\n859\n \n$\n2,351 \n$\n(1,492)\n63\nMD&A\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $1,069 million decrease in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper;\n•\na $1,000 million decrease due to the redemption of Series B preferred stock in the current year;

Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework. \nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\nCommodity Price Risk\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy’s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the effects of regulation, commodity contract size and length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets.\nDuke Energy’s exposure to these fluctuations through its regulated utility operations is limited since these operations are subject to cost-based regulation and are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations.\nDuke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Derivatives and Hedging.”\nGeneration Portfolio Risks\nFor the EU&I segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is limited due to mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of most of the net profits from these activities with retail customers.\nHedging Strategies\nDuke Energy monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas hedging contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy’s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers.\nDuke Energy also manages its exposure to basis risk through the use of congestion hedge products in RTOs such as financial transmission rights (PJM and MISO),\n \nwhich result in payments based on differentials in locational marginal prices. The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy’s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract’s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.\n64\nMD&A\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” “Debt and Credit Facilities,” “Derivatives and Hedging,” and “Fair Value Measurements.”\nDuke Energ\ny ha\nd $6.6 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2024. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $70 million at December 31, 2024. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2024.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as a result of its issuances of long-term debt denominated in a foreign currency. Duke Energy manages foreign currency exchange risk exposure by entering into cross-currency swaps, a type of financial derivative instrument, which mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure. See Notes 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” “Derivatives and Hedging” and “Fair Value Measurements,\" respectively.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits. \nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants’ internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions. \nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Derivatives and Hedging,” for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments. \nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ credit risk. \nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants’ credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants’ service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. \nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers. \nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Guarantees and Indemnifications,” for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants. \n65\nMD&A\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nDuke Energy is subject to credit risk from transactions with counterparties to cross-currency swaps related to future interest and principal payments. The credit exposure to such counterparties may take the form of higher costs to meet Duke Energy's future euro-denominated interest and principal payments in the event of counterparty default. Duke Energy selects highly rated banks as counterparties and allocates the hedge for each debt issuance across multiple counterparties. The master agreements with the counterparties impose collateral requirements on the parties in certain circumstances indicative of material deterioration in a party's creditworthiness.\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants’ policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.\nMarketable Securities Price Risk\nAs described further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nPension Plan Assets\nDuke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Employee Benefit Plans,” for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.\nA significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy’s results of operations in those periods.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nAs required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2024, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. \nAccounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the funds will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” for additional information regarding NDTF assets.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\nGHG Standards and Guidelines\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued final rules under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants, referred to as electric generating units (EGUs). EPA Rule 111 requires existing coal-fired power plants expected to operate in 2039 and beyond to reduce GHG emissions by 90% through the use of carbon capture and sequestration starting in 2032, subject to certain modifications for coal plants that retire sooner and co-fire natural gas. EPA Rule 111 also establishes GHG emissions reduction standards for new natural gas-fired EGUs, subject to carve-outs for smaller peaking units that fill gaps that cannot be met with renewables or storage. The EPA did not finalize emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbines and signaled, before the 2024 election, that it intended to address these in a future rulemaking. Duke Energy is analyzing the potential impacts the rules could have on the Company, which could be material and may influence the timing, nature, and magnitude of future generation investments in our service territories. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to EPA Rule 111 as a member of Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition, a coalition of similarly affected utilities, and as a member of a utility trade group. The litigation is currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the Court). On February 5, 2025, the EPA requested the Court to withhold issuing an opinion and place the case in a 60-day abeyance to allow time for new EPA leadership to review the issues and EPA Rule 111 and determine how they wish to proceed. On February 19, 2025, the Court granted EPA’s request.\n66\nMD&A\nOTHER MATTERS\nCoal Combustion Residuals\nIn April 2015, EPA published the 2015 CCR Rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule established requirements regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirements to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR.\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments). The final rule also imposes a subset of the 2015 CCR Rule’s requirements, including groundwater monitoring, corrective action (where necessary), and in certain cases, closure, and post-closure care requirements, on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR Management Units). CCR Management Units may include surface impoundments and landfills that closed prior to the effectiv\ne date of the 2015 CCR Rule, inactive CCR landfills, and other areas where CCR is managed directly on the land at Duke Energy facilitie\ns. Duke Energy, as part of a group of similarly affected electric utilities, filed a petition to challenge the 2024 CCR Rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the Court) on August 6, 2024. On February 13, 2025, the EPA requested the Court to withhold issuing an opinion and place the case in a 120-day abeyance to allow time for new EPA leadership to review the issues and the 2024 CCR Rule and determine how they wish to proceed. On that same day, the Court granted EPA’s motion to hold the case in abeyance pending further order of the Court.\nIn addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rules, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by the states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively. \nCoal Ash Act\nAROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the federal CCR rules and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. \nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate six of the nine remaining coal ash basins with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the three remaining basins at Belews Creek, Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Belews Creek, Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will be addressed as required under the 2024 CCR Rule and state regulations.\nThe estimated total cost to permanently close all coal ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is estimated to be approximately $8 billion to $9 billion of which approximately $4.4 billion has been spent through 2024. The majority of the remaining spend is primarily expected to occur over the next 10 years. Duke Energy has completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend, Dan River, Asheville and Sutton plants.\nFor further information on coal ash basins and recovery, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and “Asset Retirement Obligations,” respectively.\nOther Environmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nGlobal Climate Change and Regulation of GHG Emissions\nOn January 20, 2025, the new presidential administration signed an executive order directing the United States to again withdraw from the Paris Agreement and signed a letter to the United Nations notifying the world body of the planned withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will become official one year after the submission of the letter. In 2021, the previous presidential administration had recommitted to the Paris Agreement and announced a target of 50% to 52% reduction in economywide net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. submittal to support this Paris target included a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. These actions were supplemented by a number of executive orders and a number of proposed and final rules from federal regulatory agencies, including the EPA, that would have imposed additional regulations on CO\n2\n and methane emissions which could impact Duke Energy. The Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring these matters and any potential changes in commitments, regulations or additional executive actions as a result of the new presidential administration and cannot predict the outcome, however, there could be a material impact on our energy transition.\nEU&I CO\n2\n Emissions Reductions\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ direct GHG emissions consist primarily of CO\n2\n that results primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants to serve its customers reliably and affordably. Duke Energy is targeting at least a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels from electric generation by 2030, an 80% reduction by 2040, and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In February 2022, Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from upstream purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream customer use of natural gas, were added \nto our 20\n50 net-zero goal with an interim goal of reducing these emissions by 50% below 2021 levels by 2035. \n67\nMD&A\nOTHER MATTERS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO\n2\n emissions over time\n. Between 2005 and 2024, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO\n2\n emissions from their electricity generation by 44%. Tim\nelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future GHG emission reductions will vary in each state in which the Company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. Duke Energy's goals and actions taken to reduce CO\n2\n emissions potentially lower the exposure to any future mandatory CO\n2\n emission reduction requirements, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirements. \nActions to reduce CO\n2\n emissions have included the retirement of 58 coal-fired electric generating units with a combined generating capacity of over 8,000 MW, whil\ne investing in renewables and energy storage and state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO\n2\n emissions per unit of electricity generated than coal. Duke Energy also has made investments to increase EE offerings and ensure continued operations of its zero-CO\n2\n emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified our electric generating system and significantly reduced CO\n2\n emissions. \nDuke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology, as well as developing technologies, to meet customer demand reliably and affordably while reducing CO\n2\n emissions to achieve its net-zero goal as well as to comply with any future regulations. These technologies include EE, wind, solar and storage, as well as evolving technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage, the use of hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels, long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear. Duke Energy plans to adjust to and incorporate these evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability of energy while meeting regulatory requirements and customer demands. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO\n2\n limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. Future levels of CO\n2\n emissions by the Duke Energy Registrants will be influenced by variables that include customer growth and capacity needs in the jurisdictions in which they operate, public policy, tax incentives, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, weather conditions, fuel prices, market prices, availability of resources and labor, compliance with new or existing regulations, the ability to make enhancements to transmission and distribution systems to support increased deployment of renewables and behind-the-meter technologies and the existence of new technologies that can be deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet customer demand.\nCurrently, the Duke Energy Registrants do not purchase carbon credits or offsets for use in connection with the Company's net-zero CO\n2\n emissions goals. Though they may purchase carbon credits or offsets for such uses in the future, the amount or cost of which is not expected to be material at this time.\nGeneration Portfolio Planning Process\nThe Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the Company’s thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the demand for electricity as well as the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term generation resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account stakeholder input as well as forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\nIn 2021, the state of North Carolina passed HB 951, which among other things, directed the NCUC to develop and approve a carbon reduction plan that would target a 70% reduction in CO\n2\n emissions from Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Carolinas' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology. In December 2022, the NCUC issued an order adopting the first Carbon Plan as directed by HB 951 with the Carbon Plan to be updated every two years thereafter.\nIn August 2023,\n Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their 2023 systemwide Carolinas Resource Plan (the Plan) with the NCUC and PSCS\nC. T\nhe Plan provided a range of generation options, including three core portfolios, reflecting an “all of the above” approach to powering the energy needs of our growing region. In the Plan, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recommended one of the three core portfolios presented, Portfolio 3, as the most prudent path forward to comply with applicable state laws, providing a reliable and orderly energy transition that was proposed as the most reasonable and lowest-cost plan for the Carolinas. In November 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress provided notice to the NCUC and PSCSC of a substantially increased load forecast resulting from increased economic development in the Carolinas occurring since the Plan was prepared. The companies filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC in January 2024, demonstrating the need for additional resources beyond the initial set of resources identified by the companies in their initial plan.\nIn July 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached a broad settlement in the NCUC proceeding with the Public Staff, Walmart, and the Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association on the Plan, agreeing it is reasonable to use Portfolio 3 as the reference portfolio for planning purposes. Among other things, the settlement confirms a set of near-term activities, including development and procurement activities for solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and certain natural gas generation assets, as well as certain limited actions exploring initial development activities related to advanced nuclear, offshore wind, and to advance the potential for 1,834 MW of pumped storage hydro at the Bad Creek II facility by 2034. The NCUC conducted evidentiary hearings in July and August 2024 and issued an order accepting the settlement and providing further direction in November 2024. The order continues to emphasize the critical importance of reliability and maintaining affordability, while taking balanced actions to meet forecasted load growth. Additionally, the NCUC directed the Company to continue to pursue the merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. As a condition of the NCUC approval of the Duke Energy and Progress Energy merger in 2012, the NCUC instructed the Company to consider a merger between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Since that time, the Company has analyzed, and continues to analyze, the possibility of such a combination, and the Company anticipates beginning merger-related filings with the NCUC, PSCSC and FERC in the second half of 2025. The Company is currently targeting a completion date for the merger of January 1, 2027. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the approval of the NCUC or PSCSC, or other required regulatory approvals, for the potential merger.\nThe PSCSC held its hearings in September 2024 and in November 2024 issued an order approving the Plan and directed Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to work with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff to provide alternative modeling around EPA Rule 111 compliance in a subsequent Carolinas Resource Plan filing.\n68\nMD&A\nOTHER MATTERS\nIn November 2024, Duke Energy Indiana submitted its updated IRP, which balances reliability and affordability while meeting customer and economic development growth.\nGU&I CO\n2\n and Methane Emissions Reductions\nIn addition to CO\n2\n emissions resulting primarily from our operations of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants are also responsible for certain methane emissions from the distribution of natural gas to customers. Duke Energy has a goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution business by 2030. The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in methane emission reductions, including the replacement of cast iron and bare steel pipelines and associated services with plastic or coated steel, advanced methane leak detection efforts, reducing time to repair nonhazardous leaks and operational releases of methane, and investment in renewable natural gas.\nTimelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future reductions of upstream methane emissions will vary in each state in which the Company’s natural gas distribution business operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. EPA has issued regulations that would require reduction of methane emissions upstream of the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution business. The impact of these regulations on natural gas fuel prices is not currently quantifiable.\nCertain local governments, none within the jurisdictions in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate, have enacted or are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in new buildings and focus on electrification. Enactment of similar regulations in the areas in which the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution operates could have a significant impact on the natural gas distribution business and its operations. At this time, such impacts are not able to be quantified; however, our net-zero methane goals for the natural gas distribution business, as well as the actions taken to reduce these GHG emissions, potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs with any new regulations through the regulatory process.\nPhysical Impacts of Climate Change\nThe Duke Energy Registrants recognize that scientists associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere. It is possible that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating with any certainty any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations difficult. Additionally, \nthe Duke Energy Registrants would plan to continue to seek recovery of storm costs through the appropriate regulatory mechanisms. For more information on storm securitization and storm cost recovery, see Note \n4\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nThe Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to assess and reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric transmission and distribution systems and natural gas facilities. The steps include modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing systems and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants’ electric generating facilities and natural gas facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain inventories of coal, oil and liquified natural gas to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity and/or natural gas. \nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for a discussion of the impact of any new accounting standards adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants.",
