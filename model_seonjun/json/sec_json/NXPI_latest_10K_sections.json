Semiconductors vary significantly depending upon the specific function or application of the end product in which the semiconductor is used and the customer who is deploying it. Semiconductors also vary on a number of technical characteristics including the degree of integration, level of customization, programmability and the process technology utilized to manufacture the semiconductor. Advances in semiconductor technology have increased the functionality and performance of semiconductors, improving their features and power consumption characteristics while reducing their size and cost. These advances have resulted in growth of semiconductors and electronic content across a diverse array of products. The semiconductor market totaled $627.6 billion in 2024.\nBusiness Combinations\nOn December 17, 2024, NXP entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aviva Links for $242.5 million in cash.

The four end markets are Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Mobile, and Communication Infrastructure & Other. \nAutomotive\nIndustrial & IoT\nMobile\nComm Infra & Other\nCore\nAuto MCU (non-S32)\nIn-vehicle infotainment (IVI)\nIn-vehicle networking (IVN)\nAdvanced Analog\nSecure Car Access\nProcessors\nAnalog & Security\nConnectivity\nSecure Mobile payment &\nAccess Solutions\nCustom Analog Interfaces\nSecure Card Solutions\nLegacy Networking\nProcessors\nRF Power Amplifiers\nAccelerated Growth\nSDV\nRadar Systems\nElectrification\nConnectivity\nIntelligent Edge Systems\ni.\nAutomotive\nGrowth in automotive semiconductor sales relies on (1) global vehicle sales and production trends and (2) the increase in semiconductor content per vehicle. In the past few years, and going forward, we believe the latter will be the most important driver for growth in the automotive semiconductor market, while the stagnation of global vehicle sales and production will make the former less relevant. The increase of the average semiconductor content is being driven by the proliferation of electronic features throughout the vehicle, especially for driver assistance (ADAS), and by the increasing penetration of electrified vehicles, which have much higher semiconductors content. \nWe believe three mega-trends will drive the semiconductor content increase in the future: Autonomous driving, electrification and the software defined vehicle. Each of the megatrends involve new functions and each new function requires new technologies. The path to full autonomy is driving the increase of driver assistance systems in the car already today. In the same way, strict emissions regulations as well as consumer willingness for energy efficient cars are accelerating the penetration of electrification. Last but not least, many consumers want their cars to be service oriented, hyper-connected, configurable and upgradeable, in the same way as they are used to with their smartphones. We expect such consumer demands will lead to new vehicle architectures and eventually to software defined vehicles (SDV). \nSemiconductor content per vehicle continues to increase due to government regulation of safety and emissions, standardization of higher-end options across a greater number of vehicle classes as well as consumer demand for greater fuel efficiency, advanced safety, multimedia applications and connectivity. Automotive safety features are evolving from passive safety systems to active safety systems with Advanced Driving Assisted Systems (ADAS) such as radar and vision systems. Semiconductor content is also increasing in engine management and fuel economy applications, like Battery Management Systems (BMS). Comfort and convenience systems and user interface applications, as well as infotainment features such as digital audio broadcasting are also areas with high semiconductor content increases. In addition, the use of networking in automotive applications continues to increase as various subsystems communicate within the automobile and with external devices and networks. Furthermore, we believe networking will play a key role in the electrical/electronic architecture transformation towards domain and zonal architectures. Smart car access, automotive Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Near-Field Communication (NFC) are gaining ground in automotive as well, enabling the connection of vehicles and car keys to portable devices and the infrastructure. Data integrity and security hardware features for safeguarding memory, communication and system data are also increasing in importance.   \nDue to the high degree of regulatory scrutiny and safety requirements, the automotive semiconductor market is characterized by stringent qualification processes, zero defect quality processes, functionally safe design architecture, high reliability, extensive design-in timeframes and long product life cycles, which results in significant barriers to entry. \n4\nii.\nIndustrial & IoT\n \nThe world is becoming smarter, more connected and more data driven, and the Industrial & IoT market sits at the center of this global digital transformation. The Industrial & IoT market is highly fragmented with a diverse collection of products and applications such as factory automation, home and building automation, appliances, home entertainment, power and energy and healthcare solutions.   \nThe need for productivity increase requiring real-time insights and efficient processes for factory automation, the reduction of resource consumption and better energy efficiency for smart factories and buildings, the enhancement in consumer convenience security and comfort for smart homes, the increase in performance requirements for processing content in smart consumer devices, the need for better health prevention and monitoring solutions, are some of the key use-cases and trends driving growth in Industrial & IoT. Carbon emissions reduction efforts (global net zero emission commitments) will also be a key growth driver with large transformations expected of our energy systems. Factories, buildings and homes will need to rely much more on renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind) and increase efficient use of energy. The way we generate and store energies will likely be more distributed. The energy ecosystem needs to develop and ensure smart, efficient and reliable power delivery.\nThese trends drive the replacement of traditional mechanical equipment by smart, energy-saving and connected electronic equipment using various sensors, processors, connectivity, analog and security chipsets that align well with NXP’s portfolio and ability to provide customers with system solutions across these applications segments. \nFinally, with the growing number of connected devices and increasing data generation, latency, privacy and bandwidth have become critical limiting factors. Intelligent edge solutions solve this by bringing the intelligence closer to the source. Edge systems reduce the tendency on the cloud, lowering power consumption, strengthening data protection. They are, most of the time, autonomous and real-time. They handle data and do decisions locally. NXP's scalable low power solutions across the entire embedded processing spectrum are ideally suited here.  \niii.\nMobile\n \nMobile includes applications such as smartphones, feature phones, tablets, wearables and mobile accessories. NXP has a strong focus on mobile wallet, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and specialty custom analog solutions. The demand for faster speeds, improved battery life, fast charging, mobile wallets, highly secure localization and sensing technology, mobile transit and authentication is driving increased semiconductor content for NXP. The growth in this market is mainly driven by the increasing attach rate of these features across devices, vendors and regions, from flagship smartphones down to feature phones, from developed countries to emerging regions. UWB, thanks to its unique precision, robustness, and reliability, is emerging as a secure, fine-ranging technology capable of enabling a wide range of innovative location-based user experiences. The technology is gaining momentum thanks to wider chipset availability, adoption across various devices by multiple brands, and the formation of a strong UWB ecosystem across the whole supply chain where NXP is well positioned. \niv.\nCommunication Infrastructure & Other\n \nThe Communication Infrastructure & Other end market is a combination of three different application markets, namely secure edge identification, 5G radio power and digital network communication solutions. \nIn secure edge identification solutions, NXP has extensive experience providing customers with solutions for applications demanding the highest security and reliability (ePassports, eID credentials, transportation & payment cards. Included as well is the growing RFID market that uses wireless technology for identification and tracking of objects. Further digitalization of governmental services, the trend towards secure contactless payment and the need to improve tracking, traceability and authentication of products are driving demand across these applications.\nMost countries in the world have migrated their wireless infrastructure to 5G network technology. This application market provides base station radio units with power amplifiers for improved signal throughput and efficiency.\n5\nFinally, the increasing number of connected devices exchanging more data in the cloud and on the device edge, combined with demand for improved digital communication drives demand in the network communications market. \nProducts \nWe offer customers a broad portfolio of semiconductor products, including microcontrollers, application processors, communication processors, connectivity chipsets, analog and interface devices, RF power amplifiers, security controllers and sensors.

These security controller ICs are suited for applications demanding the highest security and reliability. Nearly all of our security products consist of multi-functional solutions comprised of passive RF connectivity devices facilitating information transfer from the user document to reader infrastructure; secure, tamper-proof microcontroller devices in which information is securely \n7\nencrypted (“secure element”); and secure real-time operating system software products to facilitate the encryption-decryption of data, and the interaction with the reader infrastructure systems. Our solutions are developed to provide extreme levels of security of user information, undergoing stringent and continued global governmental and banking certification processes, and to deliver a high level of device performance enabling significant throughput and productivity to our customers. \nviii.\nSensors\n \nSensors serve as a primary interface in embedded systems for advanced human interface and contextual awareness that mimic the human “5 senses” interaction with the external environment. We provide several categories of semiconductor-based environmental and inertial sensors for the Automotive market, including pressure, inertial, magnetic and gyroscopic sensors that provide orientation detection, gesture recognition, tilt to scroll functionality and position detection. \nManufacturing \nWe manufacture semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities, a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization, purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses. \nThe manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production, which can be broadly divided into “front-end” and “back-end” processes. Front-end processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities (called fabrication plants or “wafer fabs”), and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function. The front-end production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps. Back-end processes involve the assembly, test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution. In contrast to the highly complex front-end process, back-end processing is generally less complicated, and as a result we tend to determine the location of our back-end facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations. \nWe primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features, and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at third-party wafer foundries when it is economical to do so. In addition, we increasingly focus our in-house manufacturing on our competitive 8-inch wafer facilities, which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer, 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes. This focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures. \nOur front-end manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods, including complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), bipolar, bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) and double-diffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor (DMOS) technologies. Our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 0.5 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes. This broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions, which require a variety of technologies. \nOur back-end manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes. To optimize flexibility, we use shared technology platforms for our back-end assembly operations. Most of our assembly and test activities are maintained in-house. \n8\nThe following table shows selected key information with respect to our major operating front-end and back-end facilities:\nSite\nOwnership\nWafer sized used\nLine widths used (vm)\nTechnology/Products\n(Microns)\nFront-end\nSingapore (SSMC)¹⁾\n61.2 \n%\n8”\n0.14-0.25\nCMOS, eNVM, Power, BCDMOS, RF\nNijmegen, the Netherlands\n100 \n%\n8”\n0.14-1.00\nCMOS, BCDMOS, RF, Power MOSFET\nChandler, United States\n100 \n%\n8”\n0.18-0.50\nCMOS, eNVM, BCDMOS\nChandler RF, United States\n100 \n%\n6”\n0.25-0.40\nGaN\nAustin (Ed Bluestein), United States\n100 \n%\n8”\n0.09-0.18\nCMOS, eNVM, BCDMOS, Radar\nBack-end\nKaohsiung, Taiwan\n100 \n%\n— \n—\n \nNFC, Automotive Car-access, In-Vehicle Networking, Micro-controllers, ADAS (Radar), Analog, Mixed-Signal and Power\nBangkok, Thailand\n100 \n%\n— \n— \nAutomotive In-Vehicle Networking and Sensors, Analog, RFID, Banking and e-Passport modules, Power Management\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n100 \n%\n— \n— \nMicro-processors, ADAS/Radar, Micro-controllers, Advanced Audio Processor, Sensors, Power Management, Analog and Mixed Signal, RF devices\nTianjin, China\n100 \n%\n— \n— \nMicro-processors, Micro-controllers, Power Management, Battery Management, Analog and Mixed Signal\n1)\n    Joint venture with TSMC.  \nWe use a large number of raw materials in our front- and back-end manufacturing processes, including silicon wafers, chemicals, gases, lead frames, substrates, molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals. Our most important raw materials are the raw, or substrate, silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors. We purchase these wafers, which must meet exacting specifications, from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located. At our wholly owned fabrication plants, we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size. Our SSMC wafer fab facility, which produces 8 inch wafers, is jointly owned by TSMC and ourselves. Emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and, accordingly, we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers. \nWe typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers, although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse. Some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a just-in-time basis, which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories, but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions. We purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts. \nIn recent years, as a result of constraints in the semiconductor supply chains, there has been a tendency towards longer term supply contracts with suppliers in exchange for capacity. From an operational perspective, all of our manufacturing facilities continue to operate around the world in accordance with guidance issued by local and national government authorities.\n9\nNXP also has equity investments in the following joint venture manufacturing companies:\n•\nEuropean Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH will build and operate a new 300mm semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility in Dresden, Germany. ESMC is 70% owned by TSMC, with Bosch, Infineon, and NXP each owning 10%. NXP is entitled to 10% of the fab facility capacity. Initial production at ESMC is currently targeted to begin in 2027.\n•\nVisionPower Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (VSMC) will build and operate a new 300mm semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility in Singapore. VSMC is 60% owned by Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation and 40% owned by NXP. NXP is entitled to 40% of the fab facility capacity. Initial production at VSMC is currently targeted to begin in 2027.\nSales, Marketing and Customers \nWe market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of OEMs, Electronic Manufacturing Service customers (EMSs) and Distributors. We generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers, and supporting their system design-in activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support. \nOur sales and marketing teams are organized into six regions, which are EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), the Americas, Japan, South Korea, China and South Asia Pacific. These sales regions are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development. In addition, our sales and marketing teams in the regions partner with our distributors and our large number of mass market customers. \nOur sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Communication Infrastructure, and Mobile deepening our relationship with our top OEMs and EMSs, expanding our reach to our mass market customers, startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier, which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets. We have long-standing customer relationships with most of our customers. Our 10 largest OEM end customers, some of whom are supplied by distributors, in alphabetical order, are Apple, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Harman Auto, Hyundai, LGE Automotive, Samsung and Visteon. We also have a strong position with our distribution partners, including our five largest in alphabetical order, Arrow, Avnet, Nexty, WT Micro and World Peace. \nOur revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to OEMs, EMSs plus our distributors’ resale of NXP products. Avnet accounted for 22% of our revenue in 2024 and 21% in 2023. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. No OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2024 or 2023. \nResearch and Development \nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. We direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth. We target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance. As new and challenging applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions. We have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in RF, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing. \nWith the intent to outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions, with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments, such as ADAS, in-vehicle networks and power management, as well as Edge computing to support the successful deployment in the IoT with our cross-over processing technology, but also in emerging markets, such as massive MIMO in RF Power and mmWave for 5G. In addition, we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our company's growth in the future. \n10\nWe annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources. For products targeting established markets, we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments. For break-through technologies and new market opportunities, we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market. Overall, we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses. \nSubsidies and Grants\nWe receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries in the form of direct grants as well as tax credits for R&D activities. Such funding is generally provided to encourage R&D activities, industrialization and local economic development and is generally available to all companies. The conditions for the receipt of government grants and subsidies may include eligibility restrictions, approval by relevant authorities, annual budget appropriations, compliance with relevant regulations or contingent return provisions, as well as specifications regarding objectives and results. The approval process for such funding may last up to several years.  Certain specific contracts require compliance with extensive regulatory requirements and set forth certain conditions relating to the funded programs.  There could be penalties if these objectives are not fulfilled. \nOur direct grants include those awarded under the European 2nd Important Project of Common European Interest on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (“IPCEI ME/CT”). During 2023 and 2024, the Company was granted IPCEI ME/CT government assistance in multiple EU member states. The duration of the IPCEI ME/CT grants is planned to run until the end of 2029. The conditions to receive the IPCEI ME/CT government assistance include restrictions on eligible expenditures, employment retention, annual budget appropriations by the member states, compliance with member states’ regulations and project objectives and results, as well as repayment conditions. Our dedicated R&D teams across the involved member states under the IPCEI ME/CT program seek to innovate in core technologies across automotive, industrial and cybersecurity. This includes 5nm, advanced driving assistance and battery management systems in automotive, 6G and Ultra-Wideband as well as artificial intelligence (AI), RISC-V and post-quantum cryptography.\nIntellectual Property \nThe creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents, trademarks, domain names, retaining trade secrets and defending, enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights, where appropriate. We believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies, and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development. We have a broad portfolio of approximately 9,600 patent families (each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same invention). To protect confidential technical information and software, we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable. In situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property, we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nWe own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. Where we consider it desirable, we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection. Our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and end-users. \nWhile our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets, we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole. We believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business. \nIn addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights, confidential technical \n11\ninformation, software and other technology owned by third parties. We also engage, in certain instances, in licensing and selling of certain of our technology, patents and other intellectual property rights. \nCompetition \nWe compete with many different semiconductor companies on a global basis, including with both integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) as well as fabless companies. Nearly all our competitors invest extensively in research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities across a broad spectrum of product lines. Many of our competitors are focused on single applications or market segments. Most of our competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our product lines.  \nOur primary key public competitors in alphabetical order include, but are not limited to, Analog Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Microchip Technology Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Renesas Electronics Corp., STMicroelectronics NV and Texas Instruments Inc. \nThe basis on which we compete varies across end markets and geographic regions. This includes competing on the basis of our ability to develop new products and the underlying intellectual property in a timely manner to meet customer requirements in terms of product features, quality, performance, warranty, availability and cost. In addition, we are asked to deliver full system capabilities which include multiple NXP devices and enabling software. This requires in-depth knowledge of specific applications in target markets in order to develop robust system solutions and qualified customer support resources.  \nSeasonality\nHistorically, our net revenue does not display consistent or predictable seasonal patterns.\nGovernment Regulation, including Environmental Regulation\nThe information set forth under the “Environmental remediation” caption of Note 15 of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference. For additional discussion of certain risks associated with government and environmental regulation, see Part I, Item 1A.\n Risk Factors\n.\nInformation about our Executive Officers \nThe names, ages and positions as of February 20, 2025, of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sievers, are as follows:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nKurt Sievers\n55\nExecutive director, president and chief executive officer\nBill Betz\n47\nExecutive vice president and chief financial officer\nChristopher Jensen\n55\nExecutive vice president and chief people officer\nAndrew Hardy\n48\nExecutive vice president and chief sales officer\nAndrew Micallef\n60\nExecutive vice president and chief operations and manufacturing officer\nJennifer Wuamett\n59\nExecutive vice president, general counsel, corporate secretary and chief sustainability officer\nHuman Capital\nAt the heart of NXP's is our talented global employees, referred to as team members, whose creativity and dedication drive the innovation that sets our company apart. Our purpose is to bring together bright minds to create breakthrough technologies that make the connected world better, safer, and more secure. Globally, we implement policies and programs designed to attract, engage and retain top talent. These efforts center around key priorities including team member engagement, thought leadership, inclusion, compensation and benefits, development and growth, future talent, team member retention and community outreach. \n12\nNXP’s workforce includes direct labor (DL) and indirect labor (IDL). DL are those team members directly involved in manufacturing our products, while IDL consists of individual contributors, managers and executives in other functions such as research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative roles (SG&A). At December 31, 2024, we had approximately 33,100 employees, which includes approximately 1,400 employees in our joint venture. Our NXP global workforce spans three regions encompassing 30+ countries and includes approximately 11,600 team members dedicated to the research and development of our products and solutions (representing 37% of our NXP workforce).\nCorporate Values, Team Member Engagement and Retention\nNXP's values are the cornerstone of how we operate, develop our teams, and foster innovation. Built on trust and respect, these principles guide every aspect of our talent strategy.\n \nTo assess and improve engagement, we consistently invite team members to share their feedback through the Winning Culture Survey, which covers various factors such as engagement and ethics. In our 2024 survey, 87% of our indirect-labor team members participated. \nNXP is dedicated to retaining team members and closely monitors voluntary turnover. During calendar year 2024, our voluntary attrition rate was 5.5%. We continue to drive programs centered around retention actions for strategic roles and top-performing talent as well as broad-based programs targeting all team members.  \nInclusion\nAt NXP, inclusion is integral to who we are. We value the unique talents, experiences, and perspectives that each team member brings to the workplace. Our inclusion approach is centered around the following:\n•\nLeadership commitment and ownership; \n•\nBuilding and sustaining a qualified talent pipeline and robust processes; and \n•\nFostering an inclusive culture and a sense of belonging to attract and retain the best talent.\n13\nNXP values team member engagement in driving inclusion through our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). Membership is open to all team members, and each ERG has defined missions and executive oversight. Today, we have nine primary ERGs with representation in Asia, Europe and North America. The Human Resources and C\nompensation Committee of our Board provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on human capital management, including workforce\n inclusion\n.\nFuture Talent and Development\nNXP’s dedication to new-in-career and internship programs plays a vital role in cultivating the next generation of talent. Additionally, through our partnerships and engagements with universities, we support advanced research programs and projects worldwide.\nNXP empowers team members to develop their professional skills and capabilities and is dedicated to a 70/20/10 continuous learning model, including mechanisms for learning through on-the-job experiences (70%), learning through others (20%), and learning through formal education (10%). Using a blend of internally designed and externally sourced courses and learning resources, we offer our global team members a variety of training programs in support of key business processes, requirements and initiatives.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide team members with total rewards packages including base salary and short-term and long-term incentives. In addition, we offer comprehensive benefits package that includes various offerings that support the overall health and well-being of our team members. \nWe believe that pay decisions should be made on four factors: external market conditions, employee performance/contributions, specific skills and internal equity. NXP has policies and procedures in place to promote pay equity and utilizes third-party data to formulate compensation and benefits programs that are fair, equitable and competitive. We perform pay reviews twice a year, alongside NXP's rewards processes, to ensure we are delivering pay decisions with an appropriate focus on fairness, reflecting our commitment to making compensation-related decisions based only on performance, tenure and skill related factors. We empower leaders to recognize both individual and team accomplishments. \n \nEmployee Health and Safety\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees, and we continuously assess safety risks globally to ensure workplace risks are mitigated. We are certified to the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System, and have developed robust safety programs and initiatives to safeguard our workforce. In 2024, we began an internal effort to increase safety awareness at all of our manufacturing sites via various programs including Safety Hero/Star, which recognizes employees who have fully embraced the safety-oriented mindset.\nEmployee Representation\nA number of our team members are members of a labor union and in various countries, local law requires us to inform and consult with employee representatives on matters relating to labor conditions. We have not experienced any material strikes or labor disputes in the past and consider our employee relations to be good.\nWe also have employee-lead worker’s councils in various countries that provide input and oversight to many of the decisions made on behalf of employees.\nClimate and Environment\nProtecting the environment is a key pillar in our Sustainability Policy and corporate strategy because we recognize the need to conserve the earth’s natural resources and reduce emissions. In support of this, we set company-wide aspirational targets intended to optimize our use of resources, minimize waste and continuously improve.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of potential global environmental risks that may adversely affect our business operations, such as climate change or natural disasters.\nWe go a step further, working beyond our operations, to help create a smarter, more sustainable world. We develop innovative product solutions that not only support our sustainability goals but also meet the objectives of our stakeholders. We stay informed about changes in global legislation, by tracking current discussions, timelines and the likelihood of new implementations, and include these potential legislative requirements when we plan for new \n14\nproduct introductions. By working to minimize the environmental impact of our products in the early stages of their development, we enable sustainable, green technologies that benefit both our company and our customers.\nAdditional information about our environmental strategy, targets and metrics is included in our Corporate Sustainability Report and can be found on our website\n1\n.\nAvailable Information\nOur main corporate website address is www.nxp.com.

We returned $2,411 million to our shareholders during the year in dividends and repurchases of common stock. Our cash position at the end of 2024 was $3,292 million.\nQuarter in Focus\n•\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $3.1 billion, down 9.1% year-on-year;\n•\nGAAP gross margin was 53.9%, and GAAP operating margin was 21.7%;\n•\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 57.5%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 34.2%;\n•\nCash flow from operations was $391 million, with net capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment of $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $292 million;\n•\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, NXP returned capital to shareholders with the payment of $258 million in cash dividends and the repurchase of $455 million of its common shares, for a total capital return of $713 million.\n35\nSequential Results\nQ4 2024 compared to Q3 2024\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $3,111 million compared to $3,250 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, a decrease of $139 million or 4.3% quarter-on-quarter. NXP experienced declines in the Industrial & IoT end market of $47 million or 8.3%, Communication Infrastructure & Other end market of $42 million or 9.3%, Automotive end market of $39 million or 2.1%, and Mobile end market of $11 million or 2.7%.\nWhen aggregating all end markets together and reviewing sales channel performance, revenue through NXP’s third party distribution partners was $1,763 million, a decrease of $134 million or 7.1% compared to the previous period. Revenue through NXP’s third party direct OEM and EMS customers was $1,321 million, consistent with the previous period.\nFrom a geographic perspective, revenue increased in the Asia Pacific and China regions, partly offset by  declines in the EMEA and the Americas regions.\nThe gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased to 53.9% from 57.4% in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to an impairment of capital assets and higher restructuring costs for specific targeted actions under the new global restructuring programs in the fourth quarter of 2024. \nOperating cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $391 million compared to $779 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, a decrease of $388 million or 50.2% quarter-on-quarter. \n36\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the composition of operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n% of Revenue\n2023\n% of Revenue\nRevenue\n12,614 \n13,276 \n% nominal growth\n(5.0)\n0.5 \nGross profit\n7,119 \n7,553 \nGross margin\n56.4 \n%\n56.9 \n%\nResearch and development\n(2,347)\n18.6 \n%\n(2,418)\n18.2 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(1,164)\n9.2 \n%\n(1,159)\n8.7 \n%\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n(136)\n1.1 \n%\n(300)\n2.3 \n%\nOther income (expense)\n(55)\n0.4 \n%\n(15)\n0.1 \n%\nOperating income (loss)\n3,417 \n27.1 \n%\n3,661 \n27.6 \n%\nFinancial income (expense)\n(318)\n2.5 \n%\n(309)\n2.3 \n%\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n(545)\n4.3 \n%\n(523)\n3.9 \n%\nResults relating to equity-accounted investees\n(12)\n0.1 \n%\n(7)\n0.1 \n%\nNet income (loss)\n2,542 \n20.2 \n%\n2,822 \n21.3 \n%\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests\n32 \n0.3 \n%\n25 \n0.2 \n%\nNet income (loss) attributable to stockholders\n2,510 \n19.9 \n%\n2,797 \n21.1 \n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n9.73 \n10.70 \nRevenue \nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $12,614 million compared to $13,276 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $662 million or 5.0% year-on-year.  \n37\nRevenue by end market was as follows: \n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/(decrease)\n%\nAutomotive\n7,151 \n7,484 \n(333)\n(4.4)\n%\nIndustrial & IoT\n2,269 \n2,351 \n(82)\n(3.5)\n%\nMobile\n1,497 \n1,327 \n170 \n12.8 \n%\nCommunication Infrastructure & Other\n1,697 \n2,114 \n(417)\n(19.7)\n%\nRevenue\n12,614 \n13,276 \n(662)\n(5.0)\n%\nRevenue by sales channel was as follows: \n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/(decrease)\n%\nDistributors\n7,203 \n7,195 \n8 \n0.1 \n%\nOEM/EMS\n5,291 \n5,963 \n(672)\n(11.3)\n%\nOther\n120 \n118 \n2 \n1.7 \n%\nRevenue\n12,614 \n13,276 \n(662)\n(5.0)\n%\nRevenue by geographic region, which is based on the customer’s shipped-to location, was as follows: \n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/(decrease)\n%\nChina \n1)\n4,556 \n4,366 \n190 \n4.4 \n%\nAPAC, excluding China\n3,541 \n3,741 \n(200)\n(5.3)\n%\nEMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa)\n2,719 \n3,096 \n(377)\n(12.2)\n%\nAmericas\n1,798 \n2,073 \n(275)\n(13.3)\n%\nRevenue\n12,614 \n13,276 \n(662)\n(5.0)\n%\n1)\n China includes Mainland China and Hong Kong\nFrom an end market perspective, NXP experienced growth in its Mobile end market, which was offset by declines in the Communication Infrastructure & Other, Automotive and Industrial & IoT end markets versus the year ago period.\nRevenue in the Automotive end market was $7,151 million, a decrease of $333 million or 4.4% versus the year ago period, with processor and connectivity products contributing to the decline partly offset with growth in advanced analog and ADAS – Safety products.\nRevenue in the Industrial & IoT end market was $2,269 million, a decrease of $82 million or 3.5% versus the year ago period, with processor products contributing to the decline partly offset with growth in advanced analog and connectivity products.\nRevenue in the Mobile end market was $1,497 million, an increase of $170 million or 12.8% versus the year ago period, with mobile wallet products contributing to the growth.\nRevenue in the Communication Infrastructure & Other end market was $1,697 million, a decrease of $417 million or 19.7% versus the year ago period, with the entire product portfolio contributing the decline.\nWhen aggregating all end markets and reviewing sales channel performance, revenue through NXP’s third party distribution partners was $7,203 million, consistent with the year ago period with an increase of $8 million or 0.1%. Revenue through direct OEM and EMS customers was $5,291 million, a decrease of $672 million or 11.3% versus the year ago period.\nFrom a geographic perspective, revenue increased in the China region and declined in the EMEA, Americas, and Asia Pacific regions versus the year ago period.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $7,119 million, or 56.4% of revenue, compared to $7,553 million, or 56.9% of revenue, relatively consistent with revenue and costs, both of which had comparable decreases year on year, with 2024 experiencing a slightly lower year on year utilization.\n38\n \nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $3,647 million, or 28.9% of revenue, compared to $3,877 million, or 29.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n•\nResearch and development\nResearch and development (R&D) costs primarily consist of engineer salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), engineering related costs (including outside services, fixed-asset, IP and other licenses related costs), shared service center costs and other pre-production related expenses.\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n2023\n% change\nResearch and development\n2,347 \n$\n2,418 \n(2.9)\n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n18.6 \n%\n18.2 \n%\n0.4 \nppt\nR&D costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $71 million, or 2.9%, when compared to last year primarily driven by lower bonus of $85 million and higher received government assistance due to subsidies and R&D tax credits of $60 million, partly offset by higher engineer salaries and wages of $25 million, higher share-based compensation costs of $22 million and higher licensing fees of $12 million.\n•\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs primarily consist of personnel salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), communication and IT related costs, fixed-asset related costs and sales and marketing costs (including travel expenses). \n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n2023\n% change\nSelling, general and administrative\n1,164 \n$\n1,159 \n0.4 \n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n9.2 \n%\n8.7 \n%\n0.5 \nppt\nSG&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 remained relatively flat, an increase of $5 million, or 0.4%, when compared to last year primarily driven by higher personnel salaries and wages, including social securities of $32 million, higher share-based compensation costs of $23 million and higher restructuring costs for specific targeted actions under global restructuring programs of $11 million, offset by lower bonus of $43 million and lower legal expenses of $26 million. \n•\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n2023\n% change\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n136 \n300 \n(54.7)\n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n1.1 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n(1.2)\n ppt\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets decreased by $164 million, or 54.7%, when compared to last year mainly from the effect of certain acquisition-related intangibles becoming fully amortized (with regard to the previous Marvell and Freescale acquisitions). \nOther Income (Expense) \nOther income (expense) includes results from manufacturing service arrangements (“MSA”) and transitional service arrangements (“TSA”) that are put into place when we divest a business or activity, as well as other activity. These arrangements are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established. Other income (expense) reflects a loss of $55 million for 2024, compared to a loss of $15 million in 2023. Included in 2024 is a $40 million charge for a vacated deposit on an exited technology.\n39\nFinancial Income (Expense) \n($ in millions)\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nInterest income\n160 \n187 \nInterest expense\n(398)\n(438)\nTotal other financial income (expense)\n(80)\n(58)\nTotal\n(318)\n(309)\nFinancial income (expense) was an expense of $318 million in 2024, compared to an expense of $309 million in 2023. The change in financial income (expense) is attributable to a decrease in interest income of $27 million as a result of lower cash level in 2024, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased by $40 million as a result of redemption of debt. Other financial expenses increased due to adjustments in our investments as well as interest related to prior tax positions.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $545 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which reflects an effective tax rate of 17.6% compared to an expense of $523 million (15.6%) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nStatutory income tax in the Netherlands\n800 \n25.8 \n865 \n25.8 \nRate differential local statutory rates versus statutory rate of the Netherlands\n(71)\n(2.3)\n(77)\n(2.3)\nNet change in valuation allowance\n3 \n0.1 \n(3)\n(0.1)\nNon-deductible expenses/losses\n68 \n2.2 \n60 \n1.8 \nNetherlands tax incentives\n(112)\n(3.6)\n(111)\n(3.3)\nForeign tax incentives\n(214)\n(6.9)\n(251)\n(7.5)\nChanges in estimates of prior years’ income taxes\n12 \n0.4 \n(17)\n(0.5)\nWithholding taxes\n9 \n0.3 \n13 \n0.4 \nPillar 2 income taxes\n22 \n0.7 \n— \n— \nOther differences\n28 \n0.9 \n44 \n1.3 \nEffective tax rate\n545 \n17.6 \n523 \n15.6 \nThe effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives, a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the Netherlands statutory tax rate, changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes, change in valuation allowance non-deductible expenses and withholding taxes. The impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods, with the significant drivers outlined below: \n•\nThe Company benefits from certain tax incentives, which reduce the effective tax rate. The dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period. In 2024, the foreign tax incentives are lower compared to 2023 primarily due to less qualifying income.  \n•\nAs from 2024 a new alternative minimum tax law is applicable in The Netherlands, which is based on the OECD global anti-base erosion model rules (also known as Pillar Two). In accordance with this law, NXP N.V. recorded an additional tax expense in 2024.\n•\nThe higher favorable changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes in 2023 is primarily as a result of new guidance released by the Internal Revenue Service to clarify the treatment of specified research and experimental expenditures under Section 174. \n•\nThe other differences are mainly relating to excess tax benefits, unrecognized tax benefits, FX-effects and taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in the U.S. GILTI is recognized as a current period expense when incurred.\n40\nResults Relating to Equity-accounted Investees \nResults relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of $12 million in 2024, whereas in 2023 results relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of $7 million.  \nNon-controlling Interests \nNon-controlling interests are related to the third-party share in the results of consolidated companies, predominantly SSMC. Their share of non-controlling interests amounted to a profit of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a profit of $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \nWe derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations. We continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows, and we currently use cash to fund operations, meet working capital requirements, for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases, dividends and strategic investments. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our current available sources of funds (including cash and cash equivalents, RCF Agreement, Commercial Paper Program, EIB facilities, plus anticipated cash generated from operations) will be adequate to finance our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next year.\nCash and short-term deposits \nAs of December 31, 2024, our cash balance was $3,292 million, a decrease of $979 million compared to our cash balance and short-term deposits on December 31, 2023 ($4,271 million), of which $261 million (2023: $214 million) was held by SSMC, our consolidated joint venture company with TSMC. Under the terms of our joint venture agreement with TSMC, a portion of this cash can be distributed by way of a dividend to us, but 38.8% of the dividend will be paid to our joint venture partner. During 2024 and 2023, no dividend was declared. \nRevolving Credit Facility\nOur amended and restated Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) provides for $2,500 million of senior unsecured revolving credit commitments. We may borrow under this RCF in the future and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and any other purpose not prohibited by the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement and related documentation. As of December 31, 2024, we do not have any borrowings under the RCF.\nCommercial Paper Program\nUnder our Commercial Paper Program, we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes in amounts up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $2,000 million outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance and at a discount from par or at par and bear interest at rates determined at the time of issuance. We may issue notes in the future and use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no commercial paper notes outstanding. Subsequent to year-end and through date of this report, we issued commercial paper notes with a duration of up to 96 days at an principal amounts of $215 million. The weighted-average interest rate of the Company's outstanding commercial paper notes is 4.60%.\nEIB Facilities\nOur facility agreements with the European Investment Bank, (“EIB\") provide for an aggregate €1,000 million in unsecured senior loan facilities, the proceeds from which are expected to fund the research, development and innovation of semiconductor devices, technologies and solutions in five European countries. Borrowings on these facilities may be denominated in Euro or U.S. Dollar. See Financing Activities further below. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had a principal amount of $670 million outstanding under the EIB loan facilities with a maturity of December 2030 and a fixed annual interest rate of 4.45%. On February 11, 2025, we have provided notice to EIB that we will fully draw the remaining amounts under the EIB facility agreements, drawing on February 25, 2025, an additional total principal amount of $370 million with a fixed annual interest rate of 4.709% and a maturity of February 2031.\n41\nCapital return\nThe common stock repurchase activity was as follows: \n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\n2024\n2023\nShares repurchased\n5,726,770 \n5,460,135 \nCost of shares repurchased\n1,373 \n1,049 \nAverage price per share\n$239.74\n$192.16\nUnder Dutch corporate law and our articles of association, NXP may acquire its own shares if the general meeting of shareholders has granted the board of directors the authority to effect such acquisitions. It is our standard practice to request our annual general meeting of shareholders (the “AGM”) every year to renew this authorization for a period of 18 months from the AGM. For repurchases of shares in 2023 and 2024, the board of directors made use of the authorizations renewed by the AGM on June 1, 2022, May 24, 2023 and May 29, 2024, respectively. Our board of directors has approved the purchase of shares from participants in NXP's equity programs to satisfy participants' tax withholding obligations (\"trade for tax\") and this authorization will remain in effect until terminated by the board of directors. In March 2021, the board of directors approved the additional repurchase of shares up to a maximum of $2 billion (the \"2021 Share Repurchase Program\"), and in August 2021, the board of directors increased the 2021 Share Repurchase Program authorization by $2 billion, for a total of $4 billion approved for the repurchase of shares under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program. In January 2022, the board of directors approved the repurchase of additional shares up to a maximum of $2 billion (the \"2022 Share Repurchase Program\") and in August 2024, the Board approved the repurchase of additional shares up to a maximum of $2 billion  (the \"2024 Share Repurchase Program\"). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, NXP repurchased 5.5 million shares, for a total of approximately $1 billion under the trade for tax, 2021 and 2022 Share Repurchase Programs and during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, NXP repurchased 5.7 million shares, for a total of approximately $1.4 billion under the trade for tax and 2022 Share Repurchase Program. Under Dutch tax law, the repurchase of a company’s shares by an entity domiciled in the Netherlands results in a taxable event (unless exemptions apply). The tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders, with NXP making the payment on the shareholders’ behalf. As such, the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders’ equity.  \nSubject to Dutch corporate law and our articles of association, the board of directors of NXP may cancel shares acquired if authorized by the general meeting of shareholders. As with repurchases of our shares, it is our standard practice to request our annual general meeting of shareholders (the “AGM”) every year to renew this authorization for a period of 18 months from the AGM. The board of directors did not make use of the authorization during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\nUnder our Quarterly Dividend Program, interim dividends of $1.014 per ordinary share were paid on April 10, 2024 ($260 million), dividends of $1.014 per ordinary share were paid on July 10, 2024 ($259 million), dividends of $1.014 per ordinary share were paid on October 9, 2024 ($258 million) and dividends of $1.014 per ordinary share were paid on January 8, 2025 ($258 million). \n2024\n2023\nDividends declared (per share)\n4.056 \n4.056 \nDividends declared (in millions)\n1,035 \n1,048 \n42\nDebt\nOur total debt, inclusive of aggregate principal, unamortized discounts, premiums, debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments, amounted to $10,854 million as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $321 million compared to December 31, 2023 ($11,175 million).  \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $10,250 million (collectively the “Notes”), with $500 million payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $2,711 million, with $371 million payable within 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had an outstanding loan with the European Investment Bank (EIB) under the EIB Facility A, with a maturity date of December 9, 2030 for a principal amount of $670 million. Future interest payments associated with the EIB Facility A Loan total $179 million, with $30 million payable within 12 months.\nThe Company had a net debt position (see section Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures) at December 31, 2024 of $7,562 million compared to $6,904 million as of December 31, 2023. \nWe may from time to time continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. \nAdditional capital requirements\nWe believe our current positions in cash and cash equivalents, together with our expected cash flow generated from operations and our expected financing activities will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans. Recent and expected working and other capital requirements, in addition to the above matters, also include the items described below:\n•\nThe Company maintains purchase commitments with certain suppliers, primarily for raw materials, semi-finished goods and manufacturing services and for some non-production items. Purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary for different suppliers. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had purchase commitments, other than commitments directly with our foundry joint ventures, of $3,046 million, of which $936 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. We expect operating cash outflows to remain elevated as we make payments under these purchase agreements.\n•\nThe Company has committed to invest approximately $442 million in the newly founded ESMC GmbH, over the coming four years, of which approximately $102 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\n•\nDriven by our investment in VSMC, NXP has committed to invest an additional $1,460 million in equity through 2026, of which $1,072 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. NXP has also committed to contribute an additional $925 million to support the long-term capacity infrastructure that is expected to be paid through 2026, of which $634 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. In addition, NXP has an agreed purchase commitment with VSMC that over the lifetime of the factory the minimal loading will be between 80% - 90%, resulting in a total purchase commitment of approximately $14,242 million that is expected to be purchased over 37 years once wafer production starts.\n•\nAmounts related to future lease payments for operating lease obligations at December 31, 2024 totaled $321 million, with $62 million expected to be paid within the next 12 months.\n•\nThe Company enters into certain technology license arrangements which are used in conjunction with research and development activities for product development. Payments for these technology licenses are made over varying time periods. Outstanding unpaid balances for technology licenses total $325 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $85 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\n•\nCash outflows for capital expenditures were $727 million in 2024, compared to $827 million in 2023. We expect to reduce levels of capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in 2025, given our focus on investments in foundry partners while still supporting current and future manufacturing and production capacity needs.\n•\nOur research and development expenditures were $2,347 million in 2024 and $2,418 million in 2023, and we expect to maintain similar levels of investment in research and development as a percentage of revenue in 2025.\n43\n•\nThe Company has entered into definitive agreements to acquire in cash, Aviva Links ($242.5 million), TTTech Auto ($625 million) and Kinara, Inc. ($307 million), which are respectively expected to be paid within the next 12 months.\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to arrange for new debt and equity financing to fund the transaction. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or we may not have enough capacity under the RCF Agreement, EIB Facility Agreements, Commercial Paper Program, or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including outstanding commercial paper notes, and borrowings under the EIB Facility and RCF Agreements, the unsecured notes or to fund our other liquidity needs, including working capital and capital expenditure requirements. In any such case, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. See Part I, Item 1A.\n Risk Factors\n.\n2024 Financing Activities\nOn November 21, 2024, NXP B.V., NXP Funding and NXP USA entered into definitive documentation to establish an unsecured Commercial Paper Program (the “CP Program”) under which, on a joint and several basis, short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) may be issued. Amounts available under the CP Program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount of CP Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time not to exceed $2,000 million. The net proceeds of issuances of the CP Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.\nOn November 22, 2024, NXP B.V. entered into a facility agreement with the European Investment Bank, (“EIB Facility A”), which provides for a €640 million unsecured senior loan facility. The proceeds from borrowings under the EIB Facility A are expected to be used, together with proceeds from a second €360 million facility agreement (“EIB Facility B”) concluded in January 2025, to fund the research, development and innovation of semiconductor devices, technologies and solutions in five European countries. Borrowings on these facilities may be denominated in Euro or U.S. Dollar.\n2023 Financing Activities\nThere were no significant financing activities during 2023.\nCash flows\nOur cash and cash equivalents in 2024 decreased by $566 million (excluding the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash position of $(4) million) as follows:\n($ in millions)\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by (used for) operating activities\n2,782 \n3,513 \nNet cash (used for) provided by investing activities\n(686)\n(1,508)\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n(2,662)\n(1,990)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n(566)\n15 \n44\n•\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 our operating activities provided $2,782 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $2,542 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $1,151 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(923) million. Adjustments to net income include offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $925 million, share-based compensation of $461 million, a loss on equity securities of $18 million, results relating to equity-accounted investees of $12 million and changes in deferred taxes of $(272) million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a $222 million increase in inventories in order to align inventory on hand with expected demand, $207 million increase in receivables and other current assets due to the related timing of cash collection (driven primarily by distributors), $188 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of timing related to payments and lower purchases, and $306 million increase in other non-current assets due to payments to secure production supply with multiple vendors (driven primarily by payments of $275 million to support the long-term capacity infrastructure of VSMC).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 our operating activities provided $3,513 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $2,822 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $1,265 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(594) million. Adjustments to net income include offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $1,106 million, share-based compensation of $411 million, a gain on equity securities of $1 million, results relating to equity-accounted investees of $7 million and changes in deferred taxes of $(267) million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a $353 million increase in inventories due to improved supply capabilities, $138 million increase in receivables and other current assets from prepayments to secure production supply with multiple vendors, and $119 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of timing related to payments.\n•\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $686 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of $727 million, $149 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, and $260 million for the purchase of investments (driven primarily by the capital contributions of approximately $80 million into ESMC and approximately $140 million into VSMC); partially offset by the $409 million for the proceeds of short-term deposits and $30 million for the advance payment from sale of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1,508 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of $827 million, $409 investments in short-term deposits, $(179) million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, and $94 million for the purchase of investments.\n•\nCash Flow from Financing Activities  \nNet cash used for financing activities was $2,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This was primarily driven by the repurchase of long-term debt of $1,000 million, the dividend payment to common stockholders of $1,038 million, and purchase of treasury shares and restricted stock unit holdings of $1,373 million; partially offset by the $670 million proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and $82 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans.\nNet cash used for financing activities was $1,990 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by the dividend payment to common stockholders of $1,006 million, and purchase of treasury shares and restricted stock unit holdings of $1,053 million; partially offset by the $71 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans.\nInformation Regarding Guarantors of NXP (unaudited)\nSummarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nAll debt instruments are guaranteed, fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, by NXP Semiconductors N.V. and issued or guaranteed by NXP USA, Inc., NXP B.V. and NXP Funding LLC, (together, the “Subsidiary Obligors” and together with NXP Semiconductors N.V., the “Obligor Group”). Other than the Subsidiary Obligors, none of the Company’s subsidiaries (together the “Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”) guarantee the Notes. The Company \n45\nconsolidates the Subsidiary Obligors in its consolidated financial statements and each of the Subsidiary Obligors are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nAll of the existing guarantees by the Company rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of the Obligor Group. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Obligor Group to obtain funds from respective subsidiaries by dividend or loan.\n \nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Obligor Group on a combined basis, with intercompany balances and transactions between entities of the Obligor Group eliminated and investments and equity in the earnings of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries excluded. The Obligor Group’s amounts due from, amounts due to, and intercompany transactions with Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries have been disclosed below the table, when material.\nSummarized Statements of Income\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nRevenue\n7,207 \nGross Profit\n3,547 \nOperating income\n1,129 \nNet income\n310 \nSummarized Balance Sheets\nAs of\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nCurrent assets\n3,273 \nNon-current assets\n12,191 \nTotal assets\n15,464 \nCurrent liabilities\n1,244 \nNon-current liabilities\n10,967 \nTotal liabilities\n12,211 \nObligor's Group equity\n3,253 \nTotal liabilities and Obligor's Group equity\n15,464 \nNXP Semiconductors N.V. is the head of a fiscal unity for the corporate income tax and VAT that contains the most significant Dutch wholly-owned group companies. The Company is therefore jointly and severally liable for the tax liabilities of the tax entity as a whole, and as such the income tax expense of the Dutch fiscal unity has been included in the Net income of the Obligor Group.\nThe financial information of the Obligor Group includes sales executed through a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary single-billing entity as a sales agent on behalf of an entity in the Obligor Group. The Obligor Group has sales to non-guarantors (2024: $699 million). The Obligor Group has amounts due from equity financing (2024: $5,749 million) and due to debt financing (2024: $2,283 million) with non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nUse of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial information on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”), NXP also provides selected financial measures on a non-GAAP basis which are adjusted for specified items. The adjustments made to achieve these non-GAAP financial measures or the non-GAAP financial measures as specified are described below, including the usefulness to management and investors.\n46\nIn managing NXP’s business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In measuring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing our gross margin and operating margin and when assessing appropriate levels of research and development efforts. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company’s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting NXP’s business. We believe that they enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to core operating performance, certain non-cash expenses and share-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in NXP’s underlying performance. This information also enables investors to compare financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management.\nThe presentation of these and other similar items in NXP’s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Adjustment or Measure\nDefinition\nUsefulness to Management and Investors\nPurchase price accounting effects\nPurchase price accounting (\"PPA\") effects reflect the fair value adjustments impacting acquisition accounting and other acquisition adjustments charged to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. This typically relates to inventory, property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as developed technology and marketing and customer relationships acquired. The PPA effects are recorded within both cost of revenue and operating expenses in our US GAAP financial statements. These charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.\nWe believe that excluding these charges related to fair value adjustments for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures allows the users of our financial statements to better understand the historic and current cost of our products, our gross margin, our operating costs, our operating margin, and also facilitates comparisons to peer companies.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring charges are costs associated with a restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Charges related to restructuring are recorded within both cost of revenue and operating expenses in our US GAAP financial statements\nWe exclude restructuring charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.\nShare-based compensation\nShare-based compensation consists of incentive expense granted to eligible employees in the form of equity based instruments. Charges related to share-based compensation are recorded within both cost of revenue and operating expenses in our US GAAP financial statements.\nWe exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these charges, which are non-cash, are not representative of our core operating performance as they can fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends.\nOther incidentals\nOther incidentals consist of certain items which may be non-recurring, unusual, infrequent or directly related to an event that is distinct and non-reflective of the Company’s core operating performance. These may include such items as process and product transfer costs, certain charges related to acquisitions and divestitures, litigation and legal settlements, costs associated with the exit of a product line, factory or facility, environmental or governmental settlements, and other items of similar nature.\nWe exclude these certain items which may be non-recurring, unusual, infrequent or directly related to an event that is distinct and non-reflective of the Company’s core operating performance for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.\n47\nNon-GAAP Adjustment or Measure\nDefinition\nUsefulness to Management and Investors\nNon-GAAP Provision for income taxes\nNon-GAAP provision for income taxes is NXP's GAAP provision for income taxes adjusted for the income tax effects of the adjustments to our GAAP measure, including the effects of purchase price accounting (“PPA”), restructuring costs, share-based compensation, other incidental items and certain other adjustments to financial income (expense) items. Additionally, adjustments are made for the income tax effect of any discrete items that occur in the interim period. Discrete items primarily relate to unexpected tax events that may occur as these amounts cannot be forecasted (e.g., the impact of changes in tax law and/or rates, changes in estimates or resolved tax audits relating to prior year tax provisions, the excess or deficit tax effects on share-based compensation, etc.).\nThe non-GAAP provision for income taxes is used to ascertain and present on a comparable basis NXP's provision for income tax after adjustments, the usefulness of which is described within this table. Additionally, the income tax effects of the adjustments to achieve the noted non-GAAP measures are used to determine NXP's non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to stockholders and accordingly, our diluted non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to stockholders.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow represents operating cash flow adjusted for net additions to property, plant and equipment.\nWe believe that free cash flow provides insight into our cash-generating capability and our financial performance, and is an efficient means by which users of our financial statements can evaluate our cash flow after meeting our capital expenditure.\nNet debt\nNet debt represents total debt (short-term and long-term) after deduction of cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits.\nWe believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect of calculating our net leverage.\n48\nThe following are reconciliations of our most comparable US GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:\n($ in millions)\nThree months ended\nFull-year\nDecember 31, 2024\nSeptember 29, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n2024\n2023\nGAAP gross profit\n$\n1,678\n \n$\n1,866\n \n$\n1,937\n \n$\n7,119\n \n$\n7,553\n \nPPA effects\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n(47)\n(53)\nRestructuring\n(21)\n— \n(13)\n(28)\n(11)\nShare-based compensation\n(15)\n(14)\n(14)\n(59)\n(54)\nOther incidentals\n(64)\n— \n(33)\n(79)\n(91)\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n1,789\n \n$\n1,892\n \n$\n2,010\n \n$\n7,332\n \n$\n7,762\n \nGAAP Gross Margin\n53.9\n \n%\n57.4\n \n%\n56.6\n \n%\n56.4\n \n%\n56.9\n \n%\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\n57.5\n \n%\n58.2\n \n%\n58.7\n \n%\n58.1\n \n%\n58.5\n \n%\nGAAP research and development\n$\n(612)\n$\n(577)\n$\n(651)\n$\n(2,347)\n$\n(2,418)\nRestructuring\n(50)\n— \n(49)\n(57)\n(59)\nShare-based compensation\n(60)\n(58)\n(55)\n(234)\n(211)\nOther incidentals\n(5)\n— \n(1)\n(6)\n(5)\nNon-GAAP research and development\n$\n(497)\n$\n(519)\n$\n(546)\n$\n(2,050)\n$\n(2,143)\nGAAP selling, general and administrative\n$\n(323)\n$\n(265)\n$\n(311)\n$\n(1,164)\n$\n(1,159)\nPPA effects\n— \n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nRestructuring\n(41)\n— \n(22)\n(40)\n(28)\nShare-based compensation\n(42)\n(43)\n(38)\n(168)\n(146)\nOther incidentals\n(12)\n(2)\n(5)\n(45)\n(32)\nNon-GAAP selling, general and administrative\n$\n(228)\n$\n(219)\n$\n(245)\n$\n(909)\n$\n(950)\nGAAP operating income (loss)\n$\n675\n \n$\n990\n \n$\n907\n \n$\n3,417\n \n$\n3,661\n \nPPA effects\n(39)\n(42)\n(77)\n(185)\n(356)\nRestructuring\n(112)\n— \n(84)\n(125)\n(98)\nShare-based compensation\n(117)\n(115)\n(107)\n(461)\n(411)\nOther incidentals\n(122)\n(6)\n(44)\n(181)\n(136)\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss)\n$\n1,065\n \n$\n1,153\n \n$\n1,219\n \n$\n4,369\n \n$\n4,662\n \nGAAP Operating Margin\n21.7\n \n%\n30.5\n \n%\n26.5\n \n%\n27.1\n \n%\n27.6\n \n%\nNon-GAAP Operating Margin\n34.2\n \n%\n35.5\n \n%\n35.6\n \n%\n34.6\n \n%\n35.1\n \n%\nGAAP Income tax benefit (provision)\n$\n(77)\n$\n(173)\n$\n(124)\n$\n(545)\n$\n(523)\nIncome tax effect\n87 \n9 \n54 \n141 \n170 \nNon-GAAP Income tax benefit (provision)\n$\n(164)\n$\n(182)\n$\n(178)\n$\n(686)\n$\n(693)\n($ in millions)\nThree months ended\nFull-year\nDecember 31, 2024\nSeptember 29, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by (used for) operating activities \n$\n391\n \n$\n779\n \n$\n1,137\n \n$\n2,782\n \n$\n3,513\n \nNet capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment\n(99)\n(186)\n(175)\n(693)\n(826)\nNon-GAAP free cash flow\n$\n292\n \n$\n593\n \n$\n962\n \n$\n2,089\n \n$\n2,687\n \n49\n($ in millions)\nThree months ended\nFull-year\nDecember 31, 2024\nSeptember 29, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n2024\n2023\nLong-term debt\n$\n10,354 \n$\n9,683 \n$\n10,175 \n$\n10,354 \n$\n10,175 \nShort-term debt\n500 \n499 \n1,000 \n500 \n1,000 \nTotal debt\n10,854 \n10,182 \n11,175 \n10,854 \n11,175 \nLess: cash and cash equivalents\n(3,292)\n(2,748)\n(3,862)\n(3,292)\n(3,862)\nLess: short-term deposits\n— \n(400)\n(409)\n— \n(409)\nNet debt\n$\n7,562\n \n$\n7,034\n \n$\n6,904\n \n$\n7,562\n \n$\n6,904\n \nCritical Accounting Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and based on information available when the estimates were made. In the following section, we discuss our most critical accounting estimates and the judgments involved.\n \nInventories\nWe regularly review our inventories and write down our inventories for estimated losses due to obsolescence. This allowance is determined for groups of products based on sales of our products in the recent past and/or projected future demand. Future demand is affected by market conditions, technological obsolescence, new products and strategic plans, each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning. \nGoodwill\nGoodwill is required to be assessed for impairment at least once annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill. Such events or changes in circumstances can include significant changes in business climate, operating performance or competition, or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. We perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions. We base our fair-value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing.\nImpairment or disposal of identified long-lived assets\nWe perform reviews of long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than what we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Impairment losses, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\n50\nThe assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. Future values include estimates of future cash flows and estimates of fair value. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. \nRevenue recognition \nIn determining the transaction price of contracts with customers, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts, price protection, product returns and distributor incentive programs. The estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors, including contractual terms, analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments. \nFor some sales to distributors, contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met. These return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized. However, long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned. For sales where return rights exist, the Company has determined, based on historical data, that only a small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned. Sales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities. These programs may include credits granted to distributors, or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory. In determining the transaction price, the Company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized. The Company’s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates, as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels. The estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity. Historically, actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed. \nIncome taxes\nThe application of tax laws and regulations to calculate our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. For each jurisdiction, we recognize a tax liability and/or asset based on our best estimate of these technical merits.",
