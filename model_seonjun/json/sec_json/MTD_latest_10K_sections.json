We are a leading global provider of metal detectors,      x-ray systems, checkweighers, and camera-based imaging equipment that are used in these industries. Metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself. X-ray inspection is used to detect metallic contamination in applications unsuited to metal detectors and many types of non-metallic contamination, such as glass, calcified bone, stones, and pits. Our x-ray systems are also used for mass control and for determining and controlling the fat content in meat. Checkweighers are used to control the filled weight of packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Our camera-based vision inspection solutions provide in-line inspection of package quality, labels, and content, which are needs for food and beverage, consumer goods, and pharmaceutical companies.\nAll of our technologies are integrated with material handling systems to ensure the correct presentation of the customer’s product to the device and the secure rejection of non-conforming product, and are frequently designed to comply with stringent hygiene standards. Our technologies may also be used together as components of integrated packaging lines. ProdX Inspect is our quality and productivity control software for helping customers comply with regulations and optimize process efficiency, either as a stand-alone solution or through integration with the customer’s manufacturing and enterprise systems.\nRetail Weighing Solutions\nSupermarkets, hypermarkets, and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits, or cheeses). We offer weighing and software solutions, which can integrate counter, self-service, backroom, and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management system. In addition, we offer weighing solutions for fast-growing areas like self-checkout and unmanned stores, as well as AI-driven image recognition solutions for fresh goods. The customer benefits of our retail solutions are in the areas of enterprise-wide device management as well as article and price management, merchandising, and regulatory compliance. In North America and select other markets, our offering also includes automated packaging and labeling solutions for the meat backroom, which are fully integrated with the scales in the store. The retail business accounted for approximately 5% of our net sales in 2024, 6% in 2023, and 5% in 2022.\n7\nTable of Contents\nCustomers and Distribution\nOur principal customers include companies in the following key end-markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and biotech companies, as well as independent research organizations and testing labs); food manufacturers; chemical, specialty chemicals, and cosmetics companies; the academic community; food retailers; the transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; and the electronics industry.\nOur products are sold through a variety of distribution channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated through indirect channels, including sales of our Ohaus-branded products. Ohaus-branded products target markets, such as the educational market, in which customers are interested in lower cost, a more limited set of features, and less comprehensive support and service.\nWe have a diversified customer base, with no single end-customer accounting for more than 1% of 2024 net sales.\nSales and Service\nMarket Organizations\nWe maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service. The market organizations are customer-focused, with an emphasis on building and maintaining value-added relationships with customers in our target market segments. Each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations (described below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives, new product and application ideas, and information about key market segments.\nWe have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we compete against. At December 31, 2024, our sales and service group consisted of approximately 9,000 employees in sales, marketing and customer service (including related administration), and post-sales technical service, located in approximately 40 countries. This field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach.\nService\nOur service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services, as well as further expanding our offerings to provide value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance, performance enhancements, application expertise and training, and remote services. We have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with FDA and other international regulations, and we can provide these services to most customers’ locations around the world. Our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world. Service (representing service contracts, on-demand services, and replacement parts) accounted for approximately 24% of our net sales in 2024, 23% in 2023, and 20% in 2022.\n8\nTable of Contents\nBeyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers, which provides us with high-quality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas.\nResearch and Development and Manufacturing\nProducing Organizations\nOur research, product development, and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs, improve customer focus, and maintain technological leadership. The producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations. We also have regional logistics hubs to satisfy customer delivery requirements while optimizing our logistics processes.\nResearch and Development\nWe continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications. Over the last three years, we have invested $551 million in research and development ($189 million in 2024, $185 million in 2023, and $177 million in 2022), which is approximately 5% of net sales for each year. Our research and development efforts fall into three categories:\n•\ntechnology advancements, which generate new products or features and increase the value of our products. These advancements may be in the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for our technologies, more accurate or reliable measurement, additional software capability, or automation through robotics or other means.\n•\napplications development to complement our products and provide complete solutions to our customers.\n•\ncost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design and/or improve the ease of serviceability.\nWe devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development. This includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments, application-specific software, and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems. We closely integrate research and development with marketing, manufacturing, and product engineering. We have approximately 1,600 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe.\nManufacturing\nWe are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally located in China, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations, and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process. All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001 certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand. \nWe generally manufacture critical components, which are components that contain proprietary technology. When outside manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other manufacturers for certain non-proprietary components. We use a wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of \n9\nTable of Contents\nmaterials. From time to time, we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally.\nBacklog; Seasonality\nOur manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically not longer than one to two months.\nOur business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than, sales in the second and third quarters. Prior to 2023, fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 27% to 30% of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater effect on earnings before taxes than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters. Quarterly seasonality in 2023 and 2024 was impacted by shipping delays at our European Logistics facility in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was recovered in the first quarter of 2024.\nEmployees\nOur total global workforce was approximately 17,300, consisting of 16,000 employees and 1,300 temporary personnel, as of December 31, 2024, and includes approximately 6,200 in Europe, 4,800 in North and South America, and 6,300 in Asia and other countries. \nWe are proud of our corporate culture and our talented employees. We endeavor to continue to provide an attractive work environment and keep our employees fully engaged. We know that our future success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining the best employees. We promote equal opportunity and inclusiveness worldwide and value diversity in our global workforce, which reflects the diversity in the many communities in which we operate internationally. We employ people of more than 100 nationalities. \nWe promote diversity and we encourage all employees, inclusive of all our demographics, to take on more responsibilities and management positions. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 36% of our global employee headcount was female, with approximately 29% holding management positions. We place great emphasis on performance management, training, and developing our employees across all levels and regions. During 2024, approximately 93% of employees completed one or more training courses, including part-time and temporary personnel. Lastly, we have local safety programs in place in all relevant units, and select locations have implemented a certified work safety management system. Severe workplace accidents are rare and there has been one fatality from an occupational incident related to a motor vehicle accident in the past five years.\nWe believe our employee relations are good, and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years. Approximately 8,000 employees are represented by collective bargaining or another arrangement organized to represent employee interests.\nSustainability\nSustainability touches all aspects of our business, from designing, sourcing, and producing our products, to selling and delivering them to our customers, to handling them at the end of their lifecycle. A sustainable mindset helps guide us to make the right decisions for our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate our business. We want to manage our business sustainably to position the Company for long-term growth. More than 15 years ago, we launched our GreenMT program to pursue environmental, social, and governance priorities where we can have a significant positive impact. We do this in five key areas: (1) keeping our operations sustainable over the \n10\nTable of Contents\nlong term by ensuring we use resources efficiently, (2) helping our customers to be sustainable in their businesses by offering sustainable products and services, (3) promoting responsible practices within our supply chain, (4) ensuring an engaged workforce through fair, attractive, safe, and development-minded workplaces (see Employees section above), and (5) following corporate governance best practices. \nWe have set a number of goals relating to our GreenMT sustainability program, including reducing our carbon footprint and other environmental, social, and governance goals. As an example, as of 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality with respect to Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\n2\n emissions by realizing efficiency improvements, sourcing 100% renewable electricity for all our operations, and using offsets. We also have goals relating to waste, including reducing our waste intensity by 20% and achieving zero waste to landfill, in each case by 2025. Furthermore, we are committed to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Our commitment includes near-term and long-term net-zero targets approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). As a further example, we pursue several goals related to supply chain transparency including risk assessments and targeted supplier audits. We report annually on our progress related to sustainability topics in our Corporate Responsibility Report, available on www.mt.com/sustainability. \nBlue Ocean Program\nBlue Ocean refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized, automated, and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency. It encompasses an enterprise architecture, with a global, single-instance ERP system. Within our IT systems, we continue to move toward integrated, homogeneous applications and common data structures. We also are largely standardizing our key business processes. The implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi-year period. We have implemented the Blue Ocean program in our operations in the U.S., China, most of Asia Pacific, and most of Europe. We estimate that we have more than 90% of our users on the program, and we will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years.\nIntellectual Property\nWe hold over 5,400 patents and trademarks (including pending applications), primarily in the United States, Switzerland, China, the European Union, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and India. Our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are protected by patents of various durations. Products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our business. We regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property.\nRegulation\nOur products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations.\nApprovals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the European Union.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.\nIn addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCompetition\nOur markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets.\nWe expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track record of technological innovation; our comprehensive, high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service offering; our large installed base of instruments; and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region, product range, application, and customer. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying, developing, and maintaining any competitive advantages.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself, application support, service support, and price. In emerging markets, where there is greater \n12\nTable of Contents\ndemand for less sophisticated products, price is a more important factor than in developed markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well.\nCompany Website and Information\nYou can find our website on the internet at \nwww.mt.com\n.

  "item7": "Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates. We believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results.\nWe also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region, product range, and customer. We hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors, including the strength of our brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions, our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network.\nNet sales in U.S. dollars increased 2% in 2024 and decreased 3% in 2023. Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales increased 3% in 2024 and decreased 3% in 2023. Net sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by approximately $58 million from our previously disclosed shipping delays related to a new external European logistics service provider, which were largely recovered in the first quarter of 2024. We estimate local currency net sales were flat in 2024 and decreased 1% in 2023 excluding the impact of the delayed shipments. Market demand in our core segments was soft in 2024, particularly in China. We continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions, diversified customer base, innovative product offering, investment in emerging markets, significant installed base, and the impact of our sophisticated global sales and marketing programs. Examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities, more effectively pricing our products and services, increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and redirecting resources to our most promising growth opportunities, increasing the use of digital tools, and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes. \nIn addition to soft market demand during 2024, we also continued to experience uncertainty in the economic environment, including the risk of recession in many countries, and unfavorable foreign currency. Our team’s resilience and agility, and our productivity and cost savings initiatives, were critical to our ability to mitigate these challenges. Over the past few years, we also accelerated our ability to use advanced analytics to identify and pursue growth opportunities, while increasing the effectiveness of our digital tools to support our global sales organization. We also have continued to increase engagement with our customers with our Go-to-Market and digital approaches. Our market-leading solutions and ability to leverage our innovative portfolio have also allowed us to quickly capitalize on our customers' demand for automation and digitalization solutions and faster growing segments. We are well positioned, and have continued to make investments to further strengthen our portfolio and capture future growth opportunities. Our service business also delivered very strong results in 2024 as we have been able to support our customers’ ability to maintain uptime, improve productivity, and comply with regulatory requirements.\nAs we enter 2025, we expect to continue to benefit from market trends toward automation and digitalization, as well as customer investments in on/near-shoring activities. However, many of our end-markets, including pharma/biopharmaceutical, food, and chemical, remain challenged after significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, market conditions and challenges remain uncertain relating to the macro environment and global economy, including the impacts of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and increasing geopolitical tensions. Market conditions also may change quickly. \nOur laboratory sales grew in 2024 despite a decrease in China as the sharp market decline in 2023 continued during 2024. We believe we will benefit from favorable pharma/biopharma market trends in the future. We also believe we will continue to benefit from increased customer demand for automation, digitalization, and safety; new facility investments; and continued focus on regulatory compliance including data integrity requirements. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our laboratory business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur industrial sales grew modestly in 2024 despite challenging market conditions for core industrial in China. We continue to benefit from our strong product offering and focus on the more attractive, faster-growing segments of the market and strong execution of our growth initiatives in each region.\n \nWe also continue to benefit from market trends in automation and digitalization and also expect to benefit from customer on/near-shoring activities in the future. Our core industrial-related products are also especially sensitive to changes in economic growth. China and emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies, and we expect this to also be a source of long-term growth. Product inspection experienced solid growth in 2024, and we expect our product inspection end-market to continue to benefit from our customers’ focus on brand protection, food safety, and productivity.\nOur food retailing sales decreased significantly during 2024 primarily due to strong project activity in 2023, especially in the Americas. Traditionally, the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other end-markets due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations.  \nIn 2025, we will continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:\nGaining Market Share. \nInnovation is essential to gaining market share and is fundamental in all aspects of our business including sales and marketing and technology leadership\n. \nOur global sales and marketing initiative, Spinnaker, continues to be an important growth strategy. We aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs, leveraging our extensive customer databases, product offering, and installed base. While this initiative is broad-based, efforts to improve these processes include the use of advanced data analytics to identify, prioritize, and pursue growth opportunities; the implementation of more effective pricing related to value-based selling strategies and processes; improved sales force guidance, training, and effectiveness; cross-selling; increased segment marketing; and leads generation and nurturing activities. We also have added resources to pursue under-penetrated market opportunities and continue to adapt our Go-to-Market approaches with additional inside and telesales resources, while also increasing digital customer interaction. We continue to benefit from digitalization tools to gain efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of our field sales force. \nIn addition, our comprehensive service offerings, and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings, help us further penetrate developed markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world, and we continue to leverage advanced data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities to increase the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract, or sell new products that replace old products in our installed base. In addition to traditional repair and maintenance, our service offerings continue to expand into value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance. We have also improved our service model to incorporate remote service, depot drop-off/pickup, and other approaches. \nFaster-Growing Markets.\n Emerging markets, comprising Asia (excluding Japan), Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, account for approximately 34% of our total net sales of which 16% relates to China. We have a two-pronged strategy in emerging markets: first, to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in these markets, and second, to leverage our low-cost manufacturing operations in China. We have more than a 35-year track record in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more than 10% on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999. Over the years, we also have broadened our product offering to the Asian markets. India has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities. Overall, versus the prior year, we experienced a 1% decrease in emerging market local currency sales by destination during 2024, which included an 11% local currency sales decline in China and a 10% local currency sales increase in other emerging markets. Following particularly strong growth in 2022 and 2021, market conditions in \n36\nTable of Contents\nChina declined significantly during the second half of 2023, and challenging market conditions persisted in 2024. Going forward, we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to pharma, food manufacturing, chemical, and new energy. We believe the long-term growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the Chinese government’s emphasis on science, high-value industries, product quality, and food safety. We expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from our focus on these segments. We also continue to pursue growth in under-penetrated emerging markets. However, emerging market sales can be volatile as we experienced in China over the past several years. China has historically been volatile, and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors. In addition to China and emerging markets, we also pursue other faster-growth vertical markets. While rather small, these markets present outsized growth potential. Segments include semiconductors, advanced materials, and new energy. The components of these faster-growing segments will change as various markets develop, and we will continue to leverage the breadth and scope of our product offering as new opportunities emerge. \nExtending Our Technology Lead.\n We continue to focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent approximately 5% of net sales on research and development, reflecting a total of $551 million. We seek to improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software, which we believe supports our pricing differentiation and accelerates product replacement cycles. In addition, we aim to create value for our customers by having thorough knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base.\nExpanding Our Margins. \nWe continue to strive to improve our margins by enhancing our value proposition via innovation, more effectively pricing our products and services, optimizing our cost structure, and improving our mix in higher-margin businesses such as service. For example, sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes. We have also implemented productivity and cost savings initiatives over the past two years to mitigate our reduced volume, while also focusing on reallocating resources to better align our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives, higher-growth/profitable areas, and opportunities for margin improvement. \nWe also have implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering costs and have increased our focus on these programs with our SternDrive initiative. SternDrive is our global operational excellence program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain, manufacturing, and back-office operations. Blue Ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives. Our move to standardized business processes, systems, and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to real-time data. Our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as reducing our working capital levels, improving our order to cash cycle, and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures. \nPursuing Strategic Acquisitions.\n We seek to pursue \"bolt-on\" acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels, and technological leadership. We have identified life sciences and process analytics as key areas for acquisitions. For example, in 2021, we acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications. PendoTECH serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the United States. In 2021, we also acquired Scale-up Systems Inc., a leading software provider for scale-up and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets.\n37\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations — Consolidated\nNet sales\nNet sales were $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.8 billion in 2023 and $3.9 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of 2% in 2024 and a decrease of 3% in 2023 in U.S. dollars and an increase of 3% in 2024 and a decrease of 3% in 2023 in local currencies. Net sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by approximately $58 million from our previously disclosed shipping delays related to a new external European logistics service provider, which were largely recovered in the first quarter of 2024. We estimate local currency net sales were flat in 2024 and decreased approximately 1% in 2023 excluding the impact of the delayed shipments. In 2024, we experienced soft market demand, particularly in China. We continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs, our innovative product portfolio, and investments in our field organization, particularly surrounding digital tools and techniques. However, there continues to be uncertainty in our end-markets, the economic environment and geopolitics, and market conditions may change quickly.\nIn 2024, our net sales by geographic destination increased in U.S. dollars compared to 2023 by 8% in Europe, 2% in the Americas, and decreased by 3% in Asia/Rest of World. In local currencies, our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2024 by 8% in Europe, 3% in the Americas, and decreased by 1% in Asia/Rest of World, with an 11% decline in China. A discussion of sales by operating segment is included below. \nAs described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services, including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, preventative maintenance, and spare parts.\nNet sales of products increased 1% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies during 2024 and decreased 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currencies in 2023. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased 7% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2024 and increased 10% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2023.\nNet sales of our laboratory products and services, which represented approximately 56% of our total net sales in 2024, increased 6% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies during 2024. Laboratory net sales in 2024 benefited approximately 4% and were reduced by 2% in 2023 from the previously disclosed shipping delays. The local currency increase in net sales of our laboratory-related products during 2024 includes an increase in most product categories, especially analytical instruments. Laboratory results were also negatively impacted by a decline in China. \nNet sales of our industrial products and services, which represented approximately 39% of our total net sales in 2024, were flat in U.S. dollars and increased 1% in local currencies during 2024. Industrial net sales in 2024 benefited approximately 1% and were reduced by 1% in 2023 from the previously disclosed shipping delays. The local currency increase in net sales of our industrial-related products during 2024 includes solid growth in product inspection, offset in part by a decline in core-industrial products, especially in China.\nNet sales of our food retailing products and services, which represented approximately 5% of our total net sales in 2024, decreased 14% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies during 2024. Retail net sales in 2024 benefited approximately 3% and were reduced by 2% in 2023 from previously disclosed shipping delays. The local currency decrease in net sales of our food retailing products during 2024 related to particularly strong project activity in 2023, especially in the Americas.\n38\nTable of Contents\nGross profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.1% for 2024, 59.2% for 2023, and 58.9% for 2022.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 62.1% for 2024, compared to 60.6% for both 2023 and 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including spare parts) was 53.7% for 2024, compared to 54.3% for 2023 and 52.0% for 2022.\nThe gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2024 primarily reflects favorable price realization that benefits from our innovative product portfolio, benefits from our productivity, and cost savings initiatives and business mix, offset in part by investments in our service organization. \nResearch and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.9% for 2024, compared to 4.9% for 2023, and 4.5% for 2022. Research and development expenses in U.S. dollars increased 2% in 2024 and 5% in 2023, and in local currencies increased 2% in 2024 and 3% in 2023.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 24.2% for 2024, compared to 23.9% for both 2023 and 2022. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 4% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2024 and decreased 4% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2023. The increase during 2024 primarily includes higher variable compensation, offset in part by benefits from our cost savings initiatives.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense was $72.9 million in 2024, compared to $72.2 million and $66.2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in amortization expense during 2024 relates to our investments in information technology, primarily from our Blue Ocean program.\nRestructuring charges\nDuring the past few years, we initiated various cost reduction measures. Restructuring charges were  $19.8 million in 2024, compared to $32.7 million and $9.6 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of employee-related costs.\nOther charges (income), net\nOther charges (income), net consisted of net income of $4.6 million, $4.1 million, and $9.3 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Other charges (income), net includes non-service pension costs (benefits), net (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities, interest income, and other items. Non-service pension benefits were $7.7 million, $7.6 million, and $16.9 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Other charges (income), net also includes acquisition costs, for which there were $0.3 million in 2024 and $0.9 million in 2022.\nInterest expense and taxes\nInterest expense was $74.6 million in 2024, compared to $77.4 million in 2023 and $55.4 million in\n \n2022. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to lower debt levels throughout the year.\nOur reported tax rate was 16.8% in 2024, compared to 19.0% and 18.5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The reported tax rate in 2024 includes a non-cash discrete tax benefit of $23 million resulting from the reduction of uncertain tax position liabilities related to the settlement of a tax audit. \n39\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations — by Operating Segment\nThe following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments.

The increase in local currency growth in net sales to external customers during 2024 includes strong growth in most product categories.\nSegment profit increased $17.9 million in our Other Operations segment during 2024, compared to an increase of $15.9 million during 2023. The increase in segment profit during 2024 primarily relates to increased sales volume and our margin expansion initiatives, offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency translation. \nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Future Cash Requirements\nLiquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations and commitments.   Sources of liquidity include cash flows from operating activities, available borrowings under our Credit Agreement, the ability to obtain appropriate financing, and our cash and cash equivalent balances. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and acquisitions. Global market conditions can be uncertain, and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets.\nWe currently believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement, local working capital facilities, and cash balances, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future.\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $968.3 million in 2024, compared to $965.9 million in 2023 and $859.1 million in 2022. The increase in 2024 is primarily related to favorable working capital, including lower cash incentive payments of $35 million.\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment, and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled $103.9 million in 2024, $105.3 million in 2023, and $121.2 million in 2022. Capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to be relatively consistent with previous years subject to business and economic conditions.\nIn September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. We received the maximum allowable funding of $35.8 million related to the agreement during prior years, which offset associated capital expenditures.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, we incurred acquisition payments totaling $10.1 million, $5.8 million, and $38.0 million, respectively. In addition, the Company paid $10.0 million for contingent consideration relating to the PendoTECH acquisition in both 2023 and 2022. In 2022, $7.9 million is included in financing activities and $2.1 million is included in operating activities for the amount not accrued at the acquisition date on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In 2023, the final contingent consideration payment was made of which $5.6 million is included in financing activities for the amount accrued at the acquisition date and $4.4 million is included in operating activities for the amount not accrued at the acquisition date on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nCash flows used in financing activities during 2024 primarily comprised share repurchases. In accordance with our share repurchase program, we spent $850.0 million in 2024 and $900.0 million and $1.1 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, on the repurchase of 645,139 shares, 691,913 shares, and 838,010 shares, respectively. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares; however, in 2025, we intend to spend approximately $875 million on the repurchase of shares, subject to business and economic conditions.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted in August, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income. The financial impact of the IRA is immaterial to our financial statements. \nWe plan to continue to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes. All other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. We believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity.\n43\nTable of Contents\nSenior Notes and Credit Facility Agreement\nOur short-term borrowings and long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31, 2024:\nU.S. Dollar\nOther Principal\nTrading Currencies\nTotal\n4.24% $125 million 10-year Senior Notes due June 25, 2025\n125,000 \n— \n125,000 \n3.91% $75 million 10-year Senior Notes due June 25, 2029\n75,000 \n— \n75,000 \n5.45% $150 million 10-year Senior Notes due March 1, 2033\n150,000 \n— \n150,000 \n2.83% $125 million 12-year Senior Notes due July 22, 2033\n125,000 \n— \n125,000 \n3.19% $50 million 15-year Senior Notes due January 24, 2035\n50,000 \n— \n50,000 \n2.81% $150 million 15-year Senior Notes due March 17, 2037\n150,000 \n— \n150,000 \n2.91% $150 million 15-year Senior Notes due September 1, 2037\n150,000 \n— \n150,000 \n1.47% EUR 125 million 15-year Senior Notes due June 17, 2030\n— \n129,840 \n129,840 \n1.30% EUR 135 million 15-year Senior Notes due November 6, 2034\n— \n140,227 \n140,227 \n1.06% EUR 125 million 15-year Senior Notes due March 19, 2036\n— \n129,840 \n129,840 \nSenior Notes debt issuance costs, net\n(2,335)\n(1,925)\n(4,260)\nTotal Senior Notes\n822,665 \n397,982 \n1,220,647 \n$1.35 billion Credit Agreement, interest at benchmark plus 87.5 basis points\n(1)(2)\n445,706 \n284,497 \n730,203 \nOther local arrangements\n6,392 \n56,646 \n63,038 \nTotal debt\n1,274,763 \n739,125 \n2,013,888 \nLess: current portion\n(126,200)\n(56,423)\n(182,623)\nTotal long-term debt\n$\n1,148,563 \n$\n682,702 \n$\n1,831,265 \n(1) See Note 6 and Note 7 for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the Credit Agreement.\n(2) The benchmark interest rate is determined by the borrowing currency. The benchmark rates by borrowing currency are as follows: SOFR for U.S. dollars (plus a 10 basis points spread adjustment), SARON for Swiss franc, EURIBOR for euro and SONIA for Great British pounds\n. \nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $615.3 million of additional borrowings were available under our Credit Agreement and we maintained $59.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2024, the interest payments associated with 73% of the Company’s debt are fixed obligations. We expect to make interest payments of approximately $72.0 million during 2025 associated with our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\nChanges in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. Further, we do not have any downgrade triggers from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2024. \nSenior Notes\nThe Senior Notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants as further described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2025, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell EUR 100 million 10 1/2-year Senior Notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.80% (3.8% Euro Senior Notes) in a private placement, which will \n44\nTable of Contents\nmature in July 2035. We used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nIn December 2022, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $150 million 10-year Senior Notes in a private placement. We issued $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.45% (5.45% Senior Notes) in March 2023, which will mature in March 2033. We used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nCredit Agreement\nOn May 30, 2024, we entered into a $1.35 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended our $1.25 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement), which is further described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Local Arrangements\nIn April 2018, two of our non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions, which include an interest rate of SARON plus 87.5 basis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company has $1.7 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program as of December 31, 2024. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors. \nWe have purchased 32.4 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through December 31, 2024, at a total cost of $9.8 billion and average price per share of $302.60. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we spent $850.0 million and $900 million on the repurchase of 645,139 shares and 691,913 shares at an average price per share of $1,317.52 and $1,300.72, respectively. We reissued 68,428 shares and 79,076 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, we incurred $7.8 million and $8.1 million of excise tax during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the Inflation Reduction Act which is reflected as a reduction in shareholders' equity in our consolidated financial statements.\nEffect of Currency on Results of Operations\nOur earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings go down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $2.4 million to $2.7 million annually.\nWe also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese \n45\nTable of Contents\nrenminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $2.3 million to $2.6 million annually.  \nIn addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of $39.0 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.\nTaxes\nWe are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as changes in law, the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions, and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions. Generally, the tax liability for each taxpayer within the Mettler-Toledo International Inc. group of companies is determined either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.\nIn addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nInflation\nGlobal inflation continued to moderate during 2024, after rising sharply in 2022 and 2021 related to the COVID-19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand, supply chains/logistics, and labor markets, as well as the war in Ukraine and related significant increase in energy costs and the conflict in the Middle East. Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use, including raw materials to manufacture our products, as well as transportation and logistical costs and other external costs and services. Inflation can also affect labor costs which are a significant element of our overall cost structure. Inflation can also lead to increased interest rates as country monetary policies combat inflation. This can result in reduced economic growth and recessionary conditions, as well as higher borrowing costs. Inflation presents several risks to our business as further described on page 21 in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K, and these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results in future years. \n46\nTable of Contents\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes. \nWe have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements. The fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $3.2 million at December 31, 2024. Based on our agreements outstanding at December 31, 2024, a 100-basis-point change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments by approximately $7.0 million. Any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, income taxes, inventories, goodwill and intangibles, leases, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance of $73.2 million as of December 31, 2024 is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nWe plan to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be non-U.S. withholding taxes, certain state taxes, and U.S. taxes on currency gains, if any. All other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.  \nThe significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, each increase of $10.4 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1%.\n47\nTable of Contents\nEmployee benefit plans\nThe net periodic pension cost for 2024 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024 were $3.0 million and $99.9 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension plan. The net periodic cost for 2024 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024 were $7.2 million and $924.9 million, respectively, for our international pension plans. The expected post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024 for our U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan was $0.5 million.\nPension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations. The most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense.\nThe expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets, which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities. In 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2024, the weighted average return on assets assumption was 6.75% for the U.S. plan and 4.06% for the international plans. A change in the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately $8.7 million after tax.\nThe discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds. For 2024, the weighted average discount rate assumption was 5.34% for the U.S. plan and 1.57% for the international plans, representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A change in the discount rate of 1% would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately $8.5 million after tax.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $668.9 million and other intangible assets of $257.1 million.\nOur business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. \nIf we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative impairment test by estimating the fair value of the respective reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recognized. \n48\nTable of Contents\nBoth the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results, business plans, economic conditions, and market data, among other factors. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.\nShould any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.\nOur amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.",
