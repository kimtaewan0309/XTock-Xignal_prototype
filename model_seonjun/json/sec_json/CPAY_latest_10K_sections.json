  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nEffective March 25, 2024, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. changed its corporate \nname\n to Corpay, Inc. At that time, we ceased \ntrading under the ticker symbol \"FLT\" and began trading under our new ticker symbol, \"CPAY\", on the New York Stock \nExchange (NYSE) and have been a member of the S&P 500 since 2018. Corpay is a global corporate payments company that \nhelps businesses and consumers better manage and pay their expenses. Corpay's suite of modern payment solutions help \ncustomers better manage vehicle-related expenses (e.g., fueling, tolls, car registrations and parking), lodging expenses (e.g., \nhotel and extended stay bookings) and corporate payments (e.g., domestic and international accounts payable and point of sale \npurchases). This results in our customers saving time and ultimately spending less. Since its incorporation in 2000, Corpay has \ndelivered payment and spend solutions with customized controls and robust capabilities that offer our customers a better way to \npay.  \nBusinesses spend an estimat\ned \n$145 trillion\n each\n year in transactions with other businesses. In many instances, businesses lack \nthe proper tools to monitor what is being purchased and employ manual, paper-based, disparate processes and methods to both \napprove and make payments for their business-to-business purchases. This often results in wasted time and money due to \nunnecessary or unauthorized spending, fraud, receipt collection, data input and consolidation errors, inaccurate reimbursement \nprocessing, account reconciliation errors, employee misuse and more.\nDigital payments are faster and more secure than paper-based methods such as checks, provide timely and detailed data that can \nbe utilized to effectively reduce unauthorized purchases and fraud, automate data entry and reporting and eliminate \nreimbursement mistakes. Combining this payment data with analytical tools delivers powerful insights, which managers can use \nto better run their businesses.\n  \nCorpay’s vision is that every payment is digital, every purchase is controlled and every related decision is informed. Our wide \nrange of modern, digitized solutions provide control, reporting and automation benefits superior to many of the payment \nmethods businesses often use such as cash, paper checks, general purpose credit cards, as well as employee payment processes. \nIn addition to delivering meaningful value to our customers, our solutions also share several important and attractive business \nmodel characteristics including: \n•\nthe majority of revenue is derived primarily from business customers, which tend to have relatively predictable, \nconsistent volumes;\n•\nrecurring revenue models driven by recurring volume, resulting in predictable revenue;\n•\nunique selling systems with common sales approaches, management and reporting;\n•\nspecialized technology platforms and proprietary payment acceptance networks, which create competitive advantages \nand barriers to entry; and\n•\nhigh EBITDA margins and cash flow translation with limited infrastructure investment requirements.\nWe actively market and sell to current and prospective customers using a multi-channel, go-to-market strategy, which includes \ncomprehensive digital channels, direct sales forces and strategic partner relationships. We sell stand-alone products and services \nand are currently deploying platforms where a single customer can use multiple products from one user interface. It is important \nto note that we compete mostly with legacy payment companies and traditional ways of paying, such as cash and checks. We \nsupplement our organic growth strategy and sales efforts by pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities, which serve to \nstrengthen and extend our market positions and create value faster. With a long, proven operating history, Corpay facilitates \npayments to or on behalf of millions of businesses around the world using multiple modalities.\nCorpay has the following reportable segments: Vehicle Payments, Corporate Payments, Lodging Payments and Other. These \nsegments reflect how we organize and manage our global employee base, manage operating performance and execute on \nstrategic initiatives. Our Vehicle Payments solutions help control and monitor spending and include fuel card offerings, tolls \nand other complementary products. Our Corporate Payments solutions simplify and automate vendor payments and include \naccounts payable (AP) automation, virtual cards, cross-border payments and purchasing and travel and entertainment (\"T&E\") \ncard products. Our Lodging Payments solutions help businesses manage their lodging costs, while simplifying the management \nof hotels and housing, both short and longer-term, while also providing traveler and end customer support. \n5\nTable of Contents\nVehicle Payments\nOur Vehicle Payments solutions are purpose-built to enable our customers to pay for vehicle related expenses. For our business \ncustomers, we also provide greater control and visibility of spending when compared with less specialized payment methods, \nsuch as cash or general-purpose credit cards. Our digital enabled solutions provide customers with significant control \ncapabilities such as, customizable user-level controls, programmable alerts and detailed transaction reporting. Furthermore, our \nbusiness customers can use the data, controls and tools to combat employee misuse and fraud, streamline expense \nadministration and potentially lower their operating costs, accessible through sophisticated web portals and mobile applications. \nFor our consumer customers, our Vehicle Payment solutions provide seamless, mobile first digital experience when paying for \ncertain vehicle related expenses, removing the friction associated with alternative payment methods and having to use multiple \nservice providers.\nWe utilize both proprietary and third-party payment acceptance networks to deliver our Vehicle Payments solutions. In our \nproprietary networks, which tend to be geographically distinct and unique to the markets we serve, transactions are processed \non applications and operating systems owned and operated by us, and only at select participating merchants with whom we \nhave contracted directly for acceptance. These proprietary networks generally provide us with better economics, as we control \nmore of the transaction, and richer data because of how the networks and point of sale software are configured. Third-party \nnetworks are operated by independent parties, such as MasterCard and VISA, and tend to be more broadly accepted, which is \nthe primary benefit compared with our proprietary networks. \nFuel \n– \nOur fuel solutions are used by customers to pay and control spending for fuel for vehicles and fleets. Our fuel solutions \nare fuel type agnostic (fossil fuel, electricity, etc.). We offer fuel solutions to businesses and government entities who operate \nvehicle fleets, as well as to consumers primarily in Brazil, Mexico and Europe. At the most basic level, we provide the \nmeasurement of fuel used and facilitate the payment for that fuel to the merchant, whether that fuel be diesel, gasoline, \ncompressed natural gas or electricity, while also providing online control, reporting and tracking capabilities to fleet operators. \nIn many cases we can also deliver fuel price savings to our business customers when compared to the retail price of fuel. In the \nU.K. and Europe, we also enable fleets to significantly streamline the VAT reclaim process by digitizing and itemizing fuel \nreceipts in a way that is compliant with tax authority requirements.\nThe measurement, control and payment needs of our customers operating electric vehicles (EV) are similar to those operating \ntraditional, internal combustion vehicles, just centered around electricity usage instead of gas or diesel usage. As we help our \ncustomers manage through the transition to EVs, many will operate \"mixed\" fleets (i.e., fleets with a combination of internal \ncombustion vehicles and EVs) for a long period of time and will need access to all types of fueling, including networks of fuel \nstations, electric charging stations both on the road and at the office and at-home charging options. Considering the increased \ncomplexity of managing a mixed or an all EV fleet, our product sets are positioned to remain valuable and capture transaction \neconomics, regardless of the vehicle type or propulsion method. We have also enhanced our customer platforms and reporting \ncapabilities to ensure a fully integrated mixed fleet experience for our customers, so they can capture and review all the relevant \nfleet insights in one place, eliminating the need to select alternative providers for different fuel types or manage disparate \nsystems.\nMany of our solutions also have additional capabilities. For example, we can enable the fuel card to allow customers to \npurchase a limited set of non-fuel items, such as oil, tolls, parking and vehicle maintenance supplies. Our proprietary EV \nnetworks in the U.K. and western Europe, combined with our Mastercard network in the U.S., offer access to hundreds of \nthousands of charge points and the management of at-home charging, while also delivering additional value-added services \nthrough a mobile app, including the ability to locate and route to a charge-point, charge-point recharging speed, functionality \nand whether in use. Our EV home-charging software solution is aimed at fleets that need to accurately reimburse drivers for \ncharging that takes place at home for business purposes, capturing, measuring and accurately pricing relevant charging sessions \nand is directly integrated with energy companies to facilitate direct payment, thus bypassing the home energy account. We are \nactively expanding our EV footprint to accommodate charging in the U.S., U.K. and Europe.\nWe also provide program management services to major oil companies, leasing companies and fuel marketers, which allow \nthese partners to outsource the sales, marketing, credit, service and system operations of their branded fuel card portfolios. Our \nfuel partners include British Petroleum (BP), Arco, Speedway, Casey's and fuel marketers of all sizes.  On the EV side, we also \nprovide similar modular solutions to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who wish to distribute on-road EV charging \nsolutions to consumers buying an EV. We would typically either white-label our charging app or integrate directly via \napplication programming interface (API) with vehicle OEMs to deliver access to our products. Our vehicle OEM partners \ninclude Renault, NIO, Polestar and Jaguar-Land Rover.\nTolls \n– \nOperated primarily in Brazil, we are the leading electronic toll payments provider to businesses and consumers in the \nform of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags affixed to vehicle windshiel\nds. Our tolls solution primarily operates on our \nproprietary Sem Parar\nTM\n network, which processes transactions for more than 7.5 million tagholders on 100% of the toll roads \nthat accept RFID across Brazil. We provide convenience and faster travel for customers, while also reducing manual labor and \ncash handling at merchants’ toll booths. Our tolls solution also provides commercial customers with driver routing controls and \nfare auditing, mostly in the form of vehicle type and axle count configuration. \n6\nTable of Contents\nOur tags may also be used at approximately 7,300 participating merchant locations to purch\nase goods and services \nwhile in the \nvehicle, such as parking, fuel, car washes and meals at drive-through restaurants.\n At merchant locations, payment via electronic \ntags is faster, safer and more secure for customers, which in turn increases loyalty and throughput for merchants and eliminates \nthe handling of cash. \nParking \n– \nOur parking app for mobile devices allows millions of consumers and fleets to instantaneously pay for parking, \nreplacing the use of coins or cash for parking. Our solution also allows business fleets the ability to manage their vehicles from \nanywhere, add and remove authorized drivers and pay in a secured and approved modality. Given the high frequency nature of \nuse and the millions of monthly active users on the app, parking lends itself to further extension into the other services we offer, \nnamely EV charging, insurance, maintenance and fueling, amongst others. Our parking solutions are available in the U.S., \nCanada, Europe, the U.K. and Brazil.\nVehicle Compliance \n– \nOur apps for mobile devices in Brazil allow millions of drivers to pay for vehicle taxes, vehicle \nregistration and parking and fines instantly. These solutions help drivers manage and monitor their vehicle's and license's \ncompliance by leveraging technology and data in consolidated and efficient platforms. \nFleet Maintenance \n– \nWe provide a SaaS-based vehicle management solution that helps major leasing companies, as well as \nfleet operators of all sizes, to manage their vehicle maintenance, service and repair needs primarily in the U.K., and also in \nGermany, France, Denmark, Ireland, Australia and Portugal. This solution is provided through our proprietary maintenance and \nrepair network, which, in the U.K., processes transactions for fleet customers at approximately\n 9,000 service centers.\n The same \nplatform also provides leasing companies with the ability to manage the re-marketing of leased vehicles and any ad-hoc vehicle \nrental needs. In addition, we offer compliance services to the U.K.’s heavy goods (truck) operators, workshops and drivers. \nAlso, we are increasingly extending the platform for use in the small fleet and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) \nspace, enabling consumers to access our proprietary maintenance network at advantaged economics to them. Finally, we offer \ntire repair and management services to leasing companies and large fleets, servicing over one million vehicles across \napproximately 25,000 tire centers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic and Hungary.\nBenefits \n– \nIn Mexico and Brazil, we offer prepaid food vouchers or cards that may be used as a form of payment in restaurants \nand grocery stores. Additionally, in Brazil, we offer prepaid transportation cards and vouchers that may be used by commuting \nemployees as a form of payment on public transportation.\nCorporate Payments\nOur Corporate Payments solutions help businesses streamline the management, processing and payment of their domestic and \ninternational invoices and make point-of-sale purchases for their employees. Companies can save time, reduce costs and \nmanage business-to-business\n (B2B) \npayment processing more efficiently with our suite of Corporate Payment solutions, \nincluding accounts payable (AP) automation, virtual cards, cross-border payment products and purchasing and T&E cards. \nAP Automation\n \n– We offer AP Automation solutions with options that are purpose-built for the simplest small business to the \nmost complex large enterprise. We initiate, manage and guarantee payment of all company-approved bills to all domestic and \ninternational vendors through whichever payment modalities the vendors allow, such as virtual card, automated clearing house \n(ACH), wire or check. Our mid-market/enterprise solution meets the needs of the most complex global enterprises with \nmultiple organizational hierarchies, approval workflows, locations, bank accounts, robust on-demand reporting and seamless \nintegration with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. We also provide rich data on the remittance to the vendor, \nregardless of payment modality, which facilitates invoice reconciliations and payment posting.  By automating the process of \npaying vendors, businesses of all sizes can reduce the time, costs and fraud risks associated with their payment processes and \nfocus on operating their businesses.  \nVirtual Card\n \n– Our Virtual Card solution provides a single-use card number for a specific amount, usable within a defined \ntimeframe. Virtual Cards provide enhanced security relative to checks while reducing total payment costs for our customers. \nFull remittance data accompanies each Virtual Card payment, providing significant reconciliation advantages to ACH and \ncheck payments. We have integrated our Virtual Card offering into most leading ERP systems, providing a seamless experience \nfor our customer's accounts payable personnel.\n  \nWe have built a proprietary merchant acceptance network that accepts our Virtual Card payments. Our merchant acceptance \nnetwork is unique due to the nature of commercial Virtual Card acceptance. Unlike standard point-of-sale purchases, each \nissuer negotiates directly with the merchant for acceptance, so other issuers’ virtual cards are not interchangeable. This network \nis managed with proprietary technology that allows us to continuously expand Virtual Card acceptance and optimize the \namount of spend we can capture. The scale of this network, coupled with an in-house vendor enrollment service, is a \ncompetitive advantage. Our ERP integrations, API capabilities, strategic vendor enrollment and transaction management tools \nenable us to optimize our customers’ electronic payables programs. \nOur Virtual Card solution operates on the Mastercard network. Our customers’ ERP systems are directly integrated with our \nissuing system, and merchants must be enrolled in our proprietary vendor network to accept our Virtual Card solution. This \ntwo-sided transaction, where both payor and receiver are in our network, provides substantial payment security relative to paper \nchecks or ACH. \n7\nTable of Contents\nCross-Border Payments\n \n– Our Cross-Border solution is used by our customers to pay international vendors, foreign office and \npersonnel expenses and for profit repatriation and dividends. We also offer hedging and risk management services to customers, \nwhich helps them manage foreign exchange rate exposures in the course of doing business internationally. This solution may be \nsold in conjunction with our AP Automation and Virtual Card solutions. \nTrade settlement and payment delivery is facilitated through a global network of correspondent banks, in-country payment \ngateways and technology providers, enabling us to send payments to recipients in over 200 countries and 145 currencies. Our \ncustomers rely on us to deliver personalized service and customer solutions. We offer a proprietary trading and payments \nplatform that we can \"white label\" for financial institutions looking to expand their cross-border payment capability, as well as \na suite of API products that enables us to embed our full capability directly within the technology of both customers and \npartners. By utilizing transaction monitoring and \"watch list\" screening systems, we ensure payments are safe, secure and meet \nall applicable regulatory requirements.\n  \nPurchasing and T&E Cards \n– We offer purchasing cards and T&E solutions to our customers. These solutions are generally \nsold in conjunction with our Virtual Card solution or AP Automation offerings. Additionally, we provide technology, which \ncombines and leverages transaction data captured from our virtual, purchasing and T&E card products, to help our customers \nanalyze and manage their corporate spending.\n \nLodging Payments\nOur Lodging Payments solutions help businesses manage and control their lodging costs, simplify the management offerings \nfrom hotels or longer term housing arrangements and provide traveler and end customer support. We serve lodging customers \nthrough three primary verticals: workforce, airlines and insurance. We offer lodging solutions to businesses primarily in North \nAmerica and the U.K. that have employees who travel overnight for work purposes, to airlines and cruise lines globally to \naccommodate both their traveling crews and stranded passengers and to policyholders displaced from their homes due to \ndamage or catastrophe on behalf of property insurance carriers. \nThe size, scale and nature of our lodging customer base enables us to negotiate lodging nightly rates lower than the rates most \ncompanies could negotiate directly and below the rates available to the general public. We utilize both proprietary and third-\nparty networks where we provide access to deeply discounted hotel rooms with streamlined travel management programs, \nproviding enhanced controls and reporting, audit and tax management services. We also can secure hotel rooms outside our \nproprietary networks in each of our solutions, or private homes in our insurance vertical. We use proprietary data management \nand payment processing systems to manage customer billings and reports, which, combined with our discounted hotel network, \nprovide customers with potential savings and increased visibility into their lodging costs.  \nWorkforce \n– \nOur workforce lodging solutions provide a comprehensive solution for business travel programs of any size and  \nbusiness profile, with the ability to scale to the needs of the customer. Our solution allows customers to find and book lodging \nonline, via app, directly with the hotel or by calling us. We provide full-service lodging management for project-based travelers \nand long-term stay programs. Our solution provides customers options, controls and insights they need to streamline their \ncorporate lodging program and optimize their investment in travel. \nAirlines \n–\nThe integration of our processing systems with airline logistics and crew management systems enables us to deliver \nincremental enhanced services to the airline travel industry. We offer end-to-end automation of the crew layover process, \nproviding cost-saving hotel and transport bookings. We also have a proactive disruption system managing flight rebookings, \nhotels, meals, compensation and transportation for distressed passengers, which delivers a notification directly to the affected \npassenger to self-service based on their individual requirements. With an all-in-one platform, airlines can access automated \nweb-based billing and continual transaction auditing that's tied to their operational data to increase billing accuracy. \n  \nInsurance \n– \nWe provide temporary housing solutions for displaced policyholders of insurance carriers and catastrophe teams, \nserving at the request and approval of the insurance adjuster, delivering a seamless housing experience. We partner with claims \nadjusters to determine the best housing solution for policyholders, including extended stay hotels and long-term housing, \nproviding policyholders a mobile app to manage their temporary housing and receipts. \nOther\nCorpay provides other payments solutions that are not considered within our Vehicle Payments, Corporate Payments or \nLodging Payments segments.\nGift \n– We provide fully integrated gift card program management and processing services to retailers in 66 countries, in both \nplastic and digital form. The gift cards are issued specifically for each customer under their specific brands and are generally \naccepted exclusively within their retail network, digitally or in-person. \nOur gift solutions include card design, production and packaging, delivery and fulfillment, card and account management, \ntransaction processing, promotion development and management, website design and hosting, program analytics and card \ndistribution channel management. Our turnkey solution benefits our customers in the form of brand promotion, cardholder \nloyalty, increased sales, interest on prepaid balances and breakage on abandoned card balances.\n8\nTable of Contents\nPayroll Card \n– We offer a payroll card solution in North America in the form of a reloadable stored value card, that can be used \ninstead of a paper payroll check. Our solution operates on the Mastercard payment network and the Allpoint ATM network. \nThe payroll cards are issued to our customers’ employees and funded by the employees’ wages. As cardholders, the employees \nmay present the payroll card as a form of payment for personal purchases, transfer funds to their bank account or withdraw \nfunds from participating ATMs. \nSales and Distribution\n \nWe actively market and sell our solutions to current and prospective customers using a multi-channel approach. This go-to-\nmarket strategy includes comprehensive digital channels, direct sales forces and strategic partner relationships. We continue to \nexpand online, end-to-end capability where the customers can buy, onboard and manage their accounts on their own. In \naddition, we leverage an omni-channel approach that enables our sales people to be more efficient by improving their \nprospecting efforts through digitally sourced leads. In our direct sales force channel, we acquire and manage the customer \nrelationship, which has historically been either in-person or via telesales. Our capabilities are also offered through indirect sales \nchannels (e.g., major oil companies and fuel marketers for fuel, retail establishments for tolls and vehicle OEMs for consumer \nEV solutions) and on a branded or “white label” basis, indirectly through a broad range of resellers and partners across most of \nour solutions. In doing so, we leverage their sales networks to expand our reach into new customer segments, new industry \nverticals and new geographies faster and at a significantly lower cost.  \nWith respect to our tolls solution, we also place proprietary manned kiosks and unmanned vending machines in areas with high \nconsumer foot traffic, such as shopping malls, to reach consumers. With respect to our gift solutions, third-party distribution is \ngenerally provided by other companies, who are reliant on access to our systems to meet their distribution obligations. With \nrespect to our parking solutions, we sign deals with municipalities, local authorities and other parking operators to offer a \ndigital parking app to drivers who need to pay for parking in their locations. Typically, signage is prominently displayed in the \nparking location to direct drivers to download our parking app to facilitate booking and payment. This same app is then used as \na tool to sell other products & services to these users.\nWe\n capitalize on our products’ specialization by deploying product-dedicated sales forces to target specific customer segments. \nAs our solution set has expanded, we are also facilitating cross-selling and bundled product offerings to fully leverage our \ndistribution capabilities, capture more spend and revenue from our existing customer base and deliver more value to customers \nwhich should improve customer loyalty and retention.\nCredit Underwriting and Collections\nWe perform a detailed application review of all new applications for credit, evaluating the applications for fraud as well as \ncredit risk. With both the fraud and credit review, we leverage third-party data sources, including device data, fraud scores and \ncredit bureau data to name a few. The credit review includes a combination of machine learning models, as well as judgmental \nunderwriting based on customer financials. We employ a variety of tools to manage risk in our portfolio, including billing \nfrequency, payment terms, spending limits, payment methods, delinquency suspension and security. Further, we use fraud \ndetection programs, including proprietary and third-party solutions, to monitor transactions and prevent misuse. We monitor the \ncredit quality of our portfolio periodically utilizing external credit scores and internal behavior data to identify high risk or \ndeteriorating credit quality accounts and control our risk through various strategies. We conduct targeted strategies to minimize \nexposure to high-risk accounts, including reducing spending limits and payment terms or requiring additional security deposits.\nCompetition\nOur primary competition is from financial institutions providing a full suite of financial products, including general purpose \ncards, AP payments (i.e. check and ACH) and cross-border solutions. We also compete with specialized competitive offerings \nfrom other companies that vary by product solution.\n•\nVehicle Payments: Our fuel solutions compete with similar offerings such as, WEX, U.S. Bank Voyager Fleet \nSystems, Edenred, Sodexo, Alelo, Radius Payment Solutions and DKV.  Our toll solutions compete with similar \nofferings such as, ConectCar, Veloe (Alelo) and Repom (Edenred). Our parking solutions compete with similar \nofferings such as ParkMobile, ParkHub, Parking BOXX and FLASH. \n•\nCorporate Payments: Our corporate payments solutions compete with similar offerings from financial institutions, \nincluding American Express, Coupa, AvidXchange, Bill.com and Convera. \n•\nLodging Payments: Our lodging solutions compete with similar offerings from traditional travel management \ncompanies such as, American Express Global Business Travel, as well as in-house travel solutions at large \ncorporations and airlines.\n•\nOther; Our gift and payroll card solutions compete with similar offerings from Fiserv, other special-purpose card \nissuers and payroll companies.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCompetitive Advantage   \nIn executing our strategy, we are advantaged by our competitive strengths:\n•\nGlobal Scale\n – We have strong market positions across four continents. This enables us to provide new offerings with \nbetter cost economics, sell complementary products, acquire attractive assets that can leverage existing infrastructure \nand cost synergies and introduce successful products and practices from other markets.\n•\nCompounding Growth Model\n – Our growth model historically benefits from strong revenue retention, organic growth \nfrom new customer acquisitions and selling more value-added products to current customers, via developed and \nacquired payment solutions.  \n•\nProprietary Networks\n – Our specialized proprietary networks allow for unique data capture at the point of sale, \nproviding an incremental value proposition to our customers. These proprietary networks also provide us with \nadvantageous economics by providing attractive, captive spend to the merchant base.\n•\nScalable Technology\n – Our easy-to-use platforms provide control and functionality for our customers, and we can on-\nboard incremental customer volume with very limited need for additional infrastructure. We own and control all the \ncritical components to our offering, creating improved speed to market and proprietary feature functionality in the \nmarketplace.\n•\nDiversification\n – Our solutions and geographic diversification are designed to provide stability through the “portfolio \neffect” when one geography or business is underperforming relative to the others. This allows Corpay to deliver more \nconsistent financial performance relative to competitors, continue to invest throughout business cycles and reallocate \nresources to higher performing businesses.   \nTechnology\nOur technology provides continuous authorization of transactions, processing of critical account and customer information and \nsettlement between merchants, issuing companies and individual commercial entities. We recognize the importance of state-of-\nthe-art, s\necure, efficient and reliable technology in our business and have made significant investments in our applications and \ninfrastructure. In \n2024\n, we spent approximately $380 million in capital and operating expenses to operate, protect and enhance \nour technology.  \nWe operate several proprietary processing systems that provide features and functionality to run our card programs and \nsolutions, including our card issuing, processing and information services. Our processing systems also integrate with our \nproprietary networks, which provide brand awareness and connectivity to our acceptance locations that enables the “end-to-\nend” card acceptance, da\nta capture and transaction authorization capabilities of our card programs. Our proprietary processing \nsystems and aggregation software are tailored to meet the unique needs of the individual markets they serve and enable us to \ncreate and deliver solutions that serve each of our industry verticals and geographies. Our technology platforms are comprised \nof four key components, which were primarily developed and are maintained in-house: (1) a core processing platform; (2) \nspecialized software; (3) integrated network capabilities; and (4) a cloud-based architecture with proprietary APIs.\nOur technology function is based in the U.S., Europe and Brazil and has expertise in the management of applications, \ntransaction networks and infrastructure. We operate application development centers in the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, Czech \nRepublic, Brazil and New Zealand. Our distributed application architecture allows us to maintain, administer and innovate our \nsolutions in a cost-effective and flexible manner. Our solutions contain significant intellectual property that differentiates us \nfrom our competition.\nW\ne continually seek to modernize and evolve our technology solutions through our core information technology (IT) \ntransformation initiatives. Our IT transformation initiatives are focused on three main pillars: (1) digital strategy; (2) core \nsystems modernization; and (3) data. Our digital strategy is focused on streamlining a digital customer experience across all of \nour solutions, providing a seamless experience. Additionally, we are investing in modernizing our core transactional systems to \nmake them more resilient, secure and scalable. Our technology infrastructure is supported by highly-secure data centers, with \nredundant locations. We operate our primary data centers, located in Atlanta, Georgia; Studley, United Kingdom; Prague, \nCzech Republic; Las Vegas, Nevada; Lexington and Louisville, Kentucky; São Paulo, Brazil; and Toronto, Canada. \nAdditionally, as we develop new solutions and modernize legacy assets, we increasingly use  cloud services. Through the use of \ncloud technology and microservices, we are able to modernize our platforms with no disruption to our customers. Finally, data \nis becoming an ever-increasing part of how we and our customers do business. We are focused on investing in our data assets to \ndeliver value for our customers through improved insights to help them to better control expenses and mitigate fraud. The use \nof cloud services provides us with increased flexibility and agility. We use only proven technology and expect no foreseeable \ncapacity limitations. \nWe maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Our telecommunications and internet systems have multiple levels \nof redundancy to ensure the reliability of network\n service. In \n2024\n, we achieved over 99.9% up-time for authorizations globally.\n10\nTable of Contents\nSafeguarding Our Business \nTo provide our services, we may collect, use and store sensitive business information and personal information. Some of this \ninformation is also processed and stored by financial institutions, merchants and other entities, as well as third-party service \nproviders to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents, which we refer to collectively as, our associated third \nparties. We may have responsibility to the card networks, financial institutions and in some instances, our customers, and/or \nindividuals, for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties (as applicable) to protect this information. \nOur systems align with industry standards for security, with multiple industry certifications. Our network is configured with \nmultiple layers of security to isolate our core systems from unauthorized access. We use secure communication among \napplications, and our employees access critical components strictly on a \"need-to-know\" basis. We may not be able to \nadequately protect our systems or the data we collect from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks, \nwhich could subject us to liability and damage our reputation. See also, \"Risks related to information technology and security\" \nunder Item 1A for further discussion of the risks we face in connection with our technology systems and potential data breach \nand cybersecurity risks. Also, see Item 1C Cybersecurity for further discussion of our risk management strategy and \ngovernance. \nRegulation\nA substantial number of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, apply to businesses offering payment \nproducts to customers, processing payments and servicing related accounts, or operating payment networks. These laws and \nregulations are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent, and the extent to which they apply to us is at times \nunclear. Failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, \nsuspension, or termination of services or relationships with our bank partners and sponsors and business and sales partners and/\nor the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. Certain of our solutions are also subject to rules set by various \npayment networks, such as Mastercard, as more fully described below.\nThe following, while not exhaustive, is a description of several federal and state laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as \nforeign laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business, and therefore can materially affect our capital expenditures, \nearnings and competitive position. In addition, the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing \nrevision, and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us.\nMoney Transmission and Payment Instrument Licensing Regulations\nWe are subject to various U.S. laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment \ninstruments. In the U.S., most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. Through our subsidiaries, \nwe are licensed in all states where required for business. Many states exercise authority over the operations related to money \ntransmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations, which may include a \nreview of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, privacy and data security \npolicies and procedures and other matters related to our business. As a result of these periodic examinations, state agencies \nsometimes issue to us findings and recommendations, prompting us to make changes to our operations and procedures.\nAs a licensee, we are subject to certain restrictions and requirements, including net worth and surety bond requirements, record \nkeeping and reporting requirements, requirements for regulatory approval of controlling stockholders or direct and indirect \nchanges of control of the licensee and certain other corporate events and requirements to maintain certain levels of permissible \ninvestments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations. Many states as well as the Financial Crimes \nEnforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (FinCEN) also require money transmitters and issuers of \npayment instruments to comply with federal and state anti-money laundering laws (AML) and regulations. See “Anti-Money \nLaundering, Counter Terrorist and Sanctions Regulations.”\nRecently, a number of state legislatures have adopted all or parts of a new money transmission and sales of payment \ninstruments model law, the Money Transmission Modernization Act. State laws regarding money transmission and sales of \npayment instruments requirements may continue to change in the future. Additionally, government agencies may impose new \nor additional requirements on money transmission and sales of payment instruments. We expect that compliance costs will \nincrease in the future for our regulated subsidiaries.\nPrivacy and Information Security Laws and Regulations\nWe provide services that are subject to various state, federal and foreign privacy and information security laws and regulations \nincluding, among others, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its Network \nand Information Security (NIS) Directive, the U.K.'s GDPR and NIS Regulations, Canada’s Personal Information Protection \nand Electronic Documents Act and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law. In the U.S., we are now subject to several \ncomprehensive data privacy laws at the state level, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the \nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act (effective July 1, 2023), \nthe Connecticut Data Privacy Act (effective July 1, 2023) and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (effective December 31, 2023). \nWe are also subject to the separate security breach notification laws of each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Some \nnon-U.S. data protection laws, including in the U.K. and EU, impose restrictions on the international transfer of personal data \n11\nTable of Contents\nabsent lawfully recognized transfer mechanisms or, in some cases, prohibit such transfer completely. Going forward, we will \nlikely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the U.S. and abroad, which could result in additional costs of \ncompliance, enforcement actions, regulatory investigations and fines, individual or class action litigation, or reputational harm.\nThese and similar laws and their related regulations collectively restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use and \ndisclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights \nto prevent use and disclosure of protected information. Some also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper \ndestruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. In many cases they impose \nobligations to notify affected individuals, state officers or other governmental authorities, the media and consumer reporting \nagencies, as well as businesses and governmental agencies, of security breaches affecting personal information. In addition, \nsome restrict the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers. \nThese laws and regulations are complex and evolving and can provide for significant penalties for non-compliance. We incur \nand expect to continue to incur significant and ongoing operating costs as part of our efforts to comply with applicable laws and \nregulations regarding personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other \nbusiness initiatives. \nCertain of our products that access payment networks require compliance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security \nstandards. See “Payment Card Industry Rules.”\nEmail and Text Marketing Laws and Regulations\nWe use email marketing and text-messaging to reach out to current or potential customers and therefore are subject to various \nstatutes, regulations and rulings, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the Controlling the Assault of \nNon-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) \norders. Several states have enacted additional, more restrictive and punitive laws regulating telemarketing and commercial \nemail. Foreign legislation exists as well, including Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation and the European laws that have been \nenacted pursuant to European Union Directive 2002/58/EC and its amendments. Although we believe that our telemarketing \nand email practices comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, violations could result in enforcement actions, statutory \nfines and penalties, class action litigation and reputational harm. \nUnfair or Deceptive Business Practices\nAll persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our bank sponsors and customers, are subject to \nregulatory enforcement by the FTC, under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and state attorneys general, under \nvarious consumer-protection statutes, prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and certain products also are subject to \nthe jurisdiction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive \nacts and practices. As a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors, we may further be subject to direct supervision and \nexamination by federal banking regulators in connection with certain of our products and services, which may increase our \ncompliance costs. If we are accused of violating any of these laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement \nactions and as a result, may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.\nLending Regulations\nWe are subject to several laws and related regulations governing the provision and administration of credit. The Truth in \nLending Act (TILA) was enacted as a consumer protection measure to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and to \nprotect consumers from unauthorized charges or billing errors and is implemented by the CFPB’s Regulation Z. Most \nprovisions of TILA and Regulation Z apply only to the extension of consumer credit, but a limited number of provisions apply \nto commercial cards as well. One example where TILA and Regulation Z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for \nunauthorized use, although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive \nliability. Our cardholder agreements generally provide that these business customers waive, to the fullest extent possible, all \nlimitations on liability for unauthorized card use. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) together with Regulation B \nprohibit creditors from discriminating on certain prohibited bases, such as an applicant’s sex, race, nationality, age and marital \nstatus and further requires that creditors disclose the reasons for taking any adverse action against an applicant or a customer \nseeking credit. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates consumer reporting agencies and the disclosure and use of \nconsumer reports. We obtain consumer reports with respect to an individual who guarantees or otherwise is obligated on a \ncommercial card. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 amended FCRA and requires creditors to adopt \nidentity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts, which can \ninclude business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft.\nAnti-Money Laundering, Counter Terrorist and Sanctions Regulations\nThe Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, which is also known as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and which has \nbeen amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains a variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money \nlaundering. Among other things, the BSA and related regulations issued by FinCEN require financial-services providers to \nestablish AML programs, to prohibit the financing of terrorism, to report suspicious activity and to maintain a number of related \nrecords. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by \nthe U.S. Department of \nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified \n12\nTable of Contents\ncountries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist \norganizations. In addition to economic sanctions programs, we are also subject to a number of international laws and \nregulations focused on fighting terrorism and money laundering, including primarily:\n•\nin Canada, Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA);\n•\nin Australia, as a registered remittance dealer with AUSTRAC, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism \nFinancing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act);\n•\nin the U.K., as a registered Electronic Money Institution with the Financial Conduct Authority, the Proceeds of Crime \nAct, 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000; \n•\nin Ireland, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended by Part 2 of the \nCriminal Justice Act 2013 and by the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act \n2018; and \n•\nin the EU, AML requirements promulgated under the 4th, 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives.\nNumerous other countries have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to us. \nNon-banks that provide certain financial services are required to register with FinCEN as “money services businesses” (MSB). \nCertain of our subsidiaries are registered as MSBs.\nIn addition, provisions of the BSA known as the Prepaid Access Rule issued by FinCEN impose certain obligations, such as \nregistration and collection of consumer information, on “providers” of certain prepaid access programs, including the stored \nvalue products issued by our sponsor banks for which we serve as program manager. FinCEN has taken the position that, where \nthe issuing bank has principal oversight and control of such prepaid access programs, no other participant in the distribution \nchain would be required to register as a provider under the Prepaid Access Rule. Despite this position, we have opted to register \nas a provider of prepaid access through our subsidiary, Comdata Inc. \nInterchange Fees\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) effected comprehensive \nrevisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions, financial services and financial markets. The Durbin \nAmendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for \ndebit transactions must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and \nsettling the transaction. Payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in \ncircumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. The Federal Reserve has capped debit interchange fees and may \nreduce the cap in the future, however the cap has not had a material direct impact on our results of operations because we \noperate under an exemption to the cap for the majority of our debit transactions.\nAnti-Bribery Regulations\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures \nand includes anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (SEC). The statute has a broad reach, covering all U.S. companies and citizens doing business \nabroad, among others, and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens \naffiliated with foreign government-run or -owned organizations. The statute also requires maintenance of appropriate books and \nrecords and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. We are subject to similar \nstatutes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.K. Bribery Act.\nPayment Card Industry Rules\nIn connection with certain services we provide for payment cards bearing the Mastercard brand and to those acting as merchants \naccepting those cards, we must comply with the bylaws, regulations and requirements that are promulgated by Mastercard and \nother applicable payment-card organizations, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the \nMastercard Site Data Protection Program (SDP) and other applicable data-security program requirements. A breach of such \npayment card network rules could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the payment networks for \ncertain acts or omissions. The payment networks routinely update and modify their requirements. Our failure to comply with \nthe networks’ requirements or to pay the fines they impose could cause the termination of our registration and require us to stop \nprocessing transactions on their networks. Our subsidiary, Comdata Inc., is PCI DSS 3.2 compliant.\nWe are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National ACH Association relating to payment transactions \nprocessed by us using the ACH network.\n13\nTable of Contents\nEscheat Regulations\nWe may be subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws in the U.S. that require us to turn over to certain \ngovernment authorities the property of others that we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as \npayment instruments that have not been presented for payment and account balances that are due to a customer following \ndiscontinuation of our relationship. We may be subject to audit by individual U.S. states with regard to our escheatment \npractices.\nPrepaid Card Regulations\nPrepaid card programs that we manage may be subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, such as the Credit Card \nAccountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) and the CFPB’s Regulation E, which impose \nrequirements on general-use prepaid cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates. \nState Usury Laws\nExtensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans and may require state licensing. In \nsome states, usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well. \nTo the extent that these usury laws apply, we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our \ncustomers. Because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions, we utilize choice of law provisions in our \ncardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply. With respect to card products where we work with a partner \nor issuing bank, the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “export” the usury limit of \nthat state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions.\nDerivatives Regulations\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), provisions of the European \nMarket Infrastructure Regulation and its technical standards, as well as derivative reporting in Canada and the U.S., have \nsubjected certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer to our customers as part of our cross-border payments \nbusiness to reporting, recordkeeping and other requirements. Additionally, certain foreign exchange derivatives transactions we \nmay enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing requirements, or may be subject to margin requirements in \nthe U.S., U.K. and European Union. Other jurisdictions outside the U.S., U.K. and the European Union are considering, have \nimplemented, or are implementing regulations similar to those described above.\nOther\nWe must contractually comply with certain regulations to which our sponsor banks are subject, as applicable. We may be \nexamined by our sponsor banks’ regulators and be subject to audits by certain sponsor banks relative to such regulations.\nThe Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchants, \nacquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment \ntransactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also \nsubject to backup withholding requirements. We are required to comply with these requirements for the merchants in our \nComdata network. We could be liable for penalties if our information return is not in compliance with these regulations.\nHuman Capital \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Corpay employed approximately 11,200 associates located in 24 countries around the world, with \napproximately 4,300 of those associates based in the U.S\n. At Corpay\n, we strongly\n believe that talent is a determinant of our \nperformance and success. Our values-driven people programs, practices and policies have been developed to ensure we are able \nto attract, retain and develop the quality of talent necessary to advance our key initiatives and achieve our strategic objectives. \nWe are firmly committed to delivering a strong employee value proposition and unique employment experience to our \nassociates which, in turn, should lead to better customer experiences and business outcomes. \nCulture\nOur culture has evolved through time, as we have grown considerably both organically and through acquisitions. Despite \nCorpay’s expansive size and geographic scope, we seek to retain a strong entrepreneurial spirit and share a common vision, \nmission and set of values, which together serve as cornerstones to our “One Corpay” culture.

Our ERGs allow a \nsafe space for employees to connect and discuss experiences. The ERGs also provide Corpay with perspectives on the unique \nneeds and lived experiences of our employees.\nEmployee Wellness\nCorpay’s benefits programs are designed to meet the evolving needs of our workforce across the globe. Because we want our \nemployees and their families to thrive, in additional to our regular benefit offerings, we also focus on physical and mental well-\nbeing. As part of our benefit programs we offer free online fitness classes, discounted gym memberships, weight-loss classes, \nprovide access to employee assistance programs in all regions and Mental Health Awareness programs globally. \nTalent Development\nCorpay offers a variety of high-quality learning opportunities, designed to support employee development and organizational \neffectiveness. Learning opportunities are available in all geographies at all levels and incorporate personal, business and \nleadership skills development with the goal of empowering our organization, creating avenues for closing skill gaps and \nenhancing the capabilities of our workforce. Leadership, teamwork, communication and many other soft skills are vital to our \nsuccess. We offer a wide variety of career opportunities and paths to advancement through on-the-job coaching, training and \neducation. We are proud to be a company where an associate can start as an intern and turn it into a successful career.\nThe Voice of the Employee\nWe continue to develop and refine our people programs based on feedback we receive directly from our workforce, which we \ngather through a survey of all employees globally. The participation rate for our 2024 survey was approximately 54%. Our \nemployee engagement score in 2024 remained consistent with previous years. We believe our employee proposition remains \nstrong and we continue to attract and retain top talent. We continue to share the detailed engagement scores across the \norganization and analyze the results to understand differences by geography, demographics, job level and leader, and to identify \nopportunities for further improvement. We also conduct pulse surveys and focus groups to assess the ongoing engagement of \nour workforce. \nIn January 2025, Corpay published its latest Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Report (CRS Report), in which we \nprovided detailed information about the Company’s views and approaches regarding environmental, social and governance \nissues.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \nthe consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, \nthis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual \nresults to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not \nlimited to, those identified below and those described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” appearing elsewhere in this report. All foreign \ncurrency amounts that have been converted into U.S. dollars in this discussion are based on the exchange rate as reported by \nOanda for the applicable periods.  \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations generally discusses \n2024\n and \n2023\n \nitems, with year-over-year comparisons between these two years. A detailed discussion of \n2023\n items and year-over-year \ncomparisons between \n2023\n and \n2022\n that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, \n2023\n.\nExecutive Overview\nEffective March 25, 2024, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. changed its corporate name to Corpay, Inc. At that time, we ceased \ntrading under the ticker symbol \"FLT\" and began trading under our new ticker symbol, \"CPAY\", on the New York Stock \nExchange (NYSE). Corpay is a global corporate payments company that helps businesses and consumers better manage and \npay their expenses. Corpay's suite of modern payment solutions help customers better manage vehicle-related expenses (e.g., \nfueling, tolls, car registration and parking), lodging expenses (e.g., hotel and extended stay bookings) and corporate payments \n(e.g., domestic and international accounts payable and point of sale purchases).  This results in our customers saving time and \nultimately spending less. Since its incorporation in 2000, Corpay has delivered payment and spend solutions with customized \ncontrols and robust capabilities that offer our customers a better way to pay. \nBusinesses spend an estimated \n$145 trillion\n each year in transactions with other businesses. In many instances, businesses lack \nthe proper tools to monitor what is being purchased and employ manual, paper-based, disparate processes and methods to both \napprove and make payments for their business-to-business purchases. This often results in wasted time and money due to \nunnecessary or unauthorized spending, fraud, receipt collection, data input and consolidation, report generation, reimbursement \nprocessing, account reconciliations, employee disciplinary actions and more. \nCorpay’s vision is that every payment is digital, every purchase is controlled and every related decision is informed. Digital \npayments are faster and more secure than paper-based methods such as checks and provide timely and detailed data that can be \nutilized to effectively reduce unauthorized purchases and fraud, automate data entry and reporting, and eliminate reimbursement \nprocesses. Combining this payment data with analytical tools delivers insights, which managers can use to better run their \nbusinesses. Our wide range of modern, digitized solutions generally provides control, reporting and automation benefits \nsuperior to many of the payment methods businesses often use such as cash, paper checks, general purpose credit cards, as well \nas employee pay and reclaim processes. \nRussia Disposition\nWe completed the sale of our Russia business on August 15, 2023. The sale included the entirety of our operations in Russia \nand resulted in a complete exit from the Russia market. We received total proceeds, net of cash disposed and net of a \n$5.6 million\n foreign exchange loss upon conversion of the ruble-denominated proceeds to U.S. dollars, of \n$197.0 million\n, \nwhich have been recorded within investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year \nended December 31, 2023. In connection with the sale, we recorded a net gain on disposal of \n$13.7 million\n during the year \nended December 31, 2023, which represents the proceeds received less the derecognition of the related net assets, the \nreclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation losses, and the foreign exchange loss upon conversion of the ruble-\ndenominated proceeds to U.S. dollars. \nExclusive of the impact of disposition, our business in Russia accounted for approximately \n$62.0 million\n of our \nincome\n before \nincome taxes for the year\n ended December 31, \n2023\n. \nComdata Merchant Solutions Disposition\nIn\n May 2024, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the  merchant solutions business, a business within the U.S. division of \nour Vehicle Payments segment (the \"disposal group\") to a third party. The transaction was completed during December 2\n024. \nThe disposal grou\np's as\nsets and liabilities were recorded at their carrying value. \nGoodwill\n of approximately \n$58.2 million\n was \nallocated to the carrying value of the disposal group based on a relative fair value analysis. \nWe received total proce\ne\nds of \n$185.5 million\n, which have been recorded within investing activities in the accompanying \nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n In connection with the sale, we recorded a net gain on disposal of \n$121.3 million\n \nduring the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, which represents the proceeds received less the derecognition of the related net \nassets. \n37\nResults\nRevenues, net, Net Income Attributable to Corpay and Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to Corpay.\n Set forth below \nare revenues, net, net income attributable to Corpay and net income per diluted share attributable to Corpay for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n (in millions, except per share amounts).  \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenues, net\n$\n3,974.6\n$\n3,757.7\nNet income attributable to Corpay\n$\n1,003.7\n$\n981.9\nNet income per diluted share attributable to Corpay\n$\n13.97\n$\n13.20\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Corpay, Adjusted Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to Corpay, Adjusted \nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\n Set forth below are \nadjusted net income attributable to Corpay, adjusted net income \nper diluted share attributable to Corpay,\n EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages).\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nAdjusted net income attributable to Corpay\n$\n1,364.1\n$\n1,258.6\nAdjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Corpay\n$\n19.01\n$\n16.92\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1\n$\n2,129.0\n$\n1,994.2\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n1\n53.6\n%\n53.1\n%\n1\n 2024 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are adjusted for a material modification impacting \nstock based compensation expense and a deal related termination expense.\nAdjusted net income attributable to Corpay, adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Corpay, adjusted EBITDA and \nadjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. See the heading entitled \n“Management’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial \nmeasure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, or GAAP. We use adjusted net income attributable to Corpay, adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to \nCorpay, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of \nour core operating performance on a consistent basis. These non-GAAP measures are presented solely to permit investors to \nmore fully understand how our management assesses underlying performance and are not, and should not be viewed as, a \nsubstitute for GAAP measures and should be viewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures.\nSources of Revenue \nCorpay offers a variety of payment solutions that help to simplify, automate, secure, digitize and effectively control the way \nbusinesses and consumers manage and pay their expenses. We provide our payment solutions to our business, merchant, \nconsumer and payment network customers in more than 200 countries around the world today, although we operate primarily in \nthree geographies, with approximately \n81%\n of our business in the U.S., Brazil and the U.K. Our customers may include \ncommercial businesses (obtained through direct and indirect channels) and partners for whom we manage payment programs, \nas well as consumers.  \nWe report information about our operating segments in accordance with the authoritative guidance related to segments. We \nmanage and report our operating results through the following three reportable segments: Vehicle Payments, Corporate \nPayments and Lodging Payments. The remaining results are included within Other, which includes our Gift \nand\n Payroll Card \nbusinesses. These segments align with how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) allocates resources, assesses \nperformance and reviews financial information.  \nOur revenue is generally reported net of the cost for underlying products and services purchased. In this report, we refer to this \nnet revenue as “revenue\" or \"revenues, net\". See “Results of Operations” for additional segment information. \nRevenues, net, by Segment.\n \nFor the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, our segments generated the following revenues, \nnet (in millions):\n38\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nRevenues by Segment*\nRevenues,\nnet\n% of Total\nRevenues, net\nRevenues,\nnet\n% of Total\nRevenues, net\nVehicle Payments\n$\n2,008.8\n51\n%\n$\n2,005.5\n53\n%\nCorporate Payments\n1,221.9\n31\n%\n981.1\n26\n%\nLodging Payments\n488.6\n12\n%\n520.2\n14\n%\nOther\n255.3\n6\n%\n250.9\n7\n%\nConsolidated revenues, net\n$\n3,974.6\n100\n%\n$\n3,757.7\n100\n%\n*Columns may not calculate due to rounding. Other includes our Gift and Payroll card operating segments. \nWe generate revenue in our Vehicle Payments segment through a variety of program fees, including transaction fees, card fees, \nnetwork fees and charges, as well as from interchange. These fees may be charged as fixed amounts, costs plus a mark-up, \nbased on a percentage of the transaction purchase amounts, or a combination thereof. Our programs also include other fees and \ncharges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk. We also generate float revenue earned on invested \ncustomer funds in jurisdictions where permitted. \nIn our Corporate Payments segment, our payables business primarily earns revenue from the difference between the amount \ncharged to the customer and the amount paid to the third party for a given transaction, as interchange or spread revenue. Our \nprograms may also charge fixed fees for access to the network and ancillary services provided. Revenues from risk \nmanagement products and foreign exchange payment services are primarily comprised of the difference between the exchange \nrate we set for the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market. In our cross-border payments \nbusiness, the majority of revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enables customers to make cross-currency \npayments. Our cross-border payments business also derives revenue from our risk management business, which aggregates \nforeign currency exposures arising from customer contracts and economically hedges the resulting net currency risks by \nentering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties.\n Our performance obligation in our foreign \nexchange payment services is providing a foreign currency payment to a customer’s designated recipient and therefore, we \nrecognize revenue on foreign exchange payment services when the underlying payment is made\n. We also generate float revenue \nearned on invested customer funds in jurisdictions where permitted. \nIn our Lodging Payments segment, we primarily earn revenue from the difference between the amount charged to the customer \nand the amount paid to the hotel for a given transaction or based on commissions paid by hotels. We may also charge fees for \naccess to the network and ancillary services provided.\nThe remaining revenues represent other solutions in our Gift and Payroll card businesses, referred to as Other. In these \nbusinesses, we primarily earn revenue from the processing of transactions. We may also charge fees for ancillary services \nprovided\n.\nRevenues, net, by Geography \nRevenues, net by geography for the years \nended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, were as follows \n(in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenues by Geography*\nRevenues,\nnet\n% of total\nrevenues, net\nRevenues,\nnet\n% of total\nrevenues, net\nUnited States\n$\n2,078.6\n52\n%\n$\n2,045.2\n54\n%\nBrazil\n594.3\n15\n%\n526.1\n14\n%\nUnited Kingdom\n542.0\n14\n%\n478.5\n13\n%\nOther\n759.7\n19\n%\n707.9\n19\n%\nConsolidated revenues, net\n$\n3,974.6\n100\n%\n$\n3,757.7\n100\n%\n*Columns may not calculate due to rounding. \nDisclosure has been conformed in all periods to align with current \npresentation, which is based on the geographic location of the legal entity.\n39\nRevenues, net, by Key Performance Metric and Organic Growth. \nRevenues\n, net by key performance metric and organic \ngrowth by segment for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, were as follows \n(in millions except revenues, net per key \nperformance indicator)*\n:\nAs Reported\nPro Forma and Macro Adjusted\n2\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n% Change\n2024\n2023\nChange\n% Change\nVEHICLE PAYMENTS\n'\n- Revenues, net\n$2,008.8\n$2,005.5\n$3.3\n—%\n$2,075.3\n$1,968.5\n$106.7\n5%\n'\n- Transactions\n820.7\n648.6\n172.1\n27%\n820.7\n768.1\n52.6\n7%\n'\n- Revenues, net per transaction\n$2.45\n$3.09\n$(0.64)\n(21)%\n$2.53\n$2.56\n$(0.03)\n(1)%\n'\n- Tag transactions\n3\n86.5\n79.6\n6.9\n9%\n86.5\n79.6\n6.9\n9%\n'\n- Parking transactions\n249.0\n68.0\n181.0\nNM\n249.0\n226.0\n22.9\n10%\n'\n- Fleet transactions\n444.8\n477.4\n(32.6)\n(7)%\n444.8\n422.0\n22.8\n5%\n'\n- Other transactions\n40.6\n23.7\n16.9\n71%\n40.6\n40.5\n0.1\n0%\nCORPORATE PAYMENTS\n'\n- Revenues, net\n$1,221.9\n$981.1\n$240.8\n25%\n$1,220.3\n$1,017.1\n$203.2\n20%\n'\n- Spend volume\n$170,432\n$145,571\n$24,862\n17%\n$170,432\n$148,759\n$21,673\n15%\n'\n- Revenues, net per spend $\n0.72%\n0.67%\n0.04%\n6%\n0.72%\n0.68%\n0.03%\n5%\nLODGING PAYMENTS\n'\n- Revenues, net\n$488.6\n$520.2\n$(31.6)\n(6)%\n$488.4\n$520.2\n$(31.8)\n(6)%\n'\n- Room nights\n37.7\n36.5\n1.2\n3%\n37.7\n36.5\n1.2\n3%\n'\n- Revenues, net per room night\n$12.97\n$14.25\n$(1.28)\n(9)%\n$12.96\n$14.25\n$(1.29)\n(9)%\nOTHER\n1\n'\n- Revenues, net\n$255.3\n$250.9\n$4.4\n2%\n$255.2\n$250.9\n$4.4\n2%\n'\n- Transactions\n1,574.1\n1,417.7\n156.4\n11%\n1,574.1\n1,417.7\n156.4\n11%\n'\n- Revenues, net per transaction\n$0.16\n$0.18\n$(0.01)\n(8)%\n$0.16\n$0.18\n$(0.01)\n(8)%\nCORPAY CONSOLIDATED \nREVENUES, NET\n'\n- Revenues, net\n$3,974.6\n$3,757.7\n$216.9\n6%\n$4,039.2\n$3,756.7\n$282.5\n8%\n1\n Other includes Gift and Payroll Card operating segments. \n2 \nSee heading entitled \"Managements' Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of pro forma and macro \nadjusted revenue by product and metric non-GAAP measures to the comparable financial measure calculated in accordance \nwith GAAP.

Relevant KPI is derived by broad product \ntype and may differ from how we describe the business. Revenue per KPI per customer may change as the level of services we \nprovide to a customer increases or decreases, as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and \ncustomer rates. See “Results of Operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction.\nOrganic revenue growth is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance. Organic revenue growth is \ncalculated as revenue growth in the current period adjusted for the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment (to \ninclude fuel price, fuel price spreads and changes in foreign exchange rates) over revenue in the comparable prior period \nadjusted to include or remove the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures and non-recurring items that have occurred \nsubsequent to that period. See the heading entitled “Management’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more \ninformation and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure \n40\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that organic revenue growth on a macro-neutral and consistent acquisition/\ndivestiture/non-recurring item basis is useful to investors for understanding the performance of Corpay. \nSources of Expenses\nWe routinely incur expenses in the following categories:\n \n•\nProcessing\n—Our processing expenses consist of expenses related to processing transactions, servicing our customers \nand merchants, credit losses and cost of goods sold related to our hardware and card sales in certain businesses.\n•\nSelling\n—Our selling expenses consist primarily of wages, benefits, sales commissions (other than merchant \ncommissions) and related expenses for our sales, marketing and account management personnel and activities.\n•\nGeneral and administrative\n—Our general and administrative expenses include compensation and related expenses \n(including stock-based compensation and bonuses) for our employees, finance and accounting, information \ntechnology, human resources, legal and other administrative personnel. Also included are facilities expenses, third-\nparty professional services fees, travel and entertainment expenses and other corporate-level expenses.\n•\nDepreciation and amortization\n—Our depreciation expenses include depreciation of property and equipment, \nconsisting of computer hardware and software (including proprietary software development amortization expense), \ncard-reading equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles and buildings and leasehold improvements related to office space. \nOur amortization expenses include amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships, trade \nnames and trademarks, software and non-compete agreements. We are amortizing intangible assets related to business \nacquisitions and certain private label contracts associated with the purchase of accounts receivable.\n•\nOther operating, net\n—Our other operating, net includes other operating expenses and income items that do not relate \nto our core operations or that occur infrequently. \n•\nOther expense (income), net\n—Our other expense (income), net includes gains or losses from the following: foreign \ncurrency \ntransactions\n, extinguishment of debt and investments. This category also includes other miscellaneous non-\noperating costs and revenue. Certain of these items may be presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of \nIncome. \n•\nInterest expense, net\n—Our interest expense, net includes interest expense on our outstanding debt, interest income on \ncash balances and interest on our interest rate and cross-currency swaps.\n•\nProvision for income taxes\n—Our provision for income taxes consists of corporate income taxes related primarily to \nprofits resulting from the sale of our products and services on a global basis.\nFactors and Trends Impacting our Business\nWe believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance:\n \n•\nGlobal economic conditions\n—Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally, \nin North America, Brazil, the U.K. and in other locations internationally. Factors affected by the economy include our \ntransaction volumes, the credit risk of our customers and changes in tax laws across the globe. These factors affected \nour businesses in each of our segments.\n•\nForeign currency changes\n—Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency \nexchange rates; namely, by movements of the Australian dollar, \nBrazilian real\n, British pound, Canadian dollar, Czech \nkoruna, euro, Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar and Russian ruble (for periods prior to the disposition \nof\n our Russia \nbusiness), relative to the U.S. dollar. Approxi\nmately \n52%\n and \n54%\n of our revenues in \n2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively, \nwere derived in U.S. dollars and were not affected by foreign currency exchange rates. See “Results of Operations” for \ninformation related to foreign currency impact on our total revenues, net.\nOur cross-border foreign risk management business aggregates foreign currency exposures arising from customer \ncontracts and economically hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with \nestablished financial institution counterparties. These contracts are subject to counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk \nfrom collateral calls.\nWe further manage the impact of economic changes in the value of certain foreign-denominated net assets by utilizing \ncross currency interest rate swaps. See \"Liquidity and capital resources\" below for information regarding our cross \ncurrency interest rate swaps.\n•\nFuel prices\n—Our Vehicle Payments customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the \npurchase of fuel. Accordingly, our revenue is affected by fuel prices, which are subject to significant volatility. A \nchange in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease or increase in our revenue from several sources, including fees paid \nto us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase. Changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact \nunpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts. We estimate approxim\nately \n8%\n \na\nnd\n \n10%\n of revenues, net were directly impacted by changes in fuel price in \n2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively. See \"Results of \nOperations\" for information related to the fuel price impact on our total revenues, net. \n41\n•\nFuel price spread volatility\n—A portion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel price \nspreads, which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the \nmerchant for the same transaction. In these transactions, the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost \nof fuel. The merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including, among others, the factors \ndescribed above affecting fuel prices. The fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors \nincluding, among others, the fuel price paid to the merchant, posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices. We \nexperience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the \nfuel price we charge to our customers, or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the \nmerchant’s wholesale cost of fuel. The inverse of these situations produces fuel price spread expansion. We estimate \napproximately \n5%\n of revenues, net were directly impacted by fuel price spreads in both \n2024\n and \n2023\n. See \"Results \nof Operations\" for information related to the fuel price impact on our total revenues, net.  \n•\nAcquisitions\n—Since 2002, we have completed over 100 acquisitions of companies and commercial account \nportfolios. Acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy, and it is our intention to continue to seek \nopportunities to increase our customer base and diversify our service offering through further strategic acquisitions. \nThe impact of acquisitions has, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations and may \nmake it difficult to compare our results between periods.\n•\nInterest rates\n—\nFrom January 1, 2023 to July 27, 202\n3, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee increased the target \nfederal funds rate four times for a total rate increase of 1.00%, and on September 18, 2024, November 7, 2024 and \nDecember 18, 2024, lowered the target federal funds rate by 0.50%, 0.25% and 0.25%, respectively. Additional rate \nchanges are possible in future periods. We are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our debt, particularly \nin rising interest rate environments, which is partially offset by incremental interest income earned on cash and \nrestricted cash. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we have a number of receive-variable SOFR, pay-fixed interest rate swap \nderivative contracts with a cumulative notional U.S. dollar value of \n$4.5 billion\n. The objective of these contracts is to \nreduce the variability of cash flows in the previously unhedged interest payments associated with variable rate debt, \nthe sole source of which is due to changes in SOFR benchmark interest rate. \nSee the \"Liquidity and capital resources\" section below for additional information regarding our derivatives.  \n•\nExpenses\n—Over the long term, we expect that our expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as our revenues \nincrease, except for expenses related to transaction volume processed. To support our expected revenue growth, we \nplan to continue to incur additional sales and marketing expense by investing in our direct marketing, third-party \nagents, internet marketing, telemarketing and field sales force.\n•\nIncome \nTaxes\n—We pay taxes in various taxing jurisdictions, including the U.S., most U.S. states and many non-U.S. \njurisdictions. The tax rates in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions are different than the U.S. tax rate. Consequently, as our \nearnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions, our effective tax rate fluctuates. Our effective tax rate is also subject to \nfluctuations driven by the impact of discrete tax items.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), continues to put forth various initiatives, \nincluding Pillar Two rules which introduce a global minimum tax at a rate of 15%. European Union member states \nagreed to implement the OECD’s Pillar Two rules with effective dates of January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025 for \ndifferent aspects of the directive, and most have already enacted legislation. A number of other countries are also \nimplementing similar legislation. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, based on the countries in which we do business that have \nenacted legislation effective January 1, 2024, the impact of these rules to our \nfinancial\n statements was not material. \nThis may change as other countries enact similar legislation and further guidance is released. We are currently \nevaluating the impact of the enacted legislation effective January 1, 2025 to our financial statements and continue to \nclosely monitor regulatory developments to assess potential impacts.\n42\nAcquisitions, Investments and Dispositions\nEach of these acquisitions provide incremental geographic expansion of our product\ns \nand broaden our strategies within each of \nour business segments.  \n20\n25\n•\nI\nn February 2025, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire \n100%\n of Gringo, a leading Brazil-based vehicle \nregistration and compliance payment \ncompany\n, for approximately \n$147.0 million\n, net of cash of approximately $22 \nmillion\n. Gringo's digital app and national network help drivers in Brazil pay vehicle taxes, registration and fines. The \ntransaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approval and standard closing \nconditions and will be reflected in our Vehicle Payments segment.\n20\n24\n•\nIn March 2024, we acquired 70% \nof\n Zapay, a Brazil-based digital mobility solution for paying vehicle-related taxes \nand compliance fees, for approximately \n$59.5 million\n, net of cash. As part of the agreement, we have the right to \nacquire the remainder of Zapay in four years. The majority investment in Zapay further scales our Vehicle Payments \nbusiness in Brazil.\n•\nIn July 2024, we acquired 100% of Paymerang, a U.S. based leader in accounts payables automation solutions, for \napproximately \n$179.2 million\n, net of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired of \n$309 million\n. The \nacquisition expands our presence in several market verticals, including education, healthcare, hospitality and \nmanufacturing. Results from Paymerang are reported in our Corporate Payments segment.\n•\nIn December 2024, we \nacquired\n 100% of GPS Capital Markets, LLC (\"GPS\") for approximately \n$576.2 million\n, \nnet \nof \ncash and cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired of \n$190.7 million\n. GPS provides business-to-business cross-\nborder and treasury management solutions to upper middle market companies, primarily in the U.S. Results from GPS \nare reported in our Corporate Payments segment.\n•\nIn December 2024, we disposed of our merchant solutions business for \n$185.5 million\n, net of cash disposed. Results \nfrom our merchant solutions business were previously included in our Vehicle Payments segment. \n•\nDuring the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we also completed asset acquisitions for approximately \n$6.7 million\n.\n2023\n•\nIn January 2023, we acquired Global Reach, a U.K.-based cross-border payments provider, for approximately \n$102.9 million\n, net of cash. Results from \nGlobal Reach\n are reported in our Corporate Payments segment. \n•\nIn February 2023, we acquired the remainder of Mina Digital Limited, a cloud-based electric vehicle (EV) charging \nsoftwa\nre platfo\nrm, and we also acquired Business Gateway AG, a European-based vehicle maintenance provider, for a \ntotal of approximately $23.8 million, \nnet of cash. \nResults from Mina Digital Limited and Business Gateway AG are \nreported in our Vehicle Payments segment.\n•\nIn September 2023, we acquired PayByPhone Technologies, Inc. a global parking payment application, for \napproximately \n$301.9 million\n, net of cash. Results from PayByPhone are reported in our Vehicle Payments segment.\n•\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we disposed of our Russian business for \n$197.0 million\n, net of cash disposed and net of a \n$5.6 million\n foreign exchange loss upon the conversion of the ruble-denominated proceeds to U.S. dollars. Results \nfrom our Russian business were previously included in our Vehicle Payments segment.\n43\nResults of Operations\nYear ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n \nThe following table sets forth selected financial information from the consolidated statements of income for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n (in millions, except percentages)*.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, \n2024\n% of Total\nRevenue\nYear Ended \nDecember 31, \n2023\n% of Total\nRevenue\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n% Change\nRevenues, net:\nVehicle Payments\n$\n2,008.8\n50.5\n%\n$\n2,005.5\n53.4\n%\n$\n3.3\n0.2\n%\nCorporate Payments\n1,221.9\n30.7\n%\n981.1\n26.1\n%\n240.8\n24.5\n%\nLodging Payments\n488.6\n12.3\n%\n520.2\n13.8\n%\n(31.6)\n(6.1)\n%\nOther\n255.3\n6.4\n%\n250.9\n6.7\n%\n4.4\n1.8\n%\nTotal revenues, net\n3,974.6\n100.0\n%\n3,757.7\n100.0\n%\n216.9\n5.8\n%\nConsolidated operating expenses:\nProcessing\n869.1\n21.9\n%\n819.9\n21.8\n%\n49.2\n6.0\n%\nSelling\n380.9\n9.6\n%\n340.2\n9.1\n%\n40.7\n12.0\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n616.9\n15.5\n%\n603.4\n16.1\n%\n13.5\n2.2\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n351.1\n8.8\n%\n336.6\n9.0\n%\n14.5\n4.3\n%\nGoodwill impairment\n90.0\n2.3\n%\n—\n—\n%\n90.0\nNM\nOther operating, net\n0.8\n—\n%\n0.8\n—\n%\n—\nNM\nGain on disposition of business\n(121.3)\n(3.1)\n%\n—\n—\n%\n(121.3)\nNM\nOperating income\n1,787.2\n45.0\n%\n1,656.9\n44.1\n%\n130.3\n7.9\n%\nInvestment loss (gain)\n0.2\n—\n%\n(0.1)\n—\n%\n0.4\nNM\nOther expense (income), net\n13.7\n0.3\n%\n(16.6)\n(0.4)\n%\n(30.3)\nNM\nInterest expense, net\n383.0\n9.6\n%\n348.6\n9.3\n%\n34.4\n9.9\n%\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n5.0\n0.1\n%\n—\n—\n%\n5.0\nNM\nProvision for income taxes\n381.4\n9.6\n%\n343.1\n9.1\n%\n38.3\n11.2\n%\nNet income\n1,003.7\n25.3\n%\n981.9\n26.1\n%\n21.8\n2.2\n%\nLess: Net loss attributable to \nnoncontrolling interest\n(14)\nNM\n—\n—\n%\n—\nNM\nNet income attributable to Corpay\n$\n1,003.7\n25.3\n%\n$\n981.9\n26.1\n%\n$\n21.9\n2.2\n%\nOperating income (loss) by \nsegments:\nVehicle Payments\n$\n1,076.9\n$\n943.4\n$\n133.5\n14.1\n%\nCorporate Payments\n498.4\n382.1\n116.3\n30.4\n%\nLodging Payments\n223.4\n254.3\n(30.9)\n(12.1)\n%\nOther\n(11.5)\n77.1\n(88.6)\nNM\nTotal operating income\n$\n1,787.2\n$\n1,656.9\n$\n130.3\n7.9\n%\n*The sum of the columns and rows may not calculate due to rounding. \nNM - not meaningful\nConsolidated revenues, net\nConsolidated revenues were \n$3,974.6 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n5.8%\n compared to the prior year.

This growth was \npartially offset by approximately \n$81 million\n, or \n2%\n, \nfrom\n the dispositions of \nour Russia business in August 2023 and our merchant solutions business in December 2024, and by the negative impact of the \nmacroeconomic environment. \n44\nAlthough we cannot precisely measure the impac\nt of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative \nimpact of approximately \n$65 million\n on our consolidated revenues for \n2024\n over \n2023\n, driven primarily by unfavorable foreign \nexchange rates of approximately \n$41 million\n, mostly in our Brazil business, the unfavorable impact of fuel prices of \napproximately \n$14 million\n and unfavorable fuel price spreads of approximately \n$10 million\n. \nConsolidated operating expenses \nProcessing.\n Processing expenses were \n$869.1 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n6.0%\n compared to the prior year. \nIncreases\n in \nprocessing expenses \nwere primarily due to \na\npproximately \n$43 million\n of expenses r\nelated to acquisitions completed in 2023 and \n2024,\n \nhigher variable expenses driven by increased transaction volumes and investments to drive future growth. The increases \nwere partially offset by \nlower credit losses\n of \n$21 million\n due to our shift away from micro-SMB (small-medium business) \nclients in the U.S., the impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $11\n.0 \nmillion\n and the combined impact of \nthe \ndispositions\n of our Russia and merchant solutions businesses\n of approximately \n$4 million\n.\nSelling.\n Selli\nng expenses were \n$380.9 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n12.0%\n compared to the prior year. \nIncreases\n in selling \nexpen\nses were primarily due to increased commissions from higher sales volume and approximately \n$18 million\n of expenses \nrelated to acquisitions completed in 2023 and 2024. The increases were partially offset by\n the impact of \nthe dispositions of our \nRussia and \nmerchant solutions\n businesses\n of approximately \n$5 million\n and the impact of foreign exchange rates of \napproximately $3 million. \nGeneral and administrative.\n General and administrative expenses were \n$616.9 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n2.2%\n compared \nto the prior year. \nIncreases\n in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to approximately \n$28 million\n of expenses \nrelated to acquisitions completed in 2023 and 2024 and higher stock-based compensation expense of approximately \n$5 million\n. \nThese increases were partially offset by \nlower overhead expense due to disciplined expense management, the impact of the \ndispositions of our Russia and merchant solutions businesses of approximately \n$6 million\n and the impact of foreign exchange \nrates of approximately $2 million. \nDepreciation and amortization.\n Depreciation and amortization expenses were \n$351.1 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n4.3%\n. \nIncreases\n in depreciation and amortization expenses were primarily due to incremental investments in capital expenditures in \naddition to approximately \n$18 million\n of expenses related to \nacquisitions completed in 2023 and 2024. These increases were \npartially offset by the impact of the dispositions of our Russia and merchant solutions businesses of approximately \n$3 million\n \nand the impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $4 million. \nGoodwill impairment.\n During \n2024\n, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of \n$90.0 million\n, representing a partial \nimpairment of the goodwill within our Payroll Card reporting unit, which is a component of our \"Other\" \ncategory\n. See \nadditional discussion regarding this impairment, including factors leading to this conclusion, in the \"Critical accounting \nestimates\" section below. \nGain on disposition of business.\n During \n2024\n, we recognized a net gain of \n$121.3 million\n related to the December 2024 \ndisposal of our merchant solutions business, a non-core business within the U.S. division of our Vehicle Payments segment.\nConsolidated operating income\nOperating income was \n$1,787.2 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n7.9%\n compared to the prior year. The \nincrease\n in operating \nincome was primarily due to the reasons discussed above.\nOther \nexpense\n (income), net.\n Other expense, net was \n$13.7 million\n in \n2024\n, which primarily represents the impact of \nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates on non-functional currency balances.\n Other income, net was \n$16.6 million\n in \n2023\n, which \nwas primarily the net gain of approximately \n$13.7 million\n resulting from the disposal of our Russia business during the third \nquarter of 2023. \nInterest expense, net. \nInterest expe\nnse was \n$383.0 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n9.9%\n compared to the prior year. The \nincrease\n in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings for acquisitions and share \nrepurchases and lower interest income due to the sale of our Russia business. The following table sets forth the weighted \naverage interest rates paid on borrowings under our Credit Facility, excluding the related unused facility fees and swaps.\n \n(Unaudited)\n2024\n2023\nTerm loan A\n6.64\n%\n6.49\n%\nTerm loan B\n6.95\n%\n6.84\n%\nRevolving line of credit A & B (USD)\n6.60\n%\n6.51\n%\nRevolving line of credit B (GBP)\n6.60\n%\n5.83\n%\n45\nWe have a portfolio of interest rate swaps which are designated as cash flow hedges and cross-currency interest rate swaps, \nwhich are designated as net investment hedges. During the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, as a result of these swap \ncontracts and net investment hedges, we recorded a benefit to interest expense, net of approximately \n$60.1 million\n and \n$48.4 \nmillion\n, respectively.\nProvision for income taxes. \nT\nhe provision for income taxes and effective tax rate were \n$381.4 million\n and \n27.5%\n in \n2024\n, \ncompared to \n$343.1\n million and \n25.9%\n in the \nprior\n year. The increase in the provision for income taxes was driven primarily by \nan increase in uncertain tax positions, an increase in valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses, the tax effect of a \nnondeductible goodwill impairment and fewer foreign tax benefits. The increases were partially offset by an increase in excess \ntax benefits on stock option exercises and state tax planning impacts. \nNet income attributable to Corpay. \nFor the reasons discussed above, our net income attributable to Corpay was \n$1,003.7 \nmillion\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n2.2%\n compared to the prior year.\nSegment Results\nVehicle Payments\nVehicle Payments revenues were relatively flat at \n$2.0 billion\n in \n2024\n. Vehicle Payments revenues increased primarily due to \norganic growth of \n5%\n driven by new sales growth, and the impact of acquisitions, which contributed approximately \n$44 million\n \nin revenues. These increases were partially offset by the \ndispositions\n of our Russia and merchant solutions businesses in August \n2023 and December 2024, respectively, which lowered revenues by approximately \n$81 million\n, and the negative impact of the \nmacroeconomic environment of approximately\n \n$67 million\n. The negative macroeconomic environment was driven primarily by \nunfavorable \nchanges in foreign exchange rates on revenues of \n$43 million\n, unfavorable fuel prices of \n$14 million\n and \nunfavorable fuel price spreads of approximately \n$10 million\n.\nVehicle Payments operating income was \n$1,076.9 million\n in \n2024\n, an increase of \n14.1%\n compared to the prior year \ndue to the \nreasons \ndiscussed\n above, as well as lower credit losses of\n approximately $26 \nmillion\n, \nas we shifted away from micro-SMB \nclients toward higher credit quality customers in the U.S. in 2023. \n \nCorporate Payments\nCorporate Payments revenues were \n$1,221.9 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n24.5%\n compared to the prior year. \nCorporate \nPayments revenues increased primarily due to organic revenue growth of \n20%\n, driven by a \n15%\n growth in spend volume and \nstrong new sales in our payables and cross-border solutions. The Paymerang and GPS acquisitions contributed approximatel\ny \n$36 million\n in revenue.\nCorporate Payments operating income was \n$498.4 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n30.4%\n compared to the prior year. Corporate \nPayments operating income and margin increased primarily \ndue to the reasons discussed above, as well as operating leverage \nand integration synergies, as revenues grew faster than expenses, partially offset by higher selling expenses to grow the \nbusiness.\nLodging Payments\nLodging Payments revenues were \n$488.6 million\n in \n2024\n, \na decrease\n of \n6.1%\n compared to the prior year. The decrease in \nLodging Payments revenues was primarily \ndue to commissions recognized in the prior year in our insurance business that did \nnot recur in 2024\n, a decline in room nights in our airline and insurance businesses and a decline in revenue per room night in \nour workforce business from the prior year.\nLodging Payments operating income was \n$223.4 million\n in \n2024\n, \na decrease\n of \n12.1%\n compared to the prior year. \nLodging \nPayments operating income and margin declined from the prior period due to the reasons discussed above.\nOther \nOther revenues were \n$255.3 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n of \n1.8%\n compared to the prior year. Other operating loss was \n$11.5 \nmillion\n in \n2024\n as compared to operating income of \n$77.1 million\n in the prior year. The Other operating loss in \n2024\n was \ndriven by a \n$90.0 million\n non-cash goodwill impairment recorded in 2024. Excluding this non-cash loss, operating income and \nmargin for the Other segment increased primarily due to our operating leverage and disciplined expense management.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness, make acquisitions of businesses and commercial \naccount portfolios, repurchase shares of our common stock and meet working capital, tax and capital expenditure needs.\nSources of liquidity.  \nWe believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, Securitization \nFacility and other facilities (each discussed below), together with expected future cash flows from operations, will be sufficient \nto meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for at least the next 12 months and into the foreseeable \nfuture, based on our current assumptions. \nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had approximately $2.1 billion in total liquidity, \nconsisting of approximately $0.5 billion available under our Credit Facility (defined below) and unrestricted cash of \n$1.6 \nbillion\n, a portion of which includes customer deposits or is required for working capital and regulatory purposes. \nRestricted \ncash primarily represents customer deposits repayable on demand held in certain geographies with legal restrictions, customer \n46\nfunds held for the benefit of others, collateral received from customers for cross-currency transactions in our cross-border \npayments business, which is restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits and to secure and settle cross-currency \ntransactions, and collateral posted with banks for hedging positions in our cross-border payments business. \nWe also utilize the Securitization Facility to finance a portion of our domestic receivables, to lower our cost of borrowing and \nmore efficiently use capital. Accounts receivable collateralized within our Securitization Facility relate to trade receivables \nresulting primarily from charge card activity in Vehicle Payments and Corporate Payments and receivables related to our \nLodging Payments business in the U.S. We also consider the available and undrawn amounts under our Securitization Facility \nand Credit Facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had no \nadditional liquidity under our Securitization Facility. \nWe have determined that outside basis differences associated with our investments in foreign subsidiaries would not resu\nlt in a \nmaterial deferred tax liability, and, consistent with our assertion that these amounts continue to be indefinitely invested, have \nnot recorded incremental income taxes for the additional outside basis differences. \nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n.\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,940.6\n$\n2,101.1\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(807.5)\n$\n(380.7)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n405.0\n$\n(898.2)\nOperating activities.\n Net cash provided by operating activities was \n$1,940.6 million\n in \n2024\n, a decrease from \n$2,101.1 million\n \nin \n2023\n. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily driven by changes in working capital.\nInvesting activities.\n Net cash used in investing activities was \n$807.5 million\n in \n2024\n, an increase from \n$380.7 million\n in \n2023\n. \nThe increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to incremental spending on acquisitions completed in \n2024\n \nover the comparable period in \n2023\n. Additionally, our capital expenditures were \n$175.2 million\n in \n2024\n, \nan increase\n \nof \n$21.4 \nmillion\n, or \n14%\n, from \n$153.8 million\n in \n2023\n due to the impact of acquisitions and continued investments in technology.\nFinancing activities.\n Net cash provided by financing activities was \n$405.0 million\n in \n2024\n compared to net cash used in \nfinancing activities of \n$898.2 million\n in \n2023\n. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2024 was primarily due to (i) net \nborrowings on our Credit Facility and Securitization Facility of \n$1,271.2 million\n during \n2024\n as compared to net repayments of \n$322.4 million\n during \n2023\n and (ii) an increase in proceeds of \n$314.5 million\n from common stock resulting from stock option \nexercises, partially offset by increased outflows for repurchases of common stock of \n$601.1 million\n in \n2024\n versus \n2023\n.\nCredit \nFacility\nCorpay Technologies Operating Company, LLC, and certain of our domestic and foreign owned subsidiaries, as designated co-\nborrowers (the “Borrowers”), are parties to a \n$7.5 billion\n Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), with Bank of America, \nN.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and a syndicate of financial institutions (the \n“Lenders”), which has been amended multiple times. \nThe Credit Agreement provides for senior secured credit f\nacilities \n(collectively, the \"Credit Facility\") consisting of a revolving credit facility in the amount of \n$1.8 billion\n, a Term Loan A facility \nin the amount of \n$3.3 billion\n (\"Term Loan A\") and a Term Loan B facility in the amount of \n$2.4 billion\n (\"Term Loan B\") as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n. The revolving credit facility consists of (a) a revolving A credit facility in the amount of \n$1.3 billion\n with \nsublimits for letters of credit and swing line loans and (b) a revolving B facility in the amount of \n$500 million\n with borrowings \nin U.S\n. dollars, euros, British pounds, Japanese yen or other currency as agreed in advance and a sublimit for swing line loans. \nThe Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature for borrowing an additional \n$750 million\n in Term Loan A, Term Loan \nB, revolving A or revolving B facility debt and an unlimited amount when the leverage ratio on a pro-forma basis is less than \n3.75\n to 1.00. Procee\nds from the credit facilities may be used for working capital purposes, acquisitions and other general \ncorporate purposes. The maturity date for the Term Loan A and revolving credit facilities A and B is \nJune 24, 2027\n. The Term \nLoan B has a maturity date of April 30, 2028. \nOn May 3, 2023, the Company entered into the thirteenth amendment to the Credit Facility. The amendment replaced LIBOR \non the Term Loan B with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus a SOFR adjustment of \n0.10%\n.\nOn January 31, 2024, we entered into the fourteenth amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment a) increased the \ncapacity on the revolving credit facility by $275.0 million and b) increased the Term Loan A commitments by $325.0 million. \nWe used the Term Loan A proceeds to pay down existing borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As a result, the \ntransaction was leverage neutral and results in a $600 million increase in our availability under the revolving credit facility. The \ninterest rates and maturity terms remain consistent with the existing credit facilities.\n47\nOn September 26, 2024, we entered into the fifteenth amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment a) increased the \nTerm Loan B commitments by $500 million and b) removed the SOFR adjustment margin of 0.10% from the calculation of \ninterest on Term Loan B borrowings. We used the Term Loan B proceeds to pay down existing borrowings under the revolving \ncredit facility. The maturity dates and the interest rates for \nthe\n revolving credit facility and Term Loan A commitments were \nunchanged by this amendment.\nOn \nFebruary 20, 202\n5, we entered into the sixteenth amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment increased the Term \nLoan B commitments by an incremental \n$750 million\n. We used t\nhe \nTerm Loan B proceeds to pay down existing borrowings \nunder the revolving credit facility and other general corporate purposes. The maturity dates and the interest rates for the Credit \nAgreement were unchanged by this amendment.\nInterest on amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrues \nas follows: for all loans denominated in U.S. dollars with \nthe exception of Term Loan B borrowings, based on SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10%; for Term Loan B borrowings, \nbased on SOFR; for all loans denominated \nin British pounds, based on the SONIA plus a SONIA adjustment of \n0.0326%\n; for \nall loans denominated in euros, based on the \nEuro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR)\n; or for all loans denominated in \nJapanese yen, at the Toyko Interbank Offer Rate (TIBOR) plus a margin based on a leverage ratio (as defined in the \nagreement); or our option (for U.S. dollar borrowings only), the Base Rate (defined as the rate equal to the highest of (a) the \nFederal Funds Rate plus \n0.50%\n, (b) the prime rate announced by Bank of America, N.A., or (c) SOFR plus \n1.00%\n plus a margin \nbased on a leverage ratio). In addition, we pay a quarterly commitment fee at a rate per annum ranging from \n0.25%\n to \n0.30%\n of \nthe daily unused portion of the credit facility.\nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the interest rate on the Term Loan A was \n5.83%\n, the interest rate on the Term Loan B was \n6.11%\n, the \ninterest rate on the revolving A and B facilities (USD borrowings) was \n5.83%\n, and the interest rate on the revolving B facility \n(GBP borrowings) was \n6.11%\n. The unused credit facility fee was \n0.25%\n for all revolving facilities at \nDecember 31, 2024\n. \nThe term loans are payable in quarterly installments due on the last business day of each March, June, September and \nDecember with the final principal payment due on the respective maturity date. Borrowings on the revolving line of credit are \nrepayable at the maturity of the facility. Borrowings on the domestic swing line of credit are due on demand, and borrowings on \nthe foreign swing lines of credit are due no later than \ntwenty\n business days after such loan is made. \nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of Corpay and its \ndomestic subsidiaries, pursuant to a security agreement and includes a pledge of (i) 100% of the issued and outstanding equity \ninterests owned by us of each Domestic Subsidiary and (2) 66% of the voting shares of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries, but \nexcluding real property, personal property located outside of the U.S., accounts receivables and related assets subject to the \nSecuritization Facility and certain investments required under money transmitter laws to be held free and clear of liens. \nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had \n$3.1 billion\n in borrowings outstanding on Term Loan A, net of discounts, \n$2.3 billion\n in \nborrowings outstanding on Term Loan B, net of discounts and \n$1.3 billion\n in borrowings outstan\nding on the revolving credit \nfacility. We have unamortized debt issuance costs of \n$3.4 million\n related to the revolving credit facility as of \nDecember 31, \n2024\n recorded in other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance \ncosts of \n$16.6 million\n related to the term loans as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n recorded in notes payable and other obligations, net of \ncurrent portion within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance \ncosts, the effective interest rate incurred on the term loan\ns was \n6.87%\n during \n2024\n. \nDuring the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we made borrowings of \n$825.0 million\n on the term loans, principal payments of \n$140.1 million\n on the term loans and net borrowings of \n$570.3 million\n on the revolving facilities.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we were in compliance with each of the covenants under the Credit Agre\nement.\nSecuritization Facility\nWe are a party to a \n$1.7 billion\n receivables purchase agreement among Corpay Funding LLC, as seller, PNC Bank, National \nAssociation as administrator, and various purchaser agents, conduit \npurchasers\n and related committed purchasers parties thereto \n(the \"Securitization Facility\") as of December 31, 2024. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the interest rate on the Securitization Facility \nwas \n5.36%\n. \nOn January 24, 2025, we entered into an omnibus amendment to our Securitization Facility. The amendment increased the \nSecuritization Facility commitment from \n$1.7 billion\n to \n$1.8 billion\n and extended the maturity of the Securitization Facility \nfrom August 18, 2025 to January 24, 2028. \nThe omnibus amendment also reduced the program fee by 5 bps to SOFR plus \n0.10% adjustment plus 0.90% or the Commercial Paper Rate plus 0.80% and decreased the unused facility fee by 5 bps for two \nof the purchasers.\nThe Securitization Facility provides for certain termination events, which includes nonpayment, upon the occurrence of which \nthe administrator may declare the facility termination date to have occurred, may exercise certain enforcement rights with \nrespect to the receivables and may appoint a successor servicer, among other things. \nWe were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenant requirements related to our Securitization Facility as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n.\n48\nOther Facilities\nWe carefully monitor and manage initial \nand\n variation margin requirements for our cross-border solutions, which can result in \ntransitory periods of elevated liquidity needs in cases where the currency market experiences disruption. In order to help \nmitigate that liquidity risk, we have entered into facilities intended to provide additional means to manage working capital \nneeds for our cross-border solutions. \nWe have three unsecured overdraft facilities with a combined capacity of $155.0 million, which may be accessible via written \nrequest and corresponding authorization from the applicable lenders. There is no guarantee the uncommitted capacity will be \navailable to us on a future date. Interest on drawn balances accrues under the agreements at either (a) a fixed rate equal to the \nlender's reference rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the respective agreements) plus 1% or (b) SOFR plus \n1.25%. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had no borrowings outstanding under the uncommitted credit facilities. \nWe also have a 364-day committed revolving credit facility with a total commitment of $70.0 million and maturity date of \nFebruary 20, 2026. Borrowings under this facility will bear interest at the borrower's option at a rate equal to (a) Term SOFR \n(as defined in the agreement) plus 1.25% or (b) the Base Rate (determined by reference to the greatest of (i) the Federal Funds \nEffective Rate, at that time, plus 0.50%, (ii) the Prime Rate, at that time, and (iii) Term SOFR (as defined in the agreement) at \nsuch time plus 1.00%). As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facility. \nCash Flow Hedges\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had the following outstanding interest rate swap derivatives that qualify as hedging instruments \nwithin designated cash flow hedges of variable interest rate risk (in millions):\nNotional Amount \nWeighted Average \nFixed Rate\nMaturity Date\n$500\n4.01%\n7/31/2025\n$500\n3.80%\n1/31/2026\n$1,500\n4.15%\n7/31/2026\n$750\n4.14%\n1/31/2027\n$500\n4.19%\n7/31/2027\n$250\n4.00%\n1/31/2028\n$500\n3.19%\n7/31/2028\nThe purpose of these contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows in interest payments associated with $4.5 billion of \nunspecified variable rate debt, the sole source of which is due to changes in the SOFR benchmark interest rate. For each of \nthese swap contracts, we pay a fixed monthly rate and receive one month SOFR.\nOur cash flow hedges resulted in a reduction to interest expense, net of \n$46.3 million\n and \n$39.4 million\n during the \nyears\n ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively\n.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps that are designated as net investment hedges of our investments in foreign-\ndenominated operations. Such contracts effectively convert the U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts to obligations \ndenominated in the respective foreign currency and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on such foreign-\ndenominated net investments. These contracts also create a positive interest differential on the U.S. dollar-denominated portion \nof the swaps, resulting in interest rate savings on the USD notional.\nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had the following cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges of our \ninvestments in foreign-denominated operations:\nU.S. dollar equivalent \nnotional (in millions)\nFixed Rates\nMaturity Date\nEuro (EUR)\n$500\n2.15%\n5/26/2026\nCanadian Dollar (CAD)\n$800\n1.14%\n5/20/2026\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n$750\n0.317%\n5/8/2028\n49\nHedge effectiveness is tested based on changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps due to changes in the USD/foreign \ncurrency spot rates. We anticipate perfect effectiveness of the designated hedging relationships and record changes in the fair \nvalue of the cross-currency interest rate swaps associated with changes in the spot rate through accumulated other \ncomprehensive loss. Excluded components associated with the forward differential are recognized directly in earnings as \ninterest expense, net. We recognized a benefit of \n$13.9 million\n and \n$9.0 million\n in \ninterest\n expense, net for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively, related to these excluded components. \nIn \nJanuary\n 2025, we terminated our existing CAD cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges and \nsubsequently entered into four new cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges of our investments in \nCAD-denominated operations. These contracts effectively convert an aggregate $800 million of U.S. dollar equivalent to an \nobligation denominated in CAD and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on our CAD-denominated net \ninvestments. These contracts also create a positive interest differential on the U.S. dollar-denominated portion of the swap, \nresulting in a weighted average interest rate savings of 1.35% on the USD notional.\nAcquisition\nI\nn February 2025, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire \n100%\n of Gringo, a leading Brazil-based vehicle registration and \ncompliance payment company, for approximately \n$147.0 million\n, net of cash of approximately \n$22 million\n. Gringo's digital app \nand national network help drivers in Brazil pay for vehicle taxes, registration and fines. The transaction is expected to close in \nthe first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approval and standard closing conditions and will be reflected in our Vehicle \nPayments segment.\nStock Repurchase Program\nGiven our returns on our capital investments and significant cash provided by operations, management believes it is prudent to \nreinvest in the business to drive profitable growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders over time through \nstock repurchases. \nOur Board of Directors (the \"Board\") has approved a stock repurchase program (as updated from time to \ntime, the \"Program\") authorizing us to repurchase our common stock from time to time until February 4, 2026. On January 25, \n2024, the Board authorized an increase to the aggregate size of the Program by $1.0 billion to $8.1 billion, and on November 4, \n2024, the Board authorized an increase to the aggregate size of the Program by $1.0 billion to $9.1 billion. \nSince the beginning \nof the Program through \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we have repurchased \n33,090,680\n shares for an aggregate purchase price of \n$7.8 \nbillion\n, leaving us up to \n$1.3 billion\n of remaining authorization available under the Program for future repurchases in shares of \nour common stock. We repurchased \n4,211,818\n common shares totaling \n$1.3 billion\n in \n2024\n; \n2,597,954\n common shares totaling \n$0.7 billion\n in \n2023\n and \n6,212,410\n common shares totaling \n$1.4 billion\n in \n2022\n.\nAny stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate. The timing and amount of stock \nrepurchases, if any, will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory \nrequirements, and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess. Any repurchases have been \nand are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business, working capital and debt.\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Uses of Cash\nMaterial cash requirements primarily consist of debt obligations and related interest payments, along with lease obligations.  \nSee Note 11 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Form 10-K for further information.\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n were approximately \n$439.2 million\n.\n See Note 13 to the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements within this Form 10-K for further information. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on \ntemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable \namounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these \ncalculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, \nscheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments du\ne by period could be misleading, as this scheduling would not relate to \nliquidity needs. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had approximately \n$95.5 million\n of unreco\ngnized income tax benefits related to \nuncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. We \ndo not expect reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of \nincome tax uncertainties. \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make \naccounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Some of these estimates \nrequire us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base \nthese assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under \nthe circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. In many instances, however, we \nreasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could \noccur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our \nfinancial condition or results of operations. We refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical \n50\naccounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our \nconsolidated financial statements.\nFor a discussion of our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements \nwithin this Form 10-K for further information.\nFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses. \nOur current expected credit loss methodology for measurement of credit losses on \nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replaces the previous incurred loss impairment methodology. Our financial \nassets subject to credit losses are primarily trade receivables. We utilize a combination of aging and loss-rate methods to \ndevelop an estimate of current expected credit losses, depending on the nature and risk profile of the underlying asset pool, \nbased on product, size of customer and historical losses. Expected credit losses are estimated based upon an assessment of risk \ncharacteristics, historical payment experience and the age of outstanding receivables, adjusted for forward-looking economic \nconditions. The allowances for remaining financial assets measured at amortized cost basis are evaluated based on underlying \nfinancial condition, credit history and current and forward-looking economic conditions. The estimation process for expected \ncredit losses includes consideration of qualitative and quantitative risk factors associated with the age of asset balances, \nexpected timing of payment, contract terms and conditions, changes in specific customer risk profiles or mix of customers, \ngeographic risk, economic trends and relevant environmental factors. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements \nwithin this Form 10-K for further information.\nImpairment of goodwill \nand indefinite-lived assets\n. \nWe \ncomplete\n an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more \nfrequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting \nunit level. When we believe it is appropriate, we may elect to first perform the optional qualitative assessment for certain of our \nreporting units. Factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and \nmarket conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the \ncomposition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant \nentity-specific events. If we elect to bypass the optional qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative \nfactors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be \nrequired. We then perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for the applicable reporting units by comparing the \nreporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value, which is measured based upon, among other factors, a \ndiscounted cash flow analysis and, to a lesser extent, market multiples for comparable companies. If the carrying amount of the \nreporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized.\nWe also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade names) for impairment annually. We test for \nimpairment at an interim date if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an \nindefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recorded if the carrying amount of an \nindefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.\nGlobally we face uncertainties and risks related to economic factors in the countries we have operations. As a result, we make \nassumptions that involve significant judgment about future uncertainties when performing impairment tests of goodwill and \nindefinite-lived intangible assets. Both of these impairment tests involve the use of critical accounting estimates. Depending on \nthe test/model, factors and estimates used to estimate the fair value\n include:\n i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and \namortization (EBITDA) margin and growth, and ii) the discount rates for the goodwill impairment test; and i) the discount rates \nand ii) royalty rates used for indefinite-lived \nintangible\n assets test. The variability of these estimates and assumptions depends \non a number of conditions which could change our conclusion at each reporting period. As these factors are often \ninterdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is meaningful to estimate and disclose the impact of \nchanging a single factor. If our assumptions and estimates change between a current period impairment test and a prior period \nimpairment test, impairment losses could result. If we were to use different assumptions or consider different trends in future \nperiods, impairment losses may also result. The total future impairment losses, if required, may be material.\nAs of October 1, 2024, as a result of our annual evaluation, we determined the goodwill within the Payroll card reporting unit, a \ncomponent of our “Other” category, was partially impaired. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of \n$90 \nmillion\n within goodwill impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nFactors that led to this conclusion included i) decreased use of the card and its core component for our target customers, ii) the \nimpact of historic and sustained increases in inflation and interest rates on the reporting unit’s weighted average costs of capital \nwhich was beyond our control, and iii) inability to achieve forecasted operating results at historical underwritten values, all of \nwhich resulted in revised mid to long-term projections during the fourth quarter of 2024, including reevaluation of the \nCompany's anticipated capital investment in the reporting unit and which negatively impacted the reporting unit's fair value. We \nengaged the assistance of a third-party valuation firm to assist us with the performance of our goodwill quantitative impairment \ntest. The estimation of the net present value of future cash flows is based upon varying economic assumptions, including \nassumptions such as revenue, net growth rates, operating costs, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, tax rates, long-term \ngrowth rates and discount rates. As it relates to the Payroll card reporting unit, of these \nassumptions\n, EBITDA margins and \ndiscount rates are the most sensitive, subjective and/or complex. These assumptions are based on risk-adjusted discount factors \naccommodating viewpoints that consider the full range of variability contemplated in the current and potential future economic \nsituations. There is approximately \n$57 million\n of goodwill remaining related to the Payroll card reporting unit following this \nimpairment. The results of our 2024 impairment test for our reporting units other than Payroll card indicated that the estimated \nfair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of the corresponding carrying amount as of October 1, and no impairment \nof goodwill existed.\n51\nIn September 2023, we acquired PayByPhone Technologies, Inc., a global parking payment application, for approximately \n$301.9 million\n, net of cash. Results from PayByPhone are reported in our Vehicle Payments segment. We allocated \napproximately \n$11 million\n to the PayByPhone trade name with a residual value of approximately \n$207 million\n allocated to \ngoodwill for the PayByPhone reporting unit. If the near-term operating results do not meet or exceed our current financial \nprojections, or if conditions change causing, for example, the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the \nresults of the PayByPhone business, it is possible that we would be required to recognize an impairment loss as the fair value of \nthe reporting unit currently exceeds the carrying value by less than 20%, due to the standalone nature of the business and recent \ntiming of the acquisition. We will continue to monitor the operating results and the fair value of this reporting in future periods.\nSee Note 2 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements within this Form 10-K for further information.\nIncome taxes. \nOur annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we \noperate. Significant judgment is required in estimating our annual income tax expense and annual effective rate through the \nrealizability of our deferred tax assets, our income tax positions and related reserves and the recording of certain deferred tax \nliabilities related to foreign investments.\nThe ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon the existence and timing of reversal of temporary differences, \nthe ability to carryback income to open years and where allowed, the implementation of tax planning strategies and the \ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible.\nDetermining future taxable income requires us to estimate the amount of income subject to tax in future periods which includes: \ni) estimating revenue, revenue growth rates, Earnings and Interest Before Income Taxes and expenses by tax jurisdiction by \nexamining\n historical results and considering current/future trends as well as scheduling out the timing of temporary items, ii) \nfactoring in adjustments for any known future changes in tax law/regulations, iii) the potential impact of any reasonable tax \nplanning strategies, and iv) estimating the future impact of complex material deductions. We record a valuation allowance \nwhere we determine that it is not more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the entire tax benefit associated with the \nrelated deferred tax asset. \nWe estimate income tax-related reserves to reduce tax benefits from any income tax positions where we believe the benefit \nfrom the tax position once taken on the tax return is uncertain such that it is more likely than not to be upheld by the tax \nregulatory body but for an amount less than the benefit taken. When determining whether the full amount of the income tax \nposition will be upheld/sustained, we consider whether the technical merits of the position are supported by regulations, court \nruling, current legislation and other relevant authoritative guidance. \nWe include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense. See Note 13 to our Consolidated \nFinancial \nStatements\n within this Form 10-K for further information.\nBusiness combinations (valuation of intangible assets). \nAcquired assets and liabilities assumed, including contingencies, \nthrough a business combination are recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date. The estimates we use to \ndetermine the fair value of intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to \nus to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value \ndetermination of significant acquired assets. The estimated fair values of customer-related and contract-based intangible assets \nare generally determined using the income approach, which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value \nusing discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows. The discount rates used represented a risk \nadjusted market participant weighted-average cost of capital, derived using customary market metrics. These measures of fair \nvalue also require considerable judgments about future events, \nincluding forecasted customer attrition rates\n. Acquired \ntechnologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method, which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an \nasset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis, with adjustments in value for physical \ndeterioration and functional and economic obsolescence. \nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, \nour estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up \nto one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Upon the conclusion \nof the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also \nestimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the period over which to recognize the amount of acquisition-related \nintangible assets as an expense. Certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives. We periodically review the \nestimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be \nappropriate. Refer to Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements within this Form 10-K for further information.\nManagement\n’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \nWe have included in the discussion below certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Any \nanalysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. \nBelow, we define the non-GAAP financial measures, provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most \ndirectly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and discuss the reasons that we believe this \ninformation is useful to management and may be useful to investors. Because our non-GAAP financial measures are not \nstandardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies using \n52\nthe same or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Although management uses these non-GAAP measures to set goals and \nmeasure performance, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are presented \nsolely to permit investors to more fully understand how our management assesses underlying performance. These non-GAAP \nmeasures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with our \nGAAP financial statements and financial measures. As a result, such non-GAAP measures have limits in their usefulness to \ninvestors.\nWe have defined the non-GAAP measure adjusted net income attributable to Corpay as net income attributable to Corpay, as \nreflected in our statement of income, adjusted to eliminate (a) non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to stock-\nbased compensation awards, (b) amortization of deferred financing costs, discounts, intangible assets, amortization of the \npremium recognized on the purchase of receivables and amortization attributable to the Company's noncontrolling interest, (c) \nintegration and deal related costs, and (d) \nother non-recurring items, including unusual credit losses\n, certain discrete tax items, \nthe impact of business dispositions, impairment losses, asset write-offs, restructuring costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, \ntaxes associated with stock-based compensation programs, losses and gains on foreign currency transactions and legal \nsettlements and related legal fees. We adjust net income for the tax effect of adjustments using our effective income tax rate, \nexclusive of certain discrete tax items. We calculate adjusted net income attributable to Corpay and adjusted net income per \ndiluted share attributable to Corpay to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating \nperformance. We have defined the non-GAAP measure adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Corpay as the \ncalculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income.\nAdjusted net income attributable to Corpay and adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Corpay are supplemental \nmeasures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net \nincome per diluted share or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash \nshare based compensation expense from adjusted net income because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point \nin time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and share based compensation expense \nis not a key measure of our core operating performance. We also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from \ncompany to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods, the fair value and \naverage expected life of their acquired intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which their assets were \nacquired; therefore, we have excluded amortization expense from our adjusted net income. Integration and deal related costs \nrepresent business acquisition transaction costs, professional services fees, short-term retention bonuses and system migration \ncosts, etc., that are not indicative of the performance of the underlying business. We also believe that certain expenses, certain \ndiscrete tax items, gains on business dispositions, recoveries (e.g., legal settlements, write-off of customer receivable, etc.), \ngains and losses on investments, taxes related to stock-based compensation programs and impairment losses do not necessarily \nreflect how our investments and business are performing. We adjust net income for the tax effect of each of these adjustments \nusing the effective income tax rate during the period, exclusive of certain discrete tax items. \nOrganic revenue growth is calculated as revenue growth in the current period adjusted for the impact of changes in the \nmacroeconomic environment (to include fuel price, fuel price spreads and changes in foreign exchange rates) over revenue in \nthe comparable prior period adjusted to include or remove the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures and non-recurring \nitems that have occurred subsequent to that period. We believe that organic revenue growth on a macro-neutral and consistent \nacquisition/divestiture/non-recurring item bases is useful to investors for understanding the performance of Corpay. \nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, interest expense, net, other expense (income), depreciation and \namortization, goodwill impairment, loss on extinguishment of debt, investment loss/gain and other operating, net. Adjusted \nEBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for a material modification impacting\n stock-based compensation expense\n and a \ndeal related termination expense. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are defined as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a \npercentage of revenue.\nManagement uses adjusted net income attributable to Corpay, adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Corpay,\n \norganic revenue growth, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\n \n•\nas measurements of operating performance because they assist us in comparing our operating performance on a \nconsistent basis; \n•\nfor planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget;\n \n•\nto allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; and\n \n•\nto evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies.  \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Revenue and Key Performance Metric by Segment to GAAP\n.
