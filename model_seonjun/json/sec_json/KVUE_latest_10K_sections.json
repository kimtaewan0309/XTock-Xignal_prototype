  "item1": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nAt Kenvue, our purpose is to realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. As a global leader at the intersection of healthcare and consumer goods, we are the world’s largest pure-play consumer health company by revenue with $15.5 billion in Net sales in the fiscal year 2024. By combining the power of science with meaningful consumer insights and our digital strategy, we empower consumers to live healthier lives every day. Built on more than a century of heritage and trusted by generations, our differentiated portfolio of iconic brands—including Tylenol\n®\n, Neutrogena\n®\n, Listerine\n®\n, Johnson’s\n®\n, BAND-AID\n®\n Brand, Aveeno\n®\n, Zyrtec\n®\n, and Nicorette\n®\n—is backed by science and recommended by healthcare professionals, which further reinforces our consumers’ connections to our brands.\nOur portfolio includes Self Care, Skin Health and Beauty, and Essential Health products, allowing us to connect with consumers across North America, Asia Pacific (“APAC”), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Latin America (“LATAM”)—in their daily rituals and the moments that matter most. Our products are marketed across more than 165 countries worldwide. Our global scale and the breadth of our brand portfolio are complemented by our well-developed capabilities and accelerated through our digital strategy, allowing us to dynamically capitalize on and respond to current trends impacting our categories and geographic markets. \nWith a sole focus on consumer health, our marketing organization operates efficiently by leveraging our precision marketing, e-commerce, and broader digital capabilities to develop unique consumer insights and further enhance the relevance of our brands. Similarly, our research and development organization combines these consumer insights with deep, multi-disciplinary scientific expertise, and engagement with healthcare professionals, to drive innovative new products, solutions, and experiences centered around consumer health.\nUnderpinned by Kenvue’s Healthy Lives Mission, our comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) strategy, our core capabilities are supported by our commitment to building a resilient and sustainable business that creates value for all our stakeholders over the long term.\nSince the Separation (as defined below) from J&J, as described below, we have been executing a significant transformation agenda, spanning from exiting the Transition Services Agreement (as defined in “Risk Factors—Summary of Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Relationship with J&J” in Part I, Item 1A) while standing up, modernizing, and optimizing our own systems, to instituting a new operating model, as we reinvent our ways of working and strengthen and scale our commercial capabilities. We have been focused on driving productivity and realizing Our Vue Forward (as defined in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Restructuring,” in Part II, Item 7) and other cost savings across the organization to fuel investments behind our brands, so that we can drive sustainable and profitable growth.\nSeparation from J&J\nIn November 2021, J&J, our former parent company, announced its intention to separate its Consumer Health segment (the “Consumer Health Business”) into an independent publicly traded company (the “Separation”). Kenvue was incorporated in Delaware in February 2022, as a wholly owned subsidiary of J&J, to serve as the ultimate parent company of J&J’s Consumer Health Business. In April 2023, J&J completed the transfer of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Consumer Health Business to us and our subsidiaries. In May 2023, we completed an initial public offering (the “Kenvue IPO”) of approximately 10.4% of our outstanding common stock and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “KVUE.” Following the Kenvue IPO, J&J owned approximately 89.6% of our outstanding common stock. In July 2023, J&J announced an exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”) under which its shareholders could exchange shares of J&J common stock for shares of our common stock owned by J&J. In August 2023, J&J completed the Exchange Offer and exchanged shares representing 80.1% of our common stock, completing the Separation from J&J and transition to being a fully independent public company. In May 2024, J&J completed an additional exchange offer (the “Debt for Equity Exchange”) through which J&J exchanged indebtedness of J&J for shares of our common stock owned by J&J. Following the completion of the Debt for Equity Exchange, J&J no longer owned any shares of our common stock. See Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Description of the Company and Business Segments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\n5\nRelationship with J&J\nWe entered into a separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) and various other agreements with J&J for the purpose of effecting the Separation. These agreements provide a framework for our relationship with J&J and govern various interim and ongoing relationships between us and J&J that follow the completion of the Kenvue IPO. See Note 12, “Relationship with J&J,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on these agreements.\nBrands and Product Portfolio\nWe have a world-class, global portfolio of iconic and trusted brands that are leaders in their respective categories and include some of the most recognizable household names across the consumer health industry. Our overall strategy prioritizes operating our portfolio in a highly targeted manner, with the goal of delivering sustainable and profitable growth.\nEach of our reportable business segments are focused on driving financial performance by leveraging specific category expertise and capabilities while also benefiting from our scale to collaborate across the organization, including in brand management and marketing, research and development and innovation, insights and analytics, and omnichannel commerce. The reportable business segments are as follows:\n•\nSelf Care. \nOur Self Care product categories include: Pain Care; Cough, Cold, and Allergy; and Other Self Care (Digestive Health, Smoking Cessation, Eye Care, and Other). Major brands in the segment include Tylenol\n®\n, Motrin\n®\n, Nicorette\n®\n,\n \nBenadryl\n®\n, Zyrtec\n®\n, Zarbee’s\n®\n, ORSL\nTM\n, Rhinocort\n®\n, and Calpol\n®\n. Our Self Care brands offer accessibility to healthcare solutions with over-the-counter (“OTC”) medicines and other naturally inspired products. These brands deliver connected health offerings, including digital diagnostics and telemedicine, to expand personalized solutions to consumers.\n•\nSkin Health and Beauty.\n Our Skin Health and Beauty product categories include: Face and Body Care; and Hair, Sun, and Other. Major brands in the segment include Neutrogena\n®\n, Aveeno\n®\n, Dr.Ci:Labo\n®\n, OGX\n®\n, Le Petit Marseillais\n®\n, Lubriderm\n®\n, and Rogaine\n®\n. Our portfolio of skin and hair care brands focus on dermatological solutions by leveraging partnerships with skin experts and scientific expertise to create differentiated, science-backed products recommended by healthcare professionals.\n•\nEssential Health. \nOur Essential Health product categories include: Oral Care; Baby Care; and Other Essential Health (Women’s Health, Wound Care, and Other). Major brands in the segment include Listerine\n®\n, Johnson’s\n®\n, BAND-AID\n® \nBrand, Stayfree\n®\n, o.b.\n®\n tampons, Carefree\n®\n, and Desitin\n®\n. Our Essential Health brands raise standards of personal care across baby care, wound care, oral care, and menstrual health categories.\nBrand Marketing\nOur digital approach to marketing places the consumer at the center of all decisions related to our product delivery, service offerings, and the experiences we create. Our global presence allows us to tailor our marketing strategy and campaigns to the distinctive needs of our consumers in local markets throughout the world. It is our global scale and improving modern marketing capabilities that enable deep connections with consumers. In 2024 we created the Global Content Factory, a production agency ecosystem that we employ to drive relevant content in all of our markets while reducing our costs.\nWe leverage insights across our product offerings to understand the constantly changing consumer behaviors and expectations, which allow us to evolve our brand messaging to ensure that we drive relevance with consumers and healthcare professionals, ultimately seeking to increase reach, stimulate demand, and drive growth. Our marketing expertise is built on a combination of human empathy and science that improves health outcomes.\nOur consumer-first approach and rigorous clinical testing allows us to articulate science in ways that meet the needs of our consumers and healthcare professionals as we win their trust, endorsement, and loyalty.\nWe are a digital modern marketing company and we collaborate with celebrities, influencers, and healthcare professionals to amplify brand awareness and product innovations.\nIn addition, we continually evaluate the impact of media investments and consumer communications through data science and analytics. We ultimately use media return on investment to evaluate and optimize our investment opportunities. Our digital strategy aims to maximize reach, performance, and returns while reducing costs.\n6\nProduct Development and Innovation\nOur research and development organization combines multi-disciplinary scientific expertise with active engagement with healthcare professionals, placing human empathy at the core of our product development process. We leverage our extensive capabilities and deep consumer insights to develop innovative products and experiences that meet the specific needs of our consumers, enhancing their overall standard of everyday care.\nAcross our portfolio of iconic brands, we earn consumers’ trust through modern, science-backed innovations that deliver reliable, personal care products and technologies that improve well-being.\nOur global team of approximately 1,600 scientists, doctors, pharmacists, and engineers with expertise across a range of core disciplines, including formulation science, regulatory affairs, quality, medical affairs, medical safety, clinical operations, microbiology, translational science, and packaging. Our research and development organization operates a global network of innovation hubs located close to consumers in key geographic markets.\nOur global research and development teams collaborate across the product development lifecycle, partnering with consumers and leveraging our long-standing relationships with healthcare professionals and academic institutions to co-create a continuous pipeline of meaningful innovation.\nWe have built extensive capabilities through our translational science and consumer insights teams to understand the key needs and current challenges of our consumers and healthcare professionals, ensuring our products are centered around human empathy. Throughout our end-to-end organization, we have continuous touchpoints with our consumers and healthcare professionals, utilizing a suite of digital tools to ensure we hear from them regardless of their location. Our insights, design, marketing, and research teams then leverage these consumer insights to identify key unmet needs and potential product opportunities.\nSupply Chain and Manufacturing\nOur global and balanced manufacturing footprint provides us with the flexibility and agility to benefit from economies of scale and global supply chain agreements, enabling us to grow our business and expand margins. We are continuously modernizing and optimizing our supply chain operations while better connecting with and serving our customers. Our end-to-end, digitally connected supply chain ecosystem is designed to optimize the flexibility and agility of our route-to-market. Reliability and resiliency remain our priority throughout our fit-for-purpose supply chain, ensuring that we can deliver our products to our customers and consumers whenever and wherever they need them.\nOur supply chain network is purpose-built to deploy resources across the globe where they are most needed. Our sourcing, manufacturing, and demand planning capabilities are continuously optimized to meet evolving market dynamics. Our extensive distribution network and sales organization enable us to establish strategic partnerships with key suppliers and retailers across multiple markets and channels, where we further leverage our scale to drive flexible manufacturing capacity and supply chain optimization. We believe this approach builds and supports our resilience across economic cycles and allows us to prioritize or expand our geographic focus based on our strategic priorities.\nSources and Availability of Materials \nWe maintain global operations and work with a vast supplier base. The principal raw materials used in our products include resins, silicon, pulp and corn derivatives, paper, agrochemicals, vegetable oils, and oleochemicals. The majority of raw and packaging materials used are purchased from third parties and available from several sources. We do purchase certain raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers; however, no single supplier provides a significant portion of our total material requirements. Certain raw and packaging material commodities are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n—\nVolatility in the cost or availability of raw materials and other inputs for our products, including due to military conflicts, has adversely affected, and could in the future continue to adversely affect us.”\nManufacturing Footprint\nOur in-house manufacturing footprint delivered over 60% of our sales volume during the fiscal year 2024, with the remaining sales volume being supplied by an extensive network of external manufacturing facilities operated by trusted third-party \n7\nsuppliers. This combination provides us with significant operational flexibility enhancing our ability to respond to demand while optimizing capital allocation.\nWarehousing and Distribution Capabilities\nOur distribution network is designed to respond to increasingly complex consumer and customer demand. The majority of our distribution centers are operated in partnership with expert third-party operators in order to leverage their scale, expertise, and technology platforms. In all cases, whether in-house or external, our distribution centers must comply with our rigorous quality compliance standards and are subject to our audit process.\nQuality Control and Compliance\nWith a rigorous approach to product safety and quality control, we have a strong culture of quality across our end-to-end organization enhanced by rigorous compliance procedures. We invest in quality systems and data analytics platforms to further drive proactive quality management and improve the effectiveness of our quality control system.\nSuppliers are key partners in our commitment to quality and therefore are expected to provide services and goods that consistently meet our quality standards. In order to ensure compliance with our high-quality standards, we conduct regular quality audits of our supplier base and their facilities.\nOur supply chain is also subject to external audits by national regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which conduct multiple regulatory inspections every year.\nCompetition\nThe consumer health and personal care sectors are large and dynamic, with a significant number of competitors that vary from well-established consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) companies with well-known legacy businesses globally to emerging niche-oriented brands.\nGiven the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint, we compete with a broad set of competitors that include 1) consumer healthcare businesses that are either independent or part of larger pharmaceutical groups, 2) global CPG companies that operate in similar or adjacent categories, 3) regional companies that operate in our categories within the markets in which we compete, 4) generic OTC manufacturers and retailers’, including our customers’, private-label brands in both traditional retail and online, and 5) emerging niche-oriented brands in our categories with distribution either through traditional retail, online, or direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels. Across our three reportable business segments, we experience significant degrees of competition.\nOur key competitors for each segment globally include:\n•\nSelf Care.\n Haleon, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser Group, and private-label brands\n•\nSkin Health and Beauty\n. Beiersdorf, Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and private-label brands\n•\nEssential Health\n. Church & Dwight, Colgate-Palmolive, Kimberly Clark, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and private-label brands\nSee Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information on our competitive risks.\nHealthy Lives Mission\nOur ESG management approach is designed to effectively govern and manage impacts and risks while also enabling us to identify opportunities that accelerate innovation and profitable growth and drive business value for all our stakeholders. Our Healthy Lives Mission, which is our ESG strategy, includes public goals and commitments intended to position our brands as more positive choices for both people and the planet and to help manage ESG-related impacts, risks, and opportunities. Kenvue’s Healthy Lives Mission is our call for everyday care in action and is supported by three pillars: nurture Healthy People, enrich a Healthy Planet, and maintain Healthy Practice. Within these three pillars, we are focused on nine priority areas for which we have established goals and commitments to hold ourselves accountable and demonstrate progress as outlined in our Healthy Lives Mission Report.\nWe will continue to provide more details about our progress against these goals and commitments in our upcoming Healthy Lives Mission Report. For more information on our climate-related risks and opportunities informed by the recommendations \n8\nof the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), see our inaugural TCFD Report, which will be reviewed and updated periodically. Our Healthy Lives Mission Report and TCFD Report are available at \nkenvue.com/our-commitments\n. References to our Healthy Lives Mission Report or TCFD Report are for informational purposes only, and neither the Healthy Lives Mission Report, TCFD Report, nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance Practices\nOur Board of Directors (the “Board”) has adopted Principles of Corporate Governance that, together with our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Board Committee charters, provide a framework for our Board’s corporate governance practices. In addition, among other policies, our Board has adopted a Kenvue Code of Conduct designed to provide employees with guidance on our compliance policies and a Code of Business Conduct & Ethics for Members of our Board of Directors and Executive Officers that sets forth additional guidelines applicable to members of our Board and Kenvue’s executive officers, both of which can be found on our website at \ninvestors.kenvue.com/governance/governance-documents/\n.\nHuman Capital\nCompany Culture\nAt Kenvue, we strive to build a culture of performance that rewards impact. We are united by a common Purpose to realize the extraordinary power of everyday care and anchored in our core values: 1) we put people first, 2) we care fiercely, 3) we earn trust with science, and 4) we solve with courage. We strive to provide an environment where every employee (or Kenvuer) can be at their best, do meaningful work in service of our customers and consumers, be inspired by a strong sense of belonging and meaningful growth opportunities, and be rewarded for their impact.\nOur People\nAs of December 29, 2024, we had approximately 22,000 employees, with approximately \n25%\n located in North America, 28% in EMEA, 28% in APAC, and 19% in LATAM. Approximately 99% of our global employees were full time and 1% were part-time employees. Our global workforce covers a broad range of functions, including manufacturing employees making up 23% of our workforce.\nAt Kenvue, we believe everyday care is for everyone, everywhere. We recognize the importance of innovation in our industry to meet the evolving needs of our consumers globally, and we remain focused on having the right capabilities and a workforce that is reflective of the global consumers we serve. We believe that capitalizing on a multitude of perspectives helps us drive innovation and deliver solutions that exceed customer expectations and creates long-term value. Our Code of Conduct specifically articulates our responsibility to create an inclusive environment and to respect the dignity and differences of all people. We foster an inclusive and trusting workplace that allows each Kenvuer to maximize contributions to their work, the company culture, and their communities. \nOur talent practices aim to drive higher levels of transparency, empowerment, and accountability that enables superior performance through high levels of engagement. For example, we have initiatives in place to help ensure our hiring practices are fair, consistent, objective, and do not discriminate based on any legally protected category, so that our employees design and create everyday care products that are accessible to everyone. We base talent decisions only on merit, considering qualifications, experience, skills, performance, and achievements. Additionally, we nurture a sense of belonging for Kenvuers through numerous employee resource groups known as Kenvuer Impact Networks, mentorship programs, and other initiatives that are open to all Kenvuers. In addition, we offer flexible work arrangements that enable agile ways of working and promote inclusion, health, well-being, empowerment, and accountability.\nLearning and Development\nWe invest in the learning and development of all Kenvuers to ensure their skills remain relevant and keep pace with the rapid evolution in the marketplace. Learning can happen in different ways, including on-the-job, on special assignment, and e-learning or in-classroom training, to develop functional and/or leadership skills. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure this ongoing commitment to development and growth yields superior performance and higher levels of engagement that differentiates us from our competitors.\n9\nEngagement\nWe believe that an engaged workforce is more likely to deliver higher levels of performance and further differentiates us in the marketplace. We believe that open and honest communication among all team members creates a collaborative and inclusive work environment. We regularly conduct surveys that gauge Kenvuer sentiment in areas such as strategic alignment, execution, inclusion, effectiveness of our people leaders, and career development.\nWe also strive to actively support the communities we serve worldwide as well as those in which Kenvuers live and work through strategic investments. Kenvue Cares, our global employee volunteer program, is just one way in which we connect our passionate purpose-driven workforce to fulfill our potential and create possibilities. We make financial contributions, provide in-kind charitable product donations, and volunteer the time of team members to help non-profit organizations achieve their goals and generate societal impact.\nTotal Rewards\nWe offer compensation, benefits, and well-being programs designed to attract, develop, and retain top talent in a highly competitive environment. We reward and recognize superior performance and closely align Kenvuer compensation with company and individual performance. We provide base pay that is competitive for a Kenvuer’s position considering skill level, experience, geographic location, and other business-related factors. In addition to base pay, we seek to motivate and reward Kenvuers with annual cash incentives and equity-based awards, depending on job level. Additionally, we conduct periodic benchmarking and comparative analyses to help ensure Kenvue’s compensation programs remain competitive and that employee pay is appropriate based on skills, expertise, education, and tenure.\nWe offer competitive benefits packages, which vary by country and region, in support of the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of Kenvuers. These benefits packages may include retirement plans, life insurance, medical and dental insurance, health savings accounts, well-being reimbursement programs, adoption assistance, fertility benefits, and parental and family leave.\nWe strive to create an environment where Kenvuers feel a strong sense of belonging, are empowered to care for their health and well-being and that of their families, can grow and have fulfilling careers, and are recognized and valued for their contributions.\nWorkplace Safety\nWe have robust processes to identify potential safety risks associated with workplace activities and to develop measures and implement controls to mitigate possible exposure to hazards. We support Kenvuers with general safety training and have implemented specific programs for those working in potentially high-risk environments.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights, as well as rights to third-party intellectual property pursuant to licenses and other contracts, to establish, maintain, protect, and enforce the intellectual property and other proprietary information used in our business. Establishing, maintaining, protecting, and enforcing our intellectual property and other proprietary rights in the United States and around the world is important to our success, and we consider these rights, in the aggregate, to be material to our business.\nTo facilitate the Separation and enable our operations to continue with minimal interruption following the Separation, J&J has granted licenses to use certain intellectual property rights retained by J&J that we used in the conduct of its business prior to the Separation, including the “Johnson & Johnson” name and signature and other legacy J&J branding, for a limited duration following the Separation. For additional information about these licenses, see the Company’s definitive proxy statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2024 Proxy Statement”).\nOur brands are critical to our success, and trademark protection is an important part of establishing and maintaining brand recognition for our products in the United States and around the world. The vast majority of our Net sales are derived from products bearing proprietary trademarks and trade names. These trademarks and trade names convey that the products we sell are “brand name” products. We seek to obtain protection for these trademarks and trade names by all appropriate means, and we consider them, in the aggregate, to be material to our business. For trademarks registered in the United States, a Declaration of Use must be filed between the fifth and sixth years after initial registration, then may be renewed in the 10th year, and \n10\nrenewed every 10 years after that, so long as the mark is still being used in commerce. Trademarks registered in other countries generally have varying terms and renewal policies.\nWe actively file and maintain a portfolio of patents in the United States and around the world and seek to obtain and enforce patent protection by all appropriate means. While we consider these patents, and the protection thereof, to be important, we do not consider any single patent to be material to the success of our business, and we do not expect the expiration of any single patent to have a material impact on the success of our business. The terms of our issued patents extend for varying periods dependent upon the date of filing and type of patent application and the legal term for patents in the various countries where patent protection is granted.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to extensive government regulations in the United States and around the world. U.S. federal authorities, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), regulate various aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities in other jurisdictions. Government regulations in the United States and around the world apply to many areas of our business, including most aspects of our products. It is our policy and practice to comply with all government regulations applicable to our business. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with applicable national and local regulations in the United States and around the world is complex, time-consuming, and costly and may impact our business strategies. In addition, the global regulatory landscape is subject to rapid and unexpected changes and the general trend toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement around the world in recent years. For additional information about risks associated with government regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings.”\nNew or more stringent laws or regulations, more restrictive interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or increased enforcement actions by governmental and regulatory agencies around the world could increase our ongoing costs of compliance, alter the environment in which we do business, or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have products in a number of different regulatory classifications, and these classifications and their application to our products may vary from market to market. Accordingly, certain of our products are subject to varying levels of regulation in different geographic markets. The following description discusses the material effects of the regulatory landscape applicable to our business, with particular focus on the United States, the European Union (“EU”), and China, which are some of our key geographic markets for our business from a regulatory perspective and markets that we believe are representative of the material differences in the regulation of our business across the various geographic markets in which we operate.\nQuality and Safety\nThe FDA and comparable authorities in other jurisdictions regulate the facilities and operational procedures that we use to manufacture our products. We are required to register our facilities with these authorities. Products are required to be manufactured in our facilities in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) or similar manufacturing standards in each country in which we manufacture products. \nIn addition, many of our products are subject to regulation by the CPSC under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (“PPPA”), the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and other laws enforced by the CPSC. These statutes and related regulations establish safety standards and bans for consumer products. Certain state laws also address the safety of consumer products and may mandate reporting or labeling requirements. Noncompliance with these laws may result in penalties or other regulatory action and related reputational harm.\nDrug Products\nIn order to market and sell a new drug product in the United States, a manufacturer must 1) file a New Drug Application (“NDA”) that shows the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the new drug, 2) file an Abbreviated NDA that demonstrates the equivalence of a generic product to another company’s branded drug product, or 3) comply with the FDA’s monograph system. Most of our OTC products marketed in the United States are regulated pursuant to the FDA’s monograph system. The monographs establish the conditions, such as active ingredients, uses (indications), doses, labeling, and testing, under which an OTC drug is generally recognized as safe and effective and can be marketed without an NDA and FDA premarket approval. Products marketed under the OTC monograph system are required to conform to specific quality, formula, and labeling \n11\nrequirements. Monograph drug products that do not comply with these standards can be deemed unapproved new drugs and can be required to be withdrawn from the market. The Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act (the “OTC Monograph Reform Act”) established an Administrative Order Process for issuing, revising, and amending OTC monographs. Under the OTC Monograph Reform Act, the FDA can also require manufacturers to conduct additional testing to ensure the safety and efficacy of monograph drug products. For example, in September 2021, the FDA issued a Proposed Order Amending the OTC Monograph for Sunscreen Drug Products requiring additional data for certain ingredients to ensure their safety. In addition, certain of our OTC products, including certain Zyrtec\n®\n, Zyrtec-D\n®\n, Pepcid\n®\n, and certain Imodium\n®\n and Motrin\n®\n products, are approved by the FDA through the NDA process rather than through the monograph system.\nIn addition, the DEA regulates certain of our OTC products containing pseudoephedrine (“PSE”), such as Sudafed\n®\n and Zyrtec-D\n®\n, pursuant to the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (“CMEA”). Among other requirements, the CMEA sets daily and 30-day sales limits for PSE products purchased by consumers. We are also subject to similar regulations at the state level. Our OTC products containing PSE are also subject to heightened regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions around the world.\nIn the EU, our OTC products, including certain Nicorette\n®\n products that are not marketed by us in the United States, are subject to extensive pre- and post-marketing regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and EU Member State level. There are several administrative mechanisms to request regulatory approval of OTC products, including 1) the standalone national procedure for authorization in a single EU Member State, 2) the mutual recognition procedure, which is used when a product is already authorized in at least one EU Member State and approval is sought in at least one other EU Member State, and 3) the decentralized procedure, which is used when a product has not yet been authorized in the EU and authorization is sought simultaneously in several EU Member States.\nCertain of our products in certain jurisdictions may be regulated as prescription medications. For example, in the EU medications containing PSE have historically been regulated as OTC products. During the fiscal three months ended December 29, 2024, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France changed the regulatory status of medications containing PSE from OTC to prescription-based.\nIn China, our OTC products are regulated by the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”), which is the primary authority for the safety and registration of medicines, medical devices, and cosmetics.\nCosmetics\nA number of our products marketed in the United States, including many of our products in the Skin Health and Beauty segment, are considered cosmetics regulated by the FDA through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Our cosmetic products include Aveeno\n®\n Restorative Skin Therapy Oat Repairing Cream, Aveeno\n®\n Restorative Skin Therapy Sulfate-Free Body Wash, Johnson’s\n®\n Baby Powder, and certain of our Listerine\n®\n mouthwash products. Cosmetics are not subject to premarket approval by the FDA, but certain ingredients, such as certain color additives, are required to be preauthorized, and the FDA seeks to ensure cosmetic products are not adulterated or misbranded. If the safety of a product or its ingredients has not been adequately substantiated, an appropriate warning label is required to be included on the product. Other warnings may also be mandated pursuant to FDA regulations. The FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products with applicable regulations through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic manufacturers and distributors to ensure that products do not contain false or misleading labeling, are not adulterated, and are not manufactured under unsanitary conditions. Inspections also may arise from consumer or competitor complaints filed with the FDA. In the event that the FDA determines that one of our products fails to comply with FDA regulations, we may be required, or we may independently decide, to conduct a recall or market withdrawal of that product or to correct the failure by making changes to that product, including its manufacturing, formulation, or label. In addition, the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act, enacted in December 2022, is expected to expand the FDA’s regulatory authority over cosmetic products, including by providing the FDA with new mandatory recall authority over cosmetics and by requiring the registration of cosmetic manufacturing facilities, the reporting of certain adverse events, the issuance of cGMP requirements, and the establishment of safety substantiation requirements.\nIn addition, certain of our cosmetic products, including those containing low-viscosity hydrocarbons such as baby oil, are regulated by the CPSC under the PPPA. See “—Quality and Safety” above.\nMedical Devices\nMedical devices are subject to regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Although there is variation among jurisdictions in how our products are classified, medical devices are broadly defined as products which a manufacturer intends \n12\nto be used to treat, cure, prevent, mitigate, or diagnose disease. Medical devices generally achieve their purpose by physical modes of action; the principal intended action may not be pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic.\nCertain of our products marketed in the United States, such as BAND-AID\n®\n Brand Adhesive Bandages (including Ourtone\nTM\n Adhesive Bandages), and Listerine\n®\n Sensitivity Defense Mouthrinse are medical devices regulated by the FDA through a system that, unless exempt, requires us to receive premarket clearance for commercial distribution known as a 510(k) clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a device is required to be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and efficacy to a benchmark device, or “predicate,” that is already legally in commercial distribution. Any modification to a 510(k) cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a change in its intended use generally requires a new 510(k) clearance. If we determine that a new 510(k) clearance is not required but the FDA subsequently disagrees, the FDA may retroactively require us to obtain a new 510(k) clearance and may require us to cease marketing, or conduct a recall, of the modified device until the new 510(k) clearance is obtained.\nIn the EU, manufacturers may self-certify compliance of certain medical devices by submitting notifications to the competent authority, with files open to inspection by a competent authority. In May 2021, the Medical Device Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) (“MDR”) came into effect in the EU. The MDR is more comprehensive than the prior regime as it greatly increases the rigor and robustness of the regulations governing medical device products. All medical devices are expected to meet the MDR requirements, and there is no “grandfathering” of products. In addition, all approved products and their manufacturers are subject to re-review on periodic cycles of up to every four years. In recent years, we have also introduced certain connected health offerings as non-medical device apps, including certain products that are not offered in the United States and, as such, are not regulated as medical devices by the health authorities in the countries in which they are offered. Any determination that medical device clearance is required for a product that we currently offer as a non-medical device may cause us to cease marketing, or conduct a recall, of the modified product until such clearance is obtained.\nIn China, locally manufactured medical devices gain market authorization through municipal authorities, while medical devices that are not manufactured in China are reviewed by the NMPA and must be accompanied by appropriate documentation showing that the device has been approved in its country of origin.\nDietary Supplements\nSome of our products, including those under the Lactaid\n®\n and Zarbee’s\n®\n brands, that are marketed in the United States are considered dietary supplement products and are governed by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which defines and regulates dietary supplements. A comparable regulatory regime operates in the EU, where dietary supplements, including some of our products under the Zarbee’s\n® \nbrand, are regulated as food products pursuant to the Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC. Most EU Member States have implemented notification procedures that require reporting prior to or immediately after the commencement of sales of a dietary supplement.\nLabeling and Product Claims\nWe are subject to various laws on labeling and product claims, including with respect to the characteristics, quality, safety, performance, and benefits of our products. We typically are required to have a reasonable basis to support any factual marketing claims, and what constitutes a reasonable basis for substantiation can vary widely from market to market and from product to product. For example, while cosmetic labeling does not require FDA premarket approval, the FDA regulates cosmetic labeling claims and monitors, and takes action against, claims that are not truthful, are misleading, or make medicinal claims. The FDA is also responsible for taking action against any misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. In addition, while our labeling and advertising claims for our monograph drug products, such as certain Benadryl\n®\n, Tylenol\n®, \nand Neutrogena\n®\n products, and advertising claims for NDA products are not subject to approval by the FDA, labeling claims for our NDA products, such as certain Zyrtec\n®\n, Pepcid\n®\n, Imodium\n®\n,\n \nand Motrin\n®\n products, are approved by the FDA. In certain circumstances, we may also be subject to additional regulations depending on the nature of the labeling and product claims. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture enforces federal standards for organic production and use of the term “organic” on product labeling.\nThe FTC regulates the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising as well as relationships between us, on the one hand, and advertisers and influencers, on the other hand, pursuant to principles described in the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (the “Endorsement Guides”). The Endorsement Guides provide that an endorsement should reflect the honest opinion of the endorser and cannot be used to make a claim about a product that the product’s marketer could not itself legally make. The Endorsement Guides also stipulate that, if there is a connection between an endorser and the marketer that consumers would not expect and this connection would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, then that connection should be disclosed. If our advertising claims or claims made by our social media influencers \n13\nor by other endorsers with whom we have a material connection do not comply with the Endorsement Guides or any requirements of the FTC Act or similar state requirements, then the FTC and state authorities could subject us to investigations and enforcement actions, impose penalties, require us to pay monetary consumer redress, require us to revise our marketing materials, or require us to accept burdensome injunctions, any of which could adversely affect us.\nFurthermore, the National Advertising Division (“NAD”) of the Better Business Bureau administers a self-regulatory program of the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising. NAD monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competitors and consumers. We may also be subject to various state consumer protection laws, including California’s Proposition 65, which requires a specific warning on any product that contains a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.\nIn the EU, advertising of products is subject both to general consumer advertising requirements pursuant to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC), which imposes a general prohibition on misleading and aggressive advertising, as well as more specific regulations in respect of various product classifications. For example, pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC, advertisements of our OTC products must, among other requirements, 1) be set out in such a way that it is clear that the message is an advertisement and that the product is clearly identified as a medicinal product, 2) not refer to claims of recovery in improper, alarming, or misleading terms, and 3) not suggest that the effects of taking the medicine are guaranteed, are unaccompanied by adverse reactions or are better than, or equivalent to, those of another treatment or medicinal product. The EU has also established a legal framework for cosmetic labeling claims based on the Cosmetics Products Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009). So-called “responsible persons” must ensure that a cosmetic product made available on the market is safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions, taking into account presentation, labeling, instructions for use and disposal and any other indication or information provided by the responsible person.\nIn China, advertisements of OTC products must, among other requirements, include an “OTC” marking and must not contain difficult or confusing medical or pharmaceutical terms that could mislead the public about a product’s efficacy or safety.\nPricing\nOur activities are subject to a variety of price control laws and regulations in some of the markets in which we operate. The range and extent of these price control mechanisms vary by market. In addition, price control laws or regulations may become more stringent during times of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions, such as during times of economic slowdown, recession, or inflation.\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety\nThe EPA and parallel state and local authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities around the world, enforce a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products or otherwise operate our business. These include requirements governing product content and labeling; the handling, manufacture, transportation, storage, use, and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials and wastes; the discharge and emission of pollutants; and the cleanup of contamination in the environment. For more information on the broad range of environmental, health, and safety laws that Kenvue is subject to. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\n—\nWe are subject to a broad range of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and the impact of any obligations under these laws and regulations could adversely affect us.”\nWe are also subject to extensive and evolving regulations regarding the manufacturing, processing, distribution, importing, exporting, registration, and labeling of our products and their raw materials. In the EU, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations came into effect in 2007, with implementation rolling out over time. Registered chemicals then can be subject to further evaluation and potential restrictions. Since the promulgation of REACH, other countries have enacted or are in the process of implementing similar comprehensive chemical regulations.\nOur operations are also subject to regulation under OSHA and parallel state and local occupational health and safety standards, as well as occupational health and safety standards applicable to our operations in other jurisdictions. These standards establish certain employer responsibilities, including requirements to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause serious injury or death, certain medical and hygiene standards, licensing, and permitting obligations and various recordkeeping, disclosure, and procedural requirements. \n14\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nWe are subject to increasingly complex and changing privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the United States and around the world that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, transmission, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, retention, availability, integrity, and other processing of health-related and other sensitive and personal information. In the United States, we are subject to a growing number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations, the specific requirements of which vary from state to state. We are also subject to federal health information privacy laws. Outside the United States, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation (“U.K. GDPR”), together with national legislation, regulations, and guidelines of the EU Member States and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, store, transfer, and otherwise process personal data, including health data and adverse event reporting. In China, we are subject to the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), which applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons within China, the processing of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products and services within China, and the analysis or assessment of the activities of individuals within China. While similar to the EU GDPR, the PIPL contains unique requirements not found in the EU GDPR. In addition, we are subject to China’s Cybersecurity Law, which establishes its overall security framework, and China’s Data Security Law, which aims to protect the security of processed data.\nAdditional privacy and data protection laws and regulations are being adopted around the world, including in other jurisdictions in which we operate, and privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows, has increased in recent years. Compliance with these new and changing laws has impacted, and may in the future impact, our business strategies, and unforeseen changes to privacy laws may affect our ability to tailor and personalize our products and services to meet our strategic goals or consumer expectations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAnti-Corruption\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), that generally prohibit companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any improper advantage. Similar to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and Chinese anti-corruption laws, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt behavior. In addition, our interactions and financial relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials (including individuals acting on behalf of hospitals or other institutions owned or controlled by a government body) are subject to varying degrees of regulation and restriction in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations and restrictions are generally intended to protect against corruption and conflicts of interest in connection with the expenditure of government funds and to ensure fairness and transparency in their legislative, regulatory, and procurement processes.\nOther Regulations\nWe are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations in the United States and around the world. For example, we must comply with an increasing number of laws designed to combat abuses of human rights in our value chain. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the United States and around the world. We are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the United States (including those imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other authorities that may prohibit us or our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restrict the type of business that may be conducted by us or our affiliates. For example, actions taken in response to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine (the “Russia-Ukraine War”) have included the imposition of export controls and broad financial and economic sanctions against Russia, Belarus, and specific areas of Ukraine. In addition, we are subject to trade controls (including import and export restrictions, such as tariffs, sanctions, quotas, or trade barriers) imposed by the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Enforcement activities under these laws and regulations could subject us to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies.\nSeasonality\nWhile seasonality has a limited impact on the consolidated Net sales within all three of our reportable segments, we are subject to certain degrees of seasonal sales fluctuations. For example, in our Self Care segment, certain of our OTC products, such as Tylenol\n®\n and Motrin\n®\n, are typically purchased more frequently in preparation for the cold and flu season in the winter or, in the case of Zyrtec\n®\n and Benadryl\n®\n, during high allergy seasons in the spring and the fall. In addition, in our Skin Health and Beauty \n15\nsegment, sales of our products that contain SPF are typically higher in preparation for the summer, and sales of our products that contain moisturizers are typically higher in the fall and the winter. Finally, in our Essential Health segment, certain of our wound care products are typically purchased more frequently in the summer months.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is \nkenvue.com\n.

Kenvue was incorporated in Delaware in February 2022, as a wholly owned subsidiary of J&J, to serve as the ultimate parent company of J&J’s Consumer Health Business. In April 2023, J&J completed the transfer of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Consumer Health Business to us and our subsidiaries. In May 2023, we completed an initial public offering of approximately 10.4% of our outstanding common stock and began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “KVUE.” Following the Kenvue IPO, J&J owned approximately 89.6% of our outstanding common stock.\n \nIn July 2023, J&J announced an exchange offer under which its shareholders could exchange shares of J&J common stock for shares of our common stock owned by J&J. In August 2023, J&J completed the Exchange Offer and exchanged shares representing approximately 80.1% of our common stock, completing the Separation from J&J and transition to being a fully independent public company. In May 2024, J&J completed an additional exchange offer through which J&J exchanged indebtedness of J&J for shares of our common stock owned by J&J. Following the completion of the Debt for Equity Exchange, J&J no longer owned any shares of our common stock.\nSee Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Description of the Company and Business Segments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe are incurring certain non-recurring separation-related costs in connection with our establishment as a standalone public company (the “Separation-related costs”). We expect the Separation-related costs will continue through approximately the first half of fiscal year 2025. For additional information about the Separation, see Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 12, “Relationship with J&J,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nRelationship with J&J\nWe entered into the Separation Agreement and various other agreements with J&J for the purpose of effecting the Separation. These agreements provide a framework for our relationship with J&J and govern various interim and ongoing relationships between us and J&J that follow the completion of the Kenvue IPO. See Note 12, “Relationship with J&J,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on these agreements.\nKenvue Global Headquarters\nOn April 20, 2023, we entered into a long-term lease for a newly renovated global and North America corporate headquarters building and a newly constructed research and development building in Summit, New Jersey. We expect to officially open our new global and North America corporate headquarters in March 2025. The relocation to our new campus from multiple U.S.- based locations will continue through 2026 when the new research and development building is expected to be complete. When construction is completed, the campus will encompass approximately 290,000 square feet. The Global and North America Headquarters Lease collectively includes the lease associated with the global and North America corporate headquarters building, the lease associated with the land where the research and development building is under construction, and the lease associated with land to be used for amenities. \nOn February 21, 2024, we listed our interim corporate headquarters in Skillman, New Jersey for sale, which met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at that date. For the fiscal three months ended March 31, 2024, an impairment charge of $68 million was recorded on the held for sale asset associated with the interim corporate headquarters in Skillman. See Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Assets Held for Sale,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for more information.\n53\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Brands and Product Portfolio\nWe have a world-class, global portfolio of iconic and modern brands, and for over 135 years, we have been making and investing in consumer products that are trusted by generations of consumers. Our business is balanced and resilient with leading brands across categories and geographic markets. Our brands are widely recognized and represent a combination of global powerhouses and regional brands, many of which hold leading positions in their respective categories. Our brands are built for moments that uniquely matter; these moments of care create an emotional connection to our products that creates deep bonds between consumers and our brands.\nConsumers, customers, and third-party partners value and trust the reputation, reliability, and status of our brands and the quality, performance, and functionality of our products, and we believe there are significant opportunities to further increase our category and brand penetration by continuing to deepen our brand relevance and salience across our portfolio, continually earning a place for our products in consumers’ hearts and homes.\nShifting Consumer Preferences\nEveryday care has never been a more essential part of the consumer health journey. Globally, preferences and expectations for consumer health products continue to evolve, with a heightened focus on preventative care and science-backed solutions. Consumers are also shifting the paradigm of beauty towards health. Other recent trends that have affected consumer preferences include an aging population, premiumization (where consumers switch their purchases to premium alternatives), a growing middle class in emerging markets, and the rise of digital ecosystems that create new opportunities for personalized health solutions. We expect these trends to continue and that consumers will continue to seek solutions that meet their health goals, creating growth opportunities across our product portfolio.\nInnovation\nWe rely on science. We have always prioritized science as the core of how we provide care, and we remain committed to this approach. Our ability to quickly develop new products and technologies and to adapt and market our products on an ongoing basis to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential component of our business strategy. Several of our products have a long history of life-enhancing, first-to-market innovations. In many situations, we have driven the innovation and clinical compendium of entire categories. By leveraging world-class research and development capabilities and a team of research and development professionals, we have a multi-disciplinary and differentiated approach to innovation.\nIncreased Competition\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which, in recent years, has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the emergence of retail buying alliances, the rapid growth of e-commerce, and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key customers. One of our customers accounted for approximately 12%, 12%, and 13%\n of total \nNet sales\n for\n the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, respectively. Our top 10 customers represented approximately 41%,\n 41%, and 42% of total \nNet sales\n for the \nfiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, respectively\n. A\ns a result of these trends, certain large-format customers have significant bargaining strength and represent a significant portion of our total Net sales.\nSourcing, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain Management\nOur ability to meet the needs of our consumers and customers depends on the proper functioning of our manufacturing and supplier operations. Our manufacturing operations require the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. We have built our supply chain network to deploy resources across the globe where they are most needed. Our sourcing, manufacturing, and demand planning capabilities are continuously optimized to meet evolving market dynamics. Our extensive distribution network and sales organization enable us to establish strategic partnerships with key suppliers and retailers across multiple markets and channels, where we further leverage our scale to drive flexible \n54\nmanufacturing capacity and supply chain optimization. We believe this approach builds and supports our resilience across economic cycles and allows us to prioritize or expand our geographic focus based on our strategic priorities. \nRestructuring\nAs part of our continued transformation to a fit-for-purpose consumer company, during the fiscal year 2024, we began strategic initiatives intended to enhance organizational efficiencies and better position us for future growth (“Our Vue Forward”). To further Our Vue Forward, on May 6, 2024, our Board approved a multi-year initiative (the “2024 Multi-Year Restructuring Initiative”) to build on our strengths, improve our underlying information technology infrastructure, and optimize our cost structure by rebalancing resources to better position us for future growth. The 2024 Multi-Year Restructuring Initiative primarily includes global workforce reductions, changes in management structure, and the transition to centralized shared-service functions in lower-cost locations. See Note 19, “Restructuring Expenses and Operating Model Optimization Initiatives,”\n \nto the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.\nSupply Chain Optimization Initiatives\nSince 2019, we have taken significant steps to meet consumer demand and mitigate supply chain constraints. We have redesigned our manufacturing and distribution network, optimizing both in-house and external manufacturing and distribution footprints to improve lead time and reliability across the globe. We selectively invested in specific technologies and expanded our capacity in different geographic markets with the intent to increase competitiveness by improving cost, speed, compliance, and customer service. As a result, our historical results of operations reflect savings delivered through these end-to-end supply chain optimization initiatives.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nMacroeconomic factors affect consumer spending patterns and thereby our results of operations. These factors include general economic conditions, inflation, consumer confidence, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, and fuel and energy costs. Factors that impact consumer discretionary spending, which remain volatile globally, continue to create a complex and challenging retail environment for us and our third-party partners. We intend to continue to evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to help mitigate any impacts on our results of operations resulting from broader macroeconomic conditions and policy changes, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business.\nEconomic challenges, including the impact from acts of war, military actions, terrorist attacks, or civil unrest, may continue to cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The impact of these issues may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions and our business, results of operations, or financial condition. \nRussia-Ukraine War \nAlthough the long-term implications of the Russia-Ukraine War are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023 was not significant to our results of operations. For the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, our Ukrainian business represented 0.2%, 0.2%, and 0.1% of our Net sales, respectively. As of both December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Ukrainian business represented 0.1% of our assets. For the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, our Russian business represented 1.1%, 1.0%, and 1.4% of our Net sales, respectively. As of both December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Russian business represented 0.7% of our assets.\nIn the fiscal three months ended April 3, 2022, we announced our decision to suspend supply of all of our products into Russia other than our OTC medicines within our Self Care segment, which we continued to supply as patients rely on many of these products for healthcare purposes. Supply of the suspended products terminated during the fiscal three months ended July 3, 2022. We also suspended branded advertising, clinical trials, and additional investment in Russia. We will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation in Russia and evaluate our activities and future operations in Russia.\nForeign Currency Exposure\nWe report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars but have significant non-U.S. operations. A large portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and generally the applicable local currency is our functional currency in that locality. As a result, we face foreign currency exposure on the translation into U.S. dollars of our results of \n55\noperations in numerous jurisdictions. We manage the impact of foreign exchange rate translation and transaction exposures through operational means and the use of derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts. In addition, as we continue to expand our global operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant, particularly if the U.S. dollar strengthens in the future.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nWe continually assess and refine our portfolio through acquisitions of businesses as well as divestitures of assets that we do not believe are well integrated into our product portfolio and strategic direction. We believe our strong balance sheet will allow us to strategically make acquisitions and divestitures while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation.\nWe did not complete any significant acquisitions or divestitures during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe and/or certain of our subsidiaries are involved from time to time in various lawsuits and claims relating to product liability, labeling, marketing, advertising, pricing, intellectual property, commercial contracts, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, labor and employment, indemnification, data privacy and cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety, and tax matters, governmental investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information regarding our current legal proceedings.\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against J&J and certain of its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily Johnson’s\n®\n Baby Powder. These personal injury suits were filed primarily in state and federal courts in the United States and in Canada.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement, J&J has retained the Talc-Related Liabilities and, as a result, has agreed to indemnify us for the Talc-Related Liabilities in the United States and Canada and any costs associated with resolving such claims. We will, however, remain responsible for all liabilities on account of or relating to harm arising out of, based upon or resulting from, directly or indirectly, the presence of or exposure to talc or talc-containing products sold outside the United States or Canada.\nExcept for the Talc-Related Liabilities and certain other liabilities for which the Company was indemnified by J&J, the Company generally remains responsible for liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from the past or current operation or conduct of the Company’s business.\nResults of Operations\nA detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in the results for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is presented below. A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in the results for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 can be found under the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II., Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 1, 2024 with the SEC (the “2023 Annual Report”).\n56\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended December 29, 2024 Compared with Fiscal Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOur results for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended\nChange In Fiscal Year\nDecember 29, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange 2023 to 2024\n(Dollars in Millions)\nAmount\nPercent\nNet sales\n$\n15,455 \n$\n15,444 \n$\n11 \n0.1 \n%\nCost of sales\n6,496 \n6,801 \n(305)\n(4.5)\nGross profit\n8,959\n \n8,643\n \n316\n \n3.7\n \nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n6,329 \n6,141 \n188 \n3.1 \nRestructuring expenses\n185 \n— \n185 \n*\nImpairment charges\n578 \n— \n578 \n*\nOther operating expense (income), net\n26 \n(10)\n36 \n*\nOperating income\n1,841\n \n2,512\n \n(671)\n(26.7)\nOther expense, net\n48 \n72 \n(24)\n(33.3)\nInterest expense, net\n378 \n250 \n128 \n51.2 \nIncome before taxes\n1,415\n \n2,190\n \n(775)\n(35.4)\nProvision for taxes\n385 \n526 \n(141)\n(26.8)\nNet income \n$\n1,030\n \n$\n1,664\n \n$\n(634)\n(38.1)\n%\n* Calculation not meaningful.    \nNet Sales\nNet sales were $15.5 billion and $15.4 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of $11 million, or 0.1%. Excluding the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $219 million, or 1.4%, Organic sales (a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in “Segment Results—Organic Sales Change” below) growth was $230 million, or 1.5%. Organic sales growth was driven by favorable value realization (defined as price, including mix) of 2.7%, partially offset by volume-related decreases of 1.2%. The increase in year-over-year value realization was primarily due to carryover price increases from the prior fiscal year as well as new pricing actions, while the volume-related decrease was primarily driven by Skin Health and Beauty and Self Care. Organic sales growth was primarily driven by growth in Essential Health across all product categories, led by Oral Care, as well as growth in Self Care, partially offset by declines in Skin Health and Beauty due to volume-related decreases in the United States attributable to the carryover effects from prior fiscal year execution challenges and current fiscal year competitive pressures. For additional information about the Net sales of our three reportable business segments, see “—Segment Results” below.\n57\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the change in U.S. GAAP Net sales to the change in Organic sales for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023:\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended December 29, 2024 vs December 31, 2023\n(1)\nReported Net sales change \nImpact of foreign currency\nOrganic sales change\n(Dollars in Millions)\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nAmount\nPercent\nTotal\n$\n11 \n0.1 \n%\n$\n(219)\n$\n230 \n1.5 \n%\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended December 29, 2024 vs December 31, 2023\n(1)\nReported Net sales change\nImpact of foreign currency\nOrganic sales change\nPrice/Mix\n(2)\nVolume\nTotal\n0.1 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n2.7 \n%\n(1.2)\n%\n(1)\n Acquisitions and divestitures did not materially impact Net sales for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n(2)\n Also referred to as value realization.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales were $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $305 million, or 4.5%. Gross profit margin expanded 200 basis points to 58.0%\n \nfor the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 as compared to 56.0% for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Changes in both Cost of sales and gross profit margin were primarily due to gains attributable to the realization of benefits associated with our supply chain optimization initiatives. Gross profit margin also increased due to value realization.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses were $6.3 billion and $6.1 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of $188 million, or 3.1%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased 120 basis points to 41.0% for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, as compared to 39.8% for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to higher expenses related to brand support, including advertising and healthcare professional engagement, as we increased our investment to further support sales across segments and geographies, and an additional quarter of incremental ongoing public company costs not incurred last year. These cost increases were partially offset by savings from Our Vue Forward and a $217 million decrease in Separation-related costs.\nRestructuring Expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $185 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, driven by costs incurred under Our Vue Forward related to global workforce reductions, changes in management structure, and the transition to centralized shared-service functions in lower-cost locations, as we began strategic initiatives intended to enhance organizational efficiencies and better position Kenvue for future growth. This includes employee-related costs, information technology and project-related costs, and other implementation costs. See Note 19, “Restructuring Expenses and Operating Model Optimization Initiatives,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nImpairment Charges\nImpairment charges were $578 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, which primarily included a non-cash charge of $488 million ($337 million after-tax) to adjust the carrying value of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment related to the Dr.Ci:Labo\n®\n skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to revisions to internal forecasts for the business as a result of updates in our strategy to reach more consumers and appropriately address evolving market dynamics, including shifts in consumer sentiment in China as well as changing shopping patterns in the region. The increase also included the impact of a $68 million non-cash impairment charge related to our interim corporate headquarters in Skillman, New Jersey, which was classified as held for sale on February 21, 2024. Additionally, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $22 million related to certain software development assets. See Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary \n58\nof Significant Accounting Policies—Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information. \nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net was $26 million and $(10) million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a change of $36 million. Expense for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 was driven by the $59 million accounting impact of net economic benefit arrangements with J&J in connection with the Deferred Local Businesses (see Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information), partially offset by $34 million of royalty income. Income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was driven by the prior period reversal of a $45 million contingent liability that was no longer considered to be probable, $35 million of royalty income, and a $9 million gain recognized on the sale of a manufacturing facility in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, partially offset by the $28 million accounting impact of net economic benefit arrangements with J&J in connection with the Deferred Local Businesses, and $26 million of litigation expense. See Note 13, “Other Operating Expense (Income), Net and Other Expense, Net,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net was $48 million and $72 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $24 million. Expense for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 was driven by $72 million in losses on investments, partially offset by a $21 million\n \ngain recognized on the release of tax indemnification reserves that were no longer considered to be probable. Expense for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was driven by $58 million in currency losses on transactions and $7 million in losses on investments. See Note 13, “Other Operating Expense (Income), Net and Other Expense, Net,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $378 million and $250 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of $128 million. The increase in expense was driven by an additional quarter of interest expense recognized on the Senior Notes and notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program not incurred last fiscal year, along with $33 million of interest income recognized in the fiscal three months ended July 2, 2023 in relation to the Facility Agreement (as defined in Note 5, “Borrowings—Facility Agreement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein) as well as interest income earned in the fiscal six months ended July 2, 2023 on debt proceeds in escrow. See Note 5, “Borrowings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nProvision For Taxes\nProvision for taxes was $385 million and $526 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $141 million. The decrease in Provision for taxes was primarily due to lower year-to-date income in comparison to the prior fiscal period as a result of the Dr.Ci:Labo\n® \nskin health business impairment for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and the recording of a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax benefits in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease is offset by fewer releases of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and reduced tax benefits derived from the Separation as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as well as unfavorable return-to-provision adjustments and shortfall on stock-based compensation recorded during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024. In addition, the worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 27.2% and 24.0%, respectively. See Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nSegment Results\nSegment profit is based on Operating income, excluding depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, Separation-related costs, restructuring and operating model optimization initiatives, impairment charges, the impact of the conversion of stock-based awards, issuance of Founder Shares (as defined below), Other operating expense (income), net, and unallocated general corporate administrative expenses (referred to herein as “Segment adjusted operating income”), as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM) excludes these items in assessing segment financial performance. General corporate/unallocated expenses, which include expenses related to treasury, legal operations, and certain other expenses, along with gains and losses related to \nthe overall management of our Company, are not allocated to the segments. In assessing segment performance and managing operations, the CODM does not review segment assets.\nSee Note 18, “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nA detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is presented below. A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 can be found under the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II., Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report. \nFiscal Twelve Months Ended December 29, 2024 Compared with Fiscal Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nThe following tables presents Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income and the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

On October 2, 2023, the Founder Shares were granted to all Kenvue employees in the form of stock options and PSUs to executive officers and either stock options and PSUs or RSUs to non-executive individuals (see Note 11, “Stock-Based Compensation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information).\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended\nChange in Fiscal Year\nDecember 29, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange 2023 to 2024\n(Dollars in Millions)\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\nSegment Net Sales\nSelf Care\n$\n6,527 \n42.3 \n%\n$\n6,451 \n41.8 \n%\n$\n76 \n1.2 \n%\nSkin Health and Beauty\n4,240 \n27.4 \n4,378 \n28.3 \n(138)\n(3.2)\nEssential Health\n4,688 \n30.3 \n4,615 \n29.9 \n73 \n1.6 \nSegment net sales\n$\n15,455\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n15,444\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n11\n \n0.1\n \n%\nSelf Care\n$\n2,173 \n$\n2,299 \n$\n(126)\n(5.5)\n%\nSkin Health and Beauty\n607 \n679 \n(72)\n(10.6)\nEssential Health\n1,162 \n1,011 \n151 \n14.9 \nSegment adjusted operating income\n(1)\n$\n3,942\n \n$\n3,989\n \n$\n(47)\n(1.2)\n%\n(1)\n Refer to the table above for the reconciliation of Segment adjusted operating income to Operating income and Income before taxes on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOrganic Sales Change\nWe define Organic sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, as Net sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We assess our Net sales performance by measuring the period-over-period change in Organic sales (previously referred to as “Organic growth”). Management believes reporting period-over-period changes in Organic sales provides investors with additional, supplemental information that is useful in assessing our results of operations by excluding the impact of certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our underlying operations.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the change in U.S. GAAP Net sales to the change in Organic sales for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023:\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended December 29, 2024 vs December 31, 2023\n(1)\nReported Net sales change \nImpact of foreign currency\nOrganic sales change\n(Dollars in Millions)\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nAmount\nPercent\nSelf Care\n$\n76 \n1.2 \n%\n$\n(44)\n$\n120 \n1.9 \n%\nSkin Health and Beauty\n(138)\n(3.2)\n(57)\n(81)\n(1.9)\nEssential Health\n73 \n1.6 \n(118)\n191 \n4.1 \nTotal\n$\n11\n \n0.1\n \n%\n$\n(219)\n$\n230\n \n1.5\n \n%\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended December 29, 2024 vs December 31, 2023\n(1)\nReported Net sales change\nImpact of foreign currency\nOrganic sales change\nPrice/Mix\n(2)\nVolume\nSelf Care\n1.2 \n%\n(0.7)\n%\n2.5 \n%\n(0.6)\n%\nSkin Health and Beauty\n(3.2)\n(1.3)\n1.6 \n(3.5)\nEssential Health\n1.6 \n(2.5)\n3.9 \n0.2 \nTotal\n0.1\n \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n2.7\n \n%\n(1.2)\n%\n(1)\n Acquisitions and divestitures did not materially impact Net sales for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n(2)\n Also referred to as value realization.\nSelf Care Segment\nSelf Care Segment Net Sales \nThe Self Care Segment Net sales were $6.5 billion for both the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, Net sales increased $76 million, or 1.2%, as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Excluding the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $44 million, or 0.7%, Organic sales growth was $120 million, or 1.9%. Organic sales growth was primarily driven by favorable value realization of 2.5% due to the performance in Smoking Cessation as a result of effective promotional strategies and product innovation, as well as Digestive Health and Allergy Care. Partially offsetting the favorable value realization, volume-related decreases reduced Organic sales by 0.6% driven by declines in Pain Care resulting from trade inventory fluctuations primarily in the United States as well as declines in pediatric products attributable to lower incidences of illnesses primarily in APAC and North America.\nSelf Care Segment Adjusted Operating Income\nThe Self Care Segment adjusted operating income decreased by $126 million, or 5.5%, to\n \n$2,173 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by increased investment in our brands and volume-related Net sales decreases, partially offset by favorable value realization and the realization of benefits associated with our supply chain optimization initiatives.\nSkin Health and Beauty Segment\nSkin Health and Beauty Segment Net Sales\nThe Skin Health and Beauty Segment Net sales were $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $138 million, or 3.2%. Excluding the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $57 million, or 1.3%, Organic sales decline was $81 million, or 1.9%. The Organic sales decline was primarily driven by volume-related decreases of 3.5%, primarily in the United States attributable to the carryover effects from prior fiscal year execution challenges, as well as current fiscal year competitive pressures, coupled \nwith market softness in China primarily impacting the first half of the fiscal year, partially offset by growth primarily in EMEA and LATAM. Partially offsetting the volume-related decrease, favorable value realization increased Organic sales by 1.6%.\nSkin Health and Beauty Segment Adjusted Operating Income\nThe Skin Health and Beauty Segment adjusted operating income decreased by $72 million, or 10.6%, to $607 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by increased investment in our brands and volume-related Net sales decreases, partially offset by the realization of benefits associated with our supply chain optimization initiatives and favorable value realization.\nEssential Health Segment\nEssential Health Segment Net Sales\nThe Essential Health Segment Net sales were $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of $73 million, or 1.6%. Excluding the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $118 million, or 2.5%, Organic sales growth was $191 million, or 4.1%. Organic sales growth, primarily driven by favorable value realization of 3.9%\n \nacross all product categories, was led by strong performance in Oral Care, attributable to product innovation and effective promotional strategies, and growth in Women’s Health.\nEssential Health Segment Adjusted Operating Income\nThe Essential Health Segment adjusted operating income increased by $151 million, or 14.9%, to $1,162 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by favorable value realization and the realization of benefits associated with our supply chain optimization initiatives, partially offset by increased investment in our brands.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrior to April 4, 2023, our working capital requirements and capital expenditures were satisfied as part of J&J’s corporate-wide cash management and centralized funding programs, and a substantial portion of our cash was transferred to J&J. Cash and cash equivalents held by J&J at the corporate level were not specifically identifiable to us.\nEffective April 4, 2023, upon completion of the Consumer Health Business Transfer (as defined in Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Description of the Company and Business Segments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein),\n \nwe no longer participate in J&J’s corporate-wide cash management and centralized funding programs.\nCash Flows\nSummarized cash flow information for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nChange In Fiscal Year\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended\nChange 2023 to 2024\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDecember 29, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmount\nPercent\nNet income\n$\n1,030 \n$\n1,664 \n$\n(634)\n(38.1)\n%\nNet changes in assets and liabilities\n$\n(571)\n$\n797 \n$\n(1,368)\n*\nNet cash flows from operating activities\n$\n1,769 \n$\n3,168 \n$\n(1,399)\n(44.2)\n%\nNet cash flows used in investing activities\n$\n(425)\n$\n(488)\n$\n63 \n(12.9)\n%\nNet cash flows used in financing activities\n$\n(1,565)\n$\n(2,527)\n$\n962 \n(38.1)\n%\n* Calculation not meaningful.\n59\nA detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in the results for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is presented below. A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in the results for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 can be found under the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II., Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities were $1.8 billion and $3.2 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $1,399 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in working capital balances driven by a net decrease in Accounts payable and Accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments and an increase in Trade receivables due to the timing of sales and collections.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $425 million and $488 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $63 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities were primarily driven by purchases of property, plant, and equipment in both the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $962 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 were primarily driven by $1,552 million of dividends paid and $235 million of payments made to purchase treasury stock, partially offset by $157 million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Program (as defined below). Net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 were primarily driven by $13.8 billion in distributions to J&J in connection with the Separation, $766 million of dividends paid, and Net transfers to J&J of $274 million, partially offset by approximately $7.7 billion of net proceeds from Senior Notes (as defined below), $4.2 billion of proceeds from the sale of common stock in connection with the Kenvue IPO, and $574 million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Program. Net transfers to J&J were driven by cash pooling and general financing activities, indirect corporate cost allocations from J&J, and taxes deemed to be settled with J&J. For further details regarding Net transfers to J&J, see Note 12, “Relationship with J&J—Net Transfers to J&J,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, which consisted of Cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion as of December 29, 2024, cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) of $4.0 billion, and authorized Commercial Paper Program issuance of $4.0 billion. As of December 29, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $797 million of outstanding balances under our Commercial Paper Program, net of a related discount of $3 million.\nOur ability to fund our operating needs will depend on our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations and on our ability to obtain debt financing on acceptable terms or to issue additional equity or equity-linked securities. Based upon our history of generating positive cash flows, we believe our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to service our current obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nManagement believes that our cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, along with borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide adequate liquidity to meet all of our current and long-term obligations when due, including third-party debt that we incurred in connection with the Separation, adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures, and flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms in the future.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $312 million during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 to $1,070 million as of December 29, 2024, as compared to $1,382 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was $1,044 million and $1,336 million as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n60\nRestructuring\nAs part of our continued transformation to a fit-for-purpose consumer company, during the fiscal year 2024, we began Our Vue Forward to enhance organizational efficiencies and better position Kenvue for future growth. To further Our Vue Forward, on May 6, 2024, our Board approved the 2024 Multi-Year Restructuring Initiative to build on our strengths, improve our underlying information technology infrastructure, and optimize our cost structure by rebalancing resources to better position us for future growth. The 2024 Multi-Year Restructuring Initiative is expected to result in pre-tax restructuring expenses and other charges totaling approximately $550 million. We planned to incur approximately $275 million in pre-tax restructuring expenses and other charges in each of fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025. We incurred lower than expected spend in fiscal year 2024 due to the shift in timing of certain information technology and project-related costs to fiscal year 2025 and lower than expected employee-related costs relating to severance spend due to employee redeployment and voluntary exits. Over the life of the initiative, a majority of the pre-tax expenses and other charges are expected to be paid in cash. These charges are expected to be funded primarily through cash flows generated from operations. We began to realize savings resulting from the 2024 Multi-Year Restructuring Initiative in fiscal year 2024, and we expect to realize the full extent of annualized pre-tax gross cost savings of approximately $350 million beginning in fiscal year 2026. We expect to reinvest all or a portion of the benefits associated with the 2024 Multi-Year Restructuring Initiative in future growth opportunities, including immediate reinvestment behind advertising, product promotion, and healthcare professional engagement. Our estimates of the costs of the initiative and the expected benefits are preliminary estimates and are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions. Actual charges may differ, possibly materially, from the estimates provided above. See Note 19, “Restructuring Expenses and Operating Model Optimization Initiatives,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.\nSupplier Finance Program\nAs a part of our ongoing efforts to maximize working capital and manage liquidity, we work with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable through a voluntary supplier finance program. The program provides some of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us (our accounts payables) to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. We are not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party financial institutions. Our obligations to the suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment dates (which have general payment terms between 30 and 120 days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to participate in the program. See Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Supplier Finance Program,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nSenior Notes\nOn March 22, 2023, we issued eight series of senior unsecured notes (the “Senior Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $7.75 billion. The net proceeds to us from the Senior Notes were approximately $7.7 billion after deductions of discounts and issuance costs of $77 million. The net proceeds were reflected as Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet prior to their release from escrow on April 5, 2023. Upon release from escrow, these funds were loaned to J&J through a facility agreement (the “Facility Agreement”) dated April 5, 2023. The interest payments on the Senior Notes are due on March 22 and September 22 of each year, and commenced on September 22, 2023. For further details on the Senior Notes, see Note 5, “Borrowings—Senior Notes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. \nOur Senior Notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indenture between us and a trustee (collectively, the “Indenture”). The Indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on us and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens or engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions. The Indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge, or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which the Senior Notes may be declared immediately due and payable.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOn March 3, 2023, we entered into a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”). Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $4.0 billion in an aggregate principal amount of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Program. Any such issuance will mature within 364 days from date of issue. The Commercial Paper Program contains representations and warranties, covenants, and defaults that are customary for this type of financing. The commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program are unsecured notes ranking at least \npari passu\n with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. For further details on the Commercial Paper Program, see Note 5, “Borrowings—Commercial Paper Program,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\n61\nPrior to the Kenvue IPO, we issued $1.25 billion under the Commercial Paper Program which, collectively with the Senior Notes as further described above, are referred to as the “Debt Financing Transactions.” \nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn March 6, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion to be made available in U.S. dollars and Euros. For further details on the Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 5, “Borrowings—Revolving Credit Facility,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nFacility Agreement\nOn April 5, 2023, we entered into the Facility Agreement, allowing us to lend the proceeds from the issuance of debt (including commercial paper) in an aggregate amount of $8.9 billion to J&J.\nUpon completion of the Kenvue IPO on May 8, 2023, the Facility Agreement was terminated and the balance of the loans, and all accrued interest, were repaid by J&J for a total cash inflow of $9.0 billion. We remitted this cash back to J&J as a distribution in connection with the Separation.\nDistribution to J&J\nOn May 8, 2023, in conjunction with the Consumer Health Business Transfer, we distributed $13.8 billion to J&J from 1) the net proceeds received from the sale of the common stock in the Kenvue IPO, 2) the net proceeds received from the Debt Financing Transactions, and 3) any cash and cash equivalents in excess of the $1.17 billion retained by us immediately following the Kenvue IPO.\nInterest Expense, Net\nWe recognized Interest expense, net of $378 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, which primarily includes interest expense, including amortization of discounts and debt issuance costs, recognized on the Senior Notes and interest expense recognized on notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program. \nCompliance with Covenants\nAs of December 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and no default or event of default has occurred.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nWe expect our future cash requirements will relate to working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring and integration, compensation and benefit-related obligations, interest expense and debt service obligations, litigation costs, the return of capital to shareholders, including through the payment of any dividends, and other contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business. We may also use cash to enter into business development transactions, such as licensing arrangements or strategic acquisitions.\nAs of December 29, 2024, we expect our primary cash requirements for fiscal year 2025 to include capital expenditures. We made payments of $434 million for property, plant, and equipment during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur Board has authorized a share repurchase program, under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 27,000,000 shares of our outstanding common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program has no expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The intent of this repurchase program is to offset dilution from the vesting or exercise of equity-based awards under the Kenvue 2023 Plan (as defined in Note 11, “Stock-Based Compensation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein). We repurchased 10,858,444 shares of our outstanding common stock for $235 million under the program during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024.\n62\nContractual Obligations\nWe are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, which impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our contractual cash obligations include required payments of short-term and long-term debt principal and interest, purchase obligations, expected obligations under our pension plans, operating and finance lease payments, and tax-related obligations. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\n•\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments\n—See Note 5, “Borrowings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments.\n•\nPurchase Obligations—\nAs of December 29, 2024, we had purchase obligations of approximately $0.5 billion in connection with suppliers for the purchases of raw materials, packaging, other materials, and finished goods in the normal course of business, which are payable within 12 months.\n•\nPensions\n—It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. See Note 7, “Pensions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our pension plans and the timing of expected future payments related to projected benefit plan contributions.\n•\nLeases\n—See Note 8, “Leases,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our operating and finance leases and the timing of expected future payments.\nSee Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our tax-related obligations.\nFuture Litigation\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in litigation, claims, government inquiries, investigations, charges, and proceedings. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further details regarding certain matters that are currently pending. Our ability to successfully resolve pending and future litigation may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined under the rules and regulations of the SEC) or any relationships with unconsolidated entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, Net sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements, or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that are most important and material to the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and which require management’s most subjective and complex judgments due to the need to select policies from various alternatives available and to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that these estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business and new information as it becomes available. If historical experience and other factors we use to make these estimates do not reasonably reflect future activity, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell our products to customers. Revenue from the sale of products to customers is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks, and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer depending on the terms of the contract. Net sales exclude taxes collected by us on behalf of governmental authorities and include the shipping and handling fees charged to customers.\nThe nature of our business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including trade promotions, comprised of coupons, product listing allowances, cooperative advertising arrangements, volume-based incentive programs, as well as \n63\ndiscounts to customers, rebates, sales incentives, and product returns, which are estimated at the time of the sale using the “expected value” method or the “most likely amount” method based on the form of variable consideration. Trade promotions, discounts to customers, rebates, and sales incentives are issued to customers at the point of sale and are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Revenue is recognized net of provisions for discounts and trade promotions. The potential of estimates to vary differs by product, customer type, and geographic location. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect updated expectations or actual results have not been material to our overall business.\nSee Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for disaggregation of Net sales and Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nIncome Taxes\nPrior to the Kenvue IPO, our operations were calculated on a carve-out basis and included certain hypothetical foreign tax credit benefits. Following the Kenvue IPO, these hypothetical foreign tax credit benefits are not available for future utilization by us and were removed from the tax provision. Furthermore, we operated as part of J&J until the completion of the Exchange Offer on August 23, 2023, and therefore the Company was included in J&J’s U.S. Federal consolidated income tax return until that date. We filed a standalone U.S. Federal consolidated income tax return and a standalone return in most other jurisdictions in which it operates for the remainder of fiscal year 2023 and will continue to file a standalone return for all fiscal years thereafter. Certain current income tax liabilities related to our activities included in J&J’s income tax returns were assumed to be immediately settled with J&J through the Net Investment from J&J or Additional Paid-In Capital accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023. Following the Exchange Offer, our operating footprint, as well as tax return elections and assertions, are different, and therefore, our income taxes, as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, may differ in future periods.\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current fiscal year and include the results of any differences between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nU.S. Federal, state, and foreign income tax payables and receivables are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for entities that file separate income tax returns and make direct payments to taxing authorities. Prior to the Kenvue IPO, U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax payables and receivables for entities that were included in the filing of a combined, consolidated, or group income tax return with J&J were deemed settled with J&J and were included in “Net Investment from J&J.”\nManagement establishes valuation allowances on deferred tax assets when it is determined to be “more likely than not” that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. Management considers positive and negative evidence in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including our historical results, forecasts of future ability to realize our deferred tax assets, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We follow U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The estimates for these positions are regularly assessed based upon all available information. These estimates may be revised in the future and such changes may result in a material additional expense or benefit to our financial results or our effective tax rate.\nIn the United States, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (“GILTI”). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that allowed companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or to provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist at the balance sheet date and are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). We previously followed J&J’s accounting policy to consider the deferred tax effects of GILTI. Effective in the fiscal three months \n64\nended October 1, 2023, the Company changed the accounting principle for GILTI from the deferred approach to the period cost approach. \nWe entered into a tax matters agreement with J&J in connection with the Separation. For more information on the Tax Matters Agreement, see Note 12, “Relationship with J&J—Transactions with J&J, Including the Separation Agreement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and our 2024 Proxy Statement.\nSee Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Income Taxes,” and Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information regarding income taxes.\nSee Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for the Company’s analysis on material changes in tax law.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\nA significant portion of our intangible assets relates to trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for our indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life.\nIntangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subjected to annual tests of impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that assets may be impaired. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the quantitative indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test is necessary. We may bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. \nAs part of our qualitative assessment, we consider several factors including macroeconomics conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), the recent and projected financial performance of our tested brands, significant changes in the specific market or regulatory environment in which we operate that would change the position of our products in the marketplace, pending litigation, and other factors, including the results of our last quantitative assessment.\nWhen performing the quantitative impairment assessment, we compare the estimated fair value of our trademarks and trade names to their carrying amounts as of the test date, which is on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate the fair value of trademarks and trade names based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This valuation requires significant judgments and estimates by management regarding several key inputs, including future cash flows consistent with management’s plans, sales growth rates, the selection of royalty rates, and a discount rate. As the fair value measurements required to estimate the fair value of the trademarks and trade names are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, they represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization\nOur definite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks, trade names, and customers lists) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for definite-lived intangible assets annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives. Our definite-lived intangible assets are subjected to a test of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When assessing for potential indicators of impairment, we consider several factors including any adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, any adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or is expected to be used, and current or forecasted reductions in net sales, operating income, or cash flows associated with the use of an asset.\nIf any indicators of impairment are present, the asset group is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If the net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset group, we then perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset group, and record an impairment, if any.\n65\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subjected to annual tests of impairment at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. We may bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment.\nWhen assessing for potential indicators of impairment, we consider several factors including macroeconomic industry and market conditions, significant adverse shifts in the operating environment or manner in which assets are used, and pending litigation.\nWhen performing the quantitative assessment, we compare the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying value as of the test date, which is on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model relies on assumptions regarding revenue and net income growth rates, projected working capital needs, capital expenditures, and discount rates. To estimate fair value, we discount the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit. The discount rate we use represents the estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in the reporting unit’s operations and the rate of return a market participant would expect to earn. The quantitative fair value test is performed utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the estimated cash flows in estimation of fair value.\nTo forecast a reporting unit’s cash flows, we take into consideration economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, management’s projections, a market participant’s view of growth rates and product lives, and anticipated future economic conditions. Revenue growth rates inherent in these forecasts are based on input from internal and external market research that compare factors such as growth in global economies, recent industry trends, and product lifecycles. Macroeconomic factors such as changes in global economies, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in government legislation, product lifecycles, industry consolidations, and other changes beyond our control could have a positive or negative impact on achieving its targets. Accordingly, if market conditions deteriorate, or if we are unable to execute our strategies, it may be necessary to record impairment charges in the future. As the fair value measurements required to estimate the fair value of our reporting units are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, they represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.\nSee Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 4, “Intangible Assets and Goodwill,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information regarding intangible assets and goodwill.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to equity-based awards granted ratably over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award, based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards.\nThe grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The inputs used in determining the grant date fair value are the expected volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free rate, and expected term.\nThe grant date fair value of each restricted stock unit (“RSU”) granted is equivalent to the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date. \nWe grant performance stock units (“PSUs”), including those with both performance vesting conditions and market-based vesting conditions (the “Performance PSUs”). The grant date fair value of each Performance PSU granted, inclusive of the fair value associated with the achievement of the specified performance metrics and the relative total shareholder return goal, is estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The inputs used in determining the grant fate fair value are the length of the performance period, the risk-free rate, and the stock prices, correlations, and expected volatility of the Company and the firms in the selected peer group. The payout of the Performance PSUs is assessed by determining the achievement of the specified performance metrics as well as by comparing the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) during a three-year period to the respective TSR of companies in a selected performance peer group. Given the requirement to meet certain defined performance and market criteria, the recipient of a Performance PSU may earn a total payout ranging from 0% to 200% of the target award.\n66\nDuring the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we granted PSUs that have a singular market condition (the “Market PSUs”). The grant date fair value of each Market PSU granted, inclusive of the fair value associated with the relative total shareholder return goal, was estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The inputs used in determining the grant date fair value were the length of the performance period, the risk-free rate, and the stock prices, correlations, and expected volatility of the Company and the firms in the selected peer group. The payout of the Market PSUs awards is assessed by comparing the Company’s TSR during a three-year period to the respective TSR of companies in a selected performance peer group. Given the requirement to meet certain defined market criteria, the recipient of a Market PSU may earn a total payout ranging from 0% to 200% of the target award. \nFor all equity-based awards, the original estimate of the grant date fair value is not subsequently revised unless the awards are modified. The Company accounts for forfeitures during the period in which they occur.\nSee Note 11, “Stock-Based Compensation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for more information on equity-based awards granted by Kenvue. \nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for a description of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted and their anticipated impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Information\nBaby Powder Transition\nOn August 11, 2022, we announced the commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio. As a result of this transition, talc-based Johnson’s\n®\n Baby Powder was discontinued globally in 2023. Talc-based Johnson’s\n®\n Baby Powder was previously discontinued during 2020 in certain markets, including the United States and Canada. The impact of this change did not have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nDeferred Markets\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement, in order to ensure compliance with applicable law, to obtain necessary governmental approvals and other consents, and for other business reasons, we and J&J deferred certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities of businesses in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, including China, Malaysia, and Russia, until after the completion of the Kenvue IPO. On September 11, 2023, J&J transferred the equity interests in the majority of the Deferred Legal Entities (as defined in Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein) to the Company that previously had been consolidated as Variable Interest Entities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein include businesses in all jurisdictions in which we operate following the completion of the Separation, including any Deferred Local Business (as defined in Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein). For more information regarding Deferred Local Businesses, see Part\n \nI, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Relationship with J&J—The transfer of certain assets and liabilities from J&J to us contemplated by the Separation has not been completed and may be significantly delayed or not occur at all,” and Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nProvision For Taxes\nOn December 15, 2022, the EU Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which g\nenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development (“OECD”) Pillar Two Inclusive Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. On July 17, 2023, the OECD published Administrative Guidance proposing certain safe harbors that effectively extend certain effective dates to January 1, 2027. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including guidance on safe harbors for which we may qualify, and many countries have already implemented legislation consistent with the OECD Pillar Two Framework. Due to these new rules, our provision for taxes could be unfavorably impacted as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we conduct business. However, based on our current analysis, currently enacted laws for Pillar Two do not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial \n67\nStatements\n. \nWe are continuing to evaluate the Model Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules for Pillar Two and related legislation, and their potential impact on future periods.",
