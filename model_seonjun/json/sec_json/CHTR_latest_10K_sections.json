Over an advanced communications network, we offer a full range of state-of-the-art residential and business services including Spectrum Internet\n®\n, TV, Mobile and Voice.  For small and medium-sized companies, Spectrum Business\n®\n delivers the same suite of broadband products and services coupled with special features and applications to enhance productivity, while for larger businesses and government entities, Spectrum Enterprise\n®\n provides highly customized, fiber-based solutions. Spectrum Reach\n®\n delivers tailored advertising and production for the modern media landscape. We also distribute award-winning news coverage and sports programming to our customers through Spectrum Networks.   \nOur strategy is focused on utilizing our high bandwidth connectivity network to deliver high-quality, competitively priced products, with outstanding service, allowing us to increase both the number of customers we serve over our network and the number of products we sell to each customer.  This combination also reduces the number of service transactions we perform per relationship, yielding higher customer satisfaction and lower customer churn, which results in lower costs to acquire and serve customers and greater profitability.  \nProducts\nWe continue to evolve our connectivity network to offer symmetrical and multi-gigabit Internet speeds across our entire footprint and have launched symmetrical Internet service in eight markets and 2x1 Gbps service in two markets.  Advanced WiFi, a managed WiFi service that provides customers an optimized home network while providing greater control of connected devices with enhanced security and privacy, is available to all Internet customers.  Spectrum Mobile\n®\n is available to all new and existing Internet customers and offers plans that include 5G access, do not require contracts and include taxes and fees in the price. We continue to innovate our video product and recently transformed all of our affiliation agreements with major programmers. These new agreements give us greater overall packaging flexibility and the ability to include the ad-supported versions of key programmer streaming applications within our video packages along with the ability to upgrade to ad-free versions and to sell those applications to customers a la carte for a seamless entertainment experience. Together with our Xumo Stream Boxes (“Xumo”), our goal is to deliver utility and value for our customers, irrespective of how they want to view content, and better and more stable economics for our programming partners and us.\nPricing & Packaging and Customer Commitments\nOur fully deployed high-bandwidth network offers ubiquitous and seamless connectivity products.  It removes barriers and creates opportunities for customers, in every aspect of their lives, which led us to our new brand platform, Life Unlimited\n™\n.  As part of the new brand platform, which we launched in the fall of 2024, we also launched a new, simplified pricing strategy that better utilizes our seamless connectivity and entertainment products to offer lower promotional and persistent bundled pricing to drive customer and financial growth. Additionally, we announced new customer commitments, focused on reliable connectivity, transparency, exceptional service and a focus on always improving.  Through reliable connectivity, we are committed to keeping our customers connected 100% of the time and promptly resolving issues. Transparency at every step means we are committed to clear and simple pricing and timely service updates, and we will take responsibility when things go wrong. Through exceptional service, we are committed to providing exceptional customer experiences.  And finally, always improving means we act on our customers' feedback to improve our products and customer service.\nNetwork Evolution \nOur network and product evolution plan continues to progress, with a clear path to delivering symmetrical and multi-gig speeds to our customers across our footprint, meeting the needs of today and anticipating the growing demand for faster speeds for years to come.  We continue to expand the capacity of our hybrid fiber coaxial network using a number of technologies, including spectrum expansion, initially to 1.2 GHz and then to 1.8 GHz, changing the bandwidth allocation to a \"high split\" to increase upstream speeds, Distributed Access Architecture (\"DAA\") and DOCSIS 4.0 technology.  Through this process, which we expect to complete in 2027, we will transform our network to enable multi-gigabit data speeds to customers. Those faster speeds will be offered in conjunction with our Spectrum Mobile product and Advanced WiFi, providing customers seamless and convenient, ultra-fast converged connectivity in attractively priced packages. \n1\nExpansion\nSince inception in the beginning of 2022, we have spent $5.5 billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative and activated approximately 813,000 passings.  Rural builds present strategic footprint expansion opportunities to unserved and underserved passings.  Our rural investments will allow us to offer a suite of broadband connectivity services, including fixed Internet, WiFi and mobile to unserved areas in states where we currently operate.  To accomplish all of this, we have invested in new teams, new training and new equipment. These investments will allow us to generate long-term infrastructure-style returns by taking further advantage of our scale efficiencies, network quality and construction capabilities, while offering our high-quality products and services to more homes and businesses.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 400 Washington Blvd., Stamford, Connecticut 06902.  Our telephone number is (203) 905-7801, and we have a website accessible at ir.charter.com.  Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments thereto, are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed.  The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this annual report. \n2\nCorporate Entity Structure \nThe chart below sets forth our entity structure and that of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.  The chart does not include all of our affiliates and subsidiaries and, in some cases, we have combined separate entities for presentation purposes.  The equity ownership percentages shown below for Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”) are approximations.  Indebtedness amounts shown below are principal amounts as of December 31, 2024.  See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” which also includes the accreted values of the indebtedness described below.  \n3\nFootprint\nWe operate in geographically diverse areas which are managed centrally on a consolidated level.  The map below highlights our footprint along with our planned rural expansion over the span of the initiative based on grants awarded as of December 31, 2024.  \nProducts and Services\n \nWe offer our customers subscription-based Internet, video, mobile and voice services, with prices and related charges based on the types of service selected, whether the services are sold as a “bundle” or on an individual basis, and based on the equipment necessary to receive our services.  Bundled services, including some combination of our Internet, video, mobile and/or voice products are available to substantially all of our passings. \n4\nThe following table summarizes our customer statistics for Internet, video, mobile and voice as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands except per customer data and footnotes). \nApproximate as of\nDecember 31,\n2024\n (a)\n2023\n (a)\nCustomer Relationships\n (b)\nResidential\n29,258 \n29,904 \nSmall and Medium Business (\"SMB\")\n2,215 \n2,222 \nTotal Customer Relationships \n31,473 \n32,126 \nMonthly Residential Revenue per Residential Customer\n (c)\n$\n121.04 \n$\n119.89 \nMonthly SMB Revenue per SMB Customer\n (d)\n$\n164.08 \n$\n163.64 \nInternet\nResidential\n28,034 \n28,544 \nSMB\n2,046 \n2,044 \nTotal Internet Customers\n30,080 \n30,588 \nVideo\nResidential\n12,327 \n13,503 \nSMB\n565 \n619 \nTotal Video Customers\n12,892 \n14,122 \nMobile Lines\n \n(e)\nResidential\n9,568 \n7,519 \nSMB\n315 \n247 \nTotal Mobile Lines\n9,883 \n7,766 \nVoice\nResidential\n5,636 \n6,712 \nSMB\n1,248 \n1,293 \nTotal Voice Customers\n6,884 \n8,005 \nEnterprise Primary Service Units (\"PSUs\") \n(f)\n319 \n303 \n(a)\nWe calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account in accordance with our collection policies.  On that basis, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, customers include approximately 102,500 and 135,800 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 12,100 and 54,700 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due, and approximately 13,600 and 286,000 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due.  The decrease in accounts past due is predominately due to revisions to customer account balances associated with the end of the Federal Communications Commission's (“FCC”) Affordable Connectivity Program (\"ACP\"), including balance write-offs and conversion to payment plans.     \n(b)\nCustomer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing Internet, video, mobile and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive.  Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”) and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU.  Total customer relationships exclude enterprise and mobile-only customer relationships.\n(c)\nMonthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential annual revenue divided by twelve divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective year and excludes mobile-only customers.\n(d)\nMonthly SMB revenue per SMB customer is calculated as total SMB annual revenue divided by twelve divided by average SMB customer relationships during the respective year and excludes mobile-only customers.\n(e)\nMobile lines include phones and tablets which require one of our standard rate plans (e.g., \"Unlimited\" or \"By the Gig\").  Mobile lines exclude wearables and other devices that do not require standard phone rate plans.\n5\n(f)\nEnterprise PSUs represent the aggregate number of fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering at each customer location as an individual PSU.\nResidential Services\nConnectivity Services\nWe provide our customers with a suite of broadband connectivity services, including fixed Internet, WiFi and mobile, which when bundled together provides our customers with a differentiated converged connectivity experience while saving consumers money.    \nWe offer Spectrum Internet products with speeds up to 1 Gbps across our entire footprint.  Spectrum Internet bundled with our in-home Advanced WiFi allows multiple people within a single household to stream high definition (“HD”) video content while simultaneously using our Internet service for other purposes including two-way video conferencing, gaming and virtual reality, among other things.    \nOur in-home WiFi product provides our Internet customers with high performance wireless routers and a managed WiFi service to maximize their wireless Internet experience.  We offer Advanced WiFi service across all of our footprint along with WiFi 6E routers capable of delivering speeds over 2 Gbps.  In 2024, we began offering WiFi 7 routers capable of delivering speeds over 10 Gbps.  With Advanced WiFi, customers enjoy a cloud-optimized WiFi connection and have the ability to view and control their WiFi network through our Spectrum app (“My Spectrum\n®\n App”).  The service enables parental control schedules and Spectrum Security Shield which is automatically enabled and protects all devices in the home using network-based security.  Customers also have the option to add Spectrum WiFi pods to Advanced WiFi.  WiFi pods are small, discreet access points that plug into electrical outlets in the home, providing broader and more consistent WiFi coverage.\nWe also offer the capabilities of the Advanced WiFi service to MDUs as Advanced Community WiFi (“ACW”).  With ACW, tenants receive the same visibility and control over their apartment’s WiFi networks through the My Spectrum App, while building managers are able to see and manage the entire building’s network through a purpose-built property service portal.  In 2024, we began offering to MDUs and bulk single-family communities Spectrum Ready, which allows customers to set up Spectrum Internet with Advanced WiFi and video services in their home without ordering equipment or scheduling installation through permanent WiFi routers already installed in the property.  New residents simply scan a QR code and confirm services through a new or existing Spectrum account.   \nOur Spectrum Mobile service is offered to customers subscribing to our Internet service and uses the customers’ private WiFi, our Spectrum Mobile network (comprised of out-of-home WiFi access points across our footprint combined with out-of-home WiFi access points from other networks with which we partner) as well as leveraging the cellular network of Verizon Communications Inc. (\"Verizon\").  We leverage the Verizon cellular network to provide nationwide coverage including unlimited calls, text and data using Verizon’s fourth generation and fifth generation (“5G”) service including their 5G ultra-wide band services.  Spectrum Mobile also uses Verizon’s international roaming partner network to ensure customers have coverage around the globe. Customers can use their Spectrum Mobile device to connect to their Spectrum WiFi, which increases speeds and provides a superior experience while in the home and on-the-go via the Spectrum Mobile network.  In addition, we continue to focus on improving the customer experience and integrating our mobile and fixed Internet products with enhancements such as Spectrum Mobile Speed Boost (“Speed Boost”).  Customers are eligible for Speed Boost if they have both Spectrum Mobile and Spectrum Internet, a DOCSIS 3.1 modem and an Advanced WiFi router.  When connected on their Spectrum Mobile device through Advanced WiFi service, customers are now experiencing the fastest overall speeds up to 1 Gbps.  \nWe provide wireline voice communications services using voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) technology to transmit digital voice signals over our network.  Our voice services include unlimited local and long distance calling to the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, voicemail, call waiting, caller ID, call forwarding and other features and offers international calling either by the minute, or through packages of minutes per month.  We also offer Call Guard, an advanced caller ID and robocall blocking solution, for our residential and SMB voice customers. Call Guard reduces customer frustration and improves security by blocking malicious calls while ensuring our customers continue to receive the legitimate automated calls they need from schools or healthcare providers.\n6\nVideo Services \nWe provide our customers with a choice of video programming services on a variety of platforms including through a digital Spectrum Receiver or an Internet Protocol (\"IP\") device. Video customers have access to a variety of programming packages with approximately 375 channels available in home and out of home allowing our customers to access the programming they want, when they want it, on any device. In 2024, we began offering certain seamless entertainment applications including, among others, Max, Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, ViX Premium and Tennis Channel Plus to customers in certain packages and reached agreements with several other programmers that will add Discovery+, Peacock, AMC+ and BET+ in certain packages in 2025.  We now have completed deals with every major programmer to deliver better flexibility and greater value to our customers by including seamless entertainment applications with our Spectrum TV\n®\n services at no additional cost.  \nOur video service also includes access to an interactive programming guide with parental controls, video on demand (“VOD”) and pay-per-view services.  VOD service allows customers to select from approximately 100,000 titles at any time.  VOD programming options may be accessed at no additional cost if the content is associated with a customer’s linear subscription, or for a fee on a transactional basis.  VOD services are also offered on a subscription basis, included in a digital tier premium channel subscription, or for a monthly fee.  Pay-per-view channels allow customers with a set-top box to pay on a per-event basis to view a single showing of a one-time special sporting event, music concert, or similar event on a commercial-free basis. We also offer digital video recorder (“DVR”) service that enables customers to digitally record programming and to pause and rewind live programming on set-top boxes.  Our cloud DVR service allows customers to schedule, record and watch their favorite programming anytime from the Spectrum TV app as well as SpectrumTV.com. \nWe continue to deploy our Xumo stream boxes to new video customers.  Xumo combines a live TV experience with access to hundreds of content applications and features unified search and discovery along with a curated content offering based on the customer's interests and subscriptions.  Combined with our Spectrum TV app, Xumo is now our preferred go-to-market platform for new video sales.  \nCustomers are increasingly accessing their subscription video content through our highly rated Spectrum TV app via mobile devices and connected IP devices, such as Xumo, Apple TV, Roku and Samsung TV.  Access to the Spectrum TV app is included in all Spectrum TV video plans.  The Spectrum TV app allows users to stream content across a growing number of platforms as well as access their full TV lineup and watch on demand content.  It also supports DVR functionality through our cloud DVR offering.    \nCommercial Services \nWe offer scalable broadband communications solutions for businesses and carrier organizations of all sizes, selling Internet access, data networking, fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video entertainment services and business telephone services.  \n \nSmall and Medium Business\nSpectrum Business offers Internet, video, mobile and voice services to SMBs over our hybrid fiber coaxial network.  We also offer Advanced WiFi service to SMBs, which leverages the residential platform features, including Security Shield, with features specific to small and medium-size business such as a guest service set identifier (“SSID”).  Spectrum Business includes a full range of video programming and offers Internet speeds up to 1 Gbps across our entire footprint.  Spectrum Business also includes a set of business services including static IP and business WiFi, e-mail and security, and voice services through either a traditional voice offering or hosted voice solution.  Spectrum Business Connect is an SMB communications solution that includes Spectrum Internet, voice and complementary mobility features allowing our customers’ remote and office employees to stay more easily connected regardless of their location.  We also offer Wireless Internet Backup to our SMB customers which is designed to enhance and protect Internet service for SMBs in the event of a network disruption.  \n \nEnterprise \nSpectrum Enterprise offers tailored connectivity, communications and managed service solutions over a high-capacity last-mile network with speeds up to 100 Gbps to larger businesses and government entities (local, state and federal), in addition to wholesale services to mobile and wireline carriers.  The Spectrum Enterprise product portfolio includes connectivity services such as Internet Access (fiber, coax and wireless delivered); Wide Area Network (“WAN”) services (Ethernet, Software Defined (“SD”)-WAN and cloud connectivity) that privately and securely connect geographically dispersed customer locations and cloud service providers; and Managed Service solutions which address a wide range of enterprise networking (e.g. routing, \n7\nLocal Area Network (“LAN”), WiFi) and security (e.g. firewall, Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) protection) challenges. To meet the communications needs of these more sophisticated customers, Spectrum Enterprise also offers an array of voice trunking services and unified messaging, communications and collaboration products. We offer Unified Communications services integrated with our connectivity and managed services to give customers more choices for enhancing their digital experience across locations and devices.  In addition, Spectrum Enterprise offers a wide range of video solutions targeting unique needs of customers across multiple industries with a specific focus on hospitality, healthcare, government and education. Spectrum Enterprise serves businesses nationally by combining its large serviceable footprint with a robust portfolio of fiber lit buildings and a significant wholesale partner network. As a result, these customers benefit by obtaining advanced solutions from a single provider who is committed to an exceptional customer experience and who delivers compelling value by simplifying procurement and offering competitive pricing potentially reducing our customers' costs.\nAdvertising Services\nOur advertising sales division, Spectrum Reach, offers local, regional and national businesses the opportunity to advertise in individual and multiple service areas on cable television networks, various streaming services and numerous advanced advertising platforms.  We receive revenues from the sale of local advertising across various platforms for networks such as TBS, CNN and ESPN.  We insert local advertising on up to 100 channels in over 90 markets and on multiple streaming services/free advertising-supported streaming television (“FAST”) channels including Amazon, Xumo and others.  Our large footprint provides opportunities for advertising customers to address broader regional audiences from a single provider and thus reach more customers with a single transaction.  Our size also provides scale to invest in new technology to create more targeted and addressable advertising capabilities. \nAvailable advertising time is generally sold by our advertising sales force.  In some service areas, we have formed advertising interconnects or entered into representation agreements with other video distributors, including, among others, Verizon, DirecTV and Comcast, under which we sell advertising on behalf of those operators.  In other service areas, we enter into representation agreements under which another operator in the area will sell advertising on our behalf.  These arrangements enable us and our partners to represent and deliver commercials on their inventory across wider geographic areas, replicating the reach of local broadcast television stations to the extent possible.  In addition, we enter into interconnect agreements from time to time with other cable operators, which, on behalf of a number of video operators, sell advertising time to national and regional advertisers in individual or multiple service areas.\nAdditionally, we sell the advertising inventory of our owned and operated local sports and news channels, of our regional sports networks that carry Los Angeles Lakers’ basketball games and other sports programming and of SportsNet LA, a regional sports network that carries Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming.\nIn conjunction with other multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), Spectrum Reach enables multi-channel cable networks (e.g. AMC, Univision) to deploy household addressability on their own inventory in our footprint, charging them an enablement fee.  Our fully deployed Audience App, which uses our proprietary set-top box viewership data (all anonymized and aggregated), allows us to create data-driven linear TV campaigns for local advertisers.  Spectrum Reach also offers a programmatic sales platform allowing advertising agencies and advertisers to buy inventory in a fully automated way.  Streaming TV, which is largely comprised of Spectrum TV app impressions, as well as those from numerous over-the-top streaming content providers, is part of our suite of advanced advertising products available to the marketplace.  Additionally, Spectrum Reach purchases third-party inventory in our markets when needed.  Spectrum Reach is also now employing multi-screen deterministic attribution services for television and streaming services that lets advertisers know the effectiveness of their advertising on Spectrum Reach’s platform.\nOther Services\nRegional Sports Networks \nWe have an agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers for rights to distribute all locally available Los Angeles Lakers’ games through 2033. We broadcast those games on our regional sports network, Spectrum SportsNet.  American Media Productions, LLC (\"American Media Productions\"), an unaffiliated third party, owns SportsNet LA, a regional sports network carrying the Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming.  In accordance with agreements with American Media Productions, we act as the network’s exclusive affiliate and advertising sales representative and have certain branding and programming rights with respect to the network.  In addition, we provide certain production and technical services to American Media Productions. The affiliate, advertising, production and programming agreements continue through 2038.  We also own \n8\n26.8% of Sterling Entertainment Enterprises, LLC (doing business as SportsNet New York), a New York City-based regional sports network that carries New York Mets’ baseball games as well as other regional sports programming.\nNews Channels\nWe own and manage over 30 local news channels, including Spectrum News NY1\n®\n and Spectrum News SoCal, 24-hour news channels focused on New York City and Los Angeles, respectively. Our local news channels connect the diverse communities and neighborhoods we serve providing 24/7 news, weather and community content focused on hyperlocal stories that address the deeper needs and interests of our customers.  Customers can also read, watch and listen to news stories by our Spectrum News journalists and local partner publications on their mobile device on our Spectrum News application and certain smart TVs and streaming devices.\nCommunity Solutions\nSpectrum Community Solutions\n®\n (“SCS”) delivers broadband connectivity solutions to apartments, single-family gated communities, off-campus student housing, senior residences and RV parks and marinas. Services offered by SCS include Internet speeds up to 2 Gbps, property-wide managed WiFi coverage, Spectrum Ready service and traditional and streaming video packages, as well as customized fiber and coaxial solutions for new construction and established communities.  SCS also manages our relationships with third-party resellers of Spectrum services to MDUs.  In addition, SCS is responsible for our non-bulk MDU salesforce covering sales within existing, serviceable MDU properties.  Our SCS bulk customers are serviced by dedicated call centers.\nPricing of Our Products and Services\n \nOur revenues are principally derived from the monthly fees customers pay for the services we provide.  We typically charge a one-time installation fee which is sometimes waived or discounted in certain sales channels during certain promotional periods. \nOur Spectrum pricing and packaging generally offers a standardized price across our services with bundle options designed to drive more value into a package to fit the customer need.  We believe Spectrum pricing and packaging:\n•\noffers a higher quality and more value-based set of services relative to our competitors, including fast Internet speeds, with integrated mobile and video options and a transparent pricing structure;\n•\noffers simplicity for customers to understand our offers, and for our employees in service delivery;\n•\ndrives our ability to package more services at the time of sale, thus increasing revenue per customer;\n•\ndrives higher customer satisfaction, lower service calls and churn; and\n•\nallows for gradual price increases at the end of promotional periods.\nWe also have specialized offerings to enhance affordability of our Internet product for qualified low-income households, including Spectrum Internet Assist, a 50 megabits per second (\"Mbps\") service, and Internet Advantage, a 100 Mbps service.  Both are low cost and include a modem for no additional charge.  \nIn 2024, we introduced new bundles that better utilize our unique product assets with guaranteed pricing for up to three years and speed options that will benefit new customers, create more choices and provide faster speeds for existing customers.  For customers who don’t take advantage of these new bundled rates, our Spectrum One\n™\n offering provides a differentiated connectivity experience by bringing together Spectrum Internet, Advanced WiFi and Unlimited Spectrum Mobile to offer consumers fast, reliable and secure online connections on their favorite devices at home and on-the-go in a high-value package.  Alternatively, our mobile customers can choose from unlimited or by-the-gig data usage plans and can easily switch between mobile data plans during the month. All plans include 5G service, free nationwide talk and text, and simple pricing that includes all taxes and fees.  Our Unlimited Plus plan also includes an additional 20 gigabytes of data, free roaming in Canada and Mexico and our Anytime Upgrade program that allows customers to upgrade their devices whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees and condition requirements.  Customers can also purchase mobile devices and accessory products and have the option to pay for devices under interest-free monthly installment plans.  Our device portfolio includes 5G models from Apple, Google and Samsung and we offer trade-in options along with our Phone Balance Buyout program which makes switching mobile providers easier by helping customers pay off balances on ported lines.  \n9\nOur Network Technology\n \nOur network includes three key components: a national backbone, regional/metro networks and a “last-mile” network.  Both our national backbone and regional/metro network components utilize a redundant IP ring/mesh fiber architecture.  The national backbone component provides connectivity from regional demarcation points to nationally centralized content, connectivity and services.  The regional/metro network components provide connectivity between the regional demarcation points and headends within a specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and services between these network components.\nOur last-mile network utilizes a hybrid fiber coaxial cable (“HFC”) architecture, which combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable.  In most systems, we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes, and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes served by that node.  Our design standard allows spare fiber strands to each node to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity, and enterprise customer needs as they arise.  For our Spectrum Enterprise customers, fiber optic cable is extended to the customer’s site.  For most new buildouts, including for our rural construction initiative, and MDU sites, we utilize a fiber deployment. We believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality with a cost-efficient path to increased speeds.  \nHFC architecture benefits include: \n•\nbandwidth capacity to enable video and broadband services;\n•\ndedicated bandwidth for delivering higher signal quality and service reliability, which provides an advantage over cell phone home Internet offerings; \n•\nthe ability to upgrade capacity at a lower incremental capital cost relative to our competitors; \n•\na powered network enabling out-of-home Advanced WiFi and 5G small cell access points; and\n•\nexisting infrastructure with connections capable of self installation by the customer in most of our passings. \nOur systems currently provide a two-way all-digital platform, leveraging DOCSIS 3.1 technology and bandwidth of 750 megahertz or greater, to virtually all of our passings.  This bandwidth-rich network enables us to offer a large selection of HD channels and Spectrum Internet Gig across all of our footprint which enables us to provide fast, reliable and secure online connections, meeting current customer demands.  \nThrough our network evolution initiative, we are currently expanding our spectrum to 1.2 Ghz through a module upgrade in the hub, node and amplifier and using high splits and DAA to deliver multi-gig speed capabilities while using the current DOCSIS 3.1 customer premise equipment. When paired with the next generation of DOCSIS modem, DOCSIS 4.0, we will be able to deliver even faster speeds.  Next, we will begin to deploy DOCSIS 4.0 technology in the network, and further increase our spectrum to 1.8 Ghz enabling even higher speed capabilities.  This network evolution will also allow us to extend fiber services to the home in a success based “Fiber on Demand” manner.  \nWe plan to complement our wireline investments with planned WiFi upgrades for in-home routers. With nearly 500 million devices connected wirelessly to our network in our customers' homes and businesses, we are unlocking our network investments for multi-gigabit speeds through the deployment of WiFi 7 routers that we launched in late 2024. \nWe own 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) Priority Access Licenses (“PALs”).  We intend to use these licenses along with unlicensed CBRS spectrum to build our own 5G data-only mobile network on targeted 5G small cell sites leveraging our HFC network to provide power and data connectivity to the majority of the sites.  These 5G small cells, combined with growing WiFi capabilities, increase speed and reliability along with improving our cost structure through offload of wireless data onto our owned networks.  We continue to deploy 5G small cell sites in targeted areas of our footprint, as part of our broader multi-year 5G mobile network buildout, based on disciplined cost reduction targets.\nSubsidized Rural Construction Initiative\nIn 2024, we continued our subsidized rural construction initiative in which we intend to expand our network to offer a suite of broadband connectivity services, including fixed Internet, WiFi and mobile to over 1.7 million passings in unserved areas in states where we currently operate.  Since inception in the beginning of 2022, we have spent $5.5 billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative and activated approximately 813,000 passings.  Including amounts spent to date, we expect to invest over $8 billion in total over the span of the initiative, a portion of which we expect to offset with government funding, including over $2 billion of support awarded through December 31, 2024 in the Rural Development Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”) auction and other federal, state and municipal grants.  We also expect to participate in additional federal, state and municipal grant programs \n10\nover the coming years, including the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (“BEAD”) program, if regulatory conditions are conducive to private investment.  In addition to construction in areas subsidized by various government grants, we expect to continue rural construction in areas near our current plant and in areas surrounding subsidized construction where synergies can be achieved.  These investments will allow us to generate long-term infrastructure-style returns by further taking advantage of our scale efficiencies, network quality and construction capabilities, while offering our high-quality products and services to more homes and businesses. We expect these newly served homes will be enabled to engage in remote work, virtual learning, telemedicine and other bandwidth-heavy applications that require high speed broadband connectivity. Newly served rural areas will also benefit from our high-value Spectrum pricing and packaging structure including our mobile and voice offerings, as well as our comprehensive selection of video products.  The successful and timely execution of such fiber-based construction is dependent on a variety of external factors, including the make-ready and utility pole permitting processes.  With fewer homes and businesses in these areas, broadband providers need to access multiple poles per home, as opposed to multiple homes per pole in higher-density settings.  As a result, pole applications, pole replacement rules and their affiliated issue resolution processes are all factors that can have a significant impact on construction timing and speed to completion.  The RDOF auction rules and other subsidy grants establish construction milestones for the build-out utilizing subsidized funding.  Failure to meet those milestones could subject us to financial penalties.   \nManagement, Customer Operations and Marketing \nOur operations are centralized, with senior executives responsible for coordinating and overseeing operations, including establishing company-wide strategies, policies and procedures.  Sales and marketing, field operations, customer operations, network operations, engineering, advertising sales, human resources, legal, government relations, information technology and finance are all directed at the corporate level.  Regional and local field operations are responsible for customer premise service transactions and maintaining and constructing that portion of our network which is located outdoors.  Our field operations strategy includes completing a significant portion of our activity with our own employees which we find drives consistent and higher quality services.  In 2024, our in-house field operations workforce handled approximately 85% of our customer premise service transactions.  In addition, we have been growing our in-house construction teams to perform a portion of our network expansion initiatives.    \nWe continue to focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced product offerings, reliability of services, and delivery of quality customer service.  As part of our operating strategy, we insource most of our customer operations workload.  Our in-house call centers handle all of our customer service calls.  We manage our customer service call centers centrally to ensure a consistent, high-quality customer experience.  In addition, we route calls by call type to specific agents that only handle such call types, enabling agents to become experts in addressing specific customer needs, creating a better customer experience.  Service from our call centers continues to become more efficient as a result of new tool enhancements that give our front-line customer service agents more context and real-time information about the customer and their services which allows them to more effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues.  Our call center agent desktop interface tool enables virtualization of all call centers thereby better serving our customers.  Virtualization allows calls to be routed across our call centers regardless of the location origin of the call, reducing call wait times, and saving costs.       \nWe also provide customers with the opportunity to interact with us in the manner they choose through self-service options on our customer website and mobile device application, or via telephonic communication, online chat and social media. Our customer websites and mobile applications enable customers to pay their bills, manage their accounts, order and activate new services and utilize self-service help and support.  In addition, our self-install program has been beneficial for customers who need flexibility in the timing of their installation.\nWe sell our residential and commercial services using national brand platforms known as Spectrum, Spectrum Business, Spectrum Enterprise, Spectrum Reach and Spectrum Community Solutions.  These brands reflect our comprehensive approach to industry-leading products, driven by speed, performance and innovation.  Our marketing strategy emphasizes the sale of our bundled services through targeted direct response marketing programs to existing and potential customers, and increases awareness and the value of the Spectrum brand.  Our marketing organization creates and executes marketing programs intended to grow customer relationships, increase the number of services we sell per relationship, retain existing customers and cross-sell additional products to current customers.  We monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, customer perception, competition, pricing, and service preferences, among other factors, in order to increase our responsiveness to our customers and to improve our sales and customer retention.  In September 2024, we launched our Life Unlimited brand platform which includes a new customer commitment that provides performance and service benchmarks and a new and simplified pricing structure designed to drive more value into our relationships.  The marketing organization manages all residential, SMB and enterprise sales channels including inbound, direct sales, online, outbound telemarketing and stores.\n11\nProgramming\n \nWe believe that offering a wide variety of video programming choices influences a customer’s decision to subscribe to and retain our video and Internet services.  We obtain basic and premium programming, usually pursuant to written contracts from a number of suppliers.  We have also been successful in obtaining access to the related programmer streaming applications pursuant to those contracts.  Media corporation and broadcast station group consolidation has, however, resulted in fewer suppliers and additional selling power on the part of programming suppliers.  \nProgramming is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom we make that programming available.  Programming license fees may include various discounts such as “volume” discounts and other financial incentives and/or ongoing marketing support, as well as discounts for service penetration.  We receive revenue to carry home shopping channels.  We also offer VOD and pay-per-view channels of movies and events that are subject to a revenue split with the content provider.  \nCompetition\nResidential Services\nWe face intense competition for residential customers, both from existing competitors and, as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products, from new entrants. \nInternet Competition\nOur residential Internet service faces competition across our footprint from fiber-to-the-home (\"FTTH\"), fixed wireless broadband, Internet delivered via satellite and DSL services.  AT&T Inc. (\"AT&T\"), Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier”) and Verizon are our primary FTTH competitors and several of these FTTH competitors deliver 1 Gbps broadband speed (and some deliver multi Gbps) in at least a portion of their footprints which overlap our footprint.  Additionally, several national mobile network operators offer long-term evolution (“LTE”) or 5G delivered cell phone home Internet service (fixed wireless access from cell phone towers) in our markets.  In several markets, we also face competition from one or more fixed wireless providers that deliver point-to-point Internet connectivity.  DSL service is offered across our footprint often at prices lower than our Internet services, although typically at speeds much lower than the minimum speeds we offer as part of our Spectrum pricing and packaging.  In addition, commercial areas, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, offer WiFi Internet service.  Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized WiFi Internet access networks.  In addition, providers are constructing open access networks that can deliver services from multiple underlying Internet service providers.  These options offer alternatives to cable-based Internet access.  We face terrestrial broadband Internet (defined by the FCC as at least 100 Mbps) competition from three primary competitors, AT&T, Frontier and Verizon, in approximately 25%, 9% and 6% of our operating footprint, respectively.  \nVideo Competition\nOur residential video service faces growing competition across our footprint from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices.  Increasingly, exclusive television content, including marquee content like live sporting events, is becoming available from sources other than traditional MVPDs.  These competitors include virtual MVPDs such as YouTube TV, Hulu Live, Sling TV, Philo and DirecTV Stream.  Other online video business models and products have also developed, some offered by programmers, including, (i) subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) services such as Netflix, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, (ii) programmer streaming applications such as Max, Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+, (iii) ad-supported free online video products, including YouTube and Pluto TV, some of which offer programming for free to consumers that we currently purchase for a fee, (iv) pay-per-view products, such as iTunes, and (v) additional offerings from mobile providers which continue to integrate and bundle video services and mobile products.  Historically, we have generally viewed SVOD online video services as complementary to our own video offering and, in the case of programmer streaming applications, we are packaging with the linear offerings.  However, services from virtual MVPDs and programmer streaming applications, as well as piracy and password sharing, negatively impact the number of customers purchasing our video product.\nOur residential video service also faces competition from DBS service providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all of our operating areas.  DBS providers offer satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that can be received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes.  DBS providers offer aggressive promotional pricing and video services \n12\nthat are comparable in many respects to our residential video service.  Our residential video service also faces competition from large telecommunications companies, primarily Verizon, which offer wireline video services in significant portions of our operating areas.\nMobile Competition\nOur mobile service faces competition from national mobile network operators including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US, Inc. (\"T-Mobile\"), as well as a variety of regional operators and mobile virtual network operators.  Most carriers offer unlimited data packages to customers while some also offer free or highly discounted devices.  Various operators also offer wireless Internet services delivered over networks which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speeds.  AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile continue to expand 5G mobile services, and consolidations in the telecom industry continue to increase competition as they seek to offer converged connectivity services similar to ours.  We also compete for retail activations with other resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers for resale.    \nVoice Competition\nOur residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers across our footprint, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email.  We also compete with “over-the-top” phone providers as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service.  The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying voice services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our residential voice service.  \nAdditional Competition\nIn some of our operating areas, other regional competitors have built networks that offer Internet, video, mobile and voice services that compete with our services.  We also compete with other sources of news, information and entertainment, including over-the-air television broadcast reception, live events, movie theaters and the Internet.  Competition is also posed by fixed wireless and satellite master antenna television systems serving MDUs, such as condominiums, apartment complexes, and private residential communities. \nBusiness Services\nWe face intense competition across each of our business services product offerings.  Our SMB Internet, video, mobile and voice services face competition from a variety of providers as described above.  Our enterprise solutions face competition from the competitors described above as well as cloud-based application-service providers, managed service providers and other telecommunications carriers, such as metro and regional fiber-based carriers.  \n \nAdvertising\nWe face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors.  Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new advertising platforms seek to attract the same advertisers.  We compete for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media, connected device platforms, direct-to-consumer ad-supported applications and online advertising companies and content providers.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality \nOur business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations.  Our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation service areas.  Our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels.  Our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season.  U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even-numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising.  Our capital expenditures and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth, network programs, specific projects and construction.  \n13\nLiberty Broadband Combination\nOn November 12, 2024, Charter, Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”), Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter, and Fusion Merger Sub 2, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “merger agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Charter will acquire Liberty Broadband through the merger of Fusion Merger Sub 2, Inc. with and into Liberty Broadband (the “merger”), with Liberty Broadband surviving the merger and becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Charter.  Immediately following the merger, Liberty Broadband, as the surviving corporation of the merger, will merge with and into Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC (the “upstream merger” and together with the merger, the “combination”), with Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC surviving the upstream merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter. \nAt the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”):\n•\neach share of (i) Liberty Broadband Series A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband Series A common stock”), (ii) Liberty Broadband Series B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband Series B common stock”), and (iii) Liberty Broadband Series C common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband Series C common stock” and together with the Liberty Broadband Series A common stock and the Liberty Broadband Series B common stock, the “Liberty Broadband common stock”), in each case, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as set forth in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive 0.236 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Charter Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Charter Class A common stock”); and\n•\neach share of Liberty Broadband Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband preferred stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded treasury shares as set forth in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive one share of newly issued Charter Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Charter preferred stock”). The Charter preferred stock will have substantially identical terms to the Liberty Broadband preferred stock, including a mandatory redemption date of March 8, 2039.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Liberty Broadband’s principal assets consist of approximately 45.3 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and its subsidiary GCI, LLC, which is comprised of one operating entity, GCI Holdings, LLC (“GCI”), Alaska’s largest communications provider.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, Liberty Broadband has agreed to spin off GCI by way of a distribution to the stockholders of Liberty Broadband prior to the closing of the combination (the “GCI divestiture”).  The GCI distribution is expected to be taxable to Liberty Broadband and its stockholders, with Charter bearing the corporate level tax liability upon completion of the combination.  However, to the extent such corporate level tax liability exceeds $420 million, Charter will be entitled under a tax receivables agreement to the portion of the tax benefits realized by GCI corresponding to such excess.  Liberty Broadband has debt of $2.6 billion (excluding debt at GCI) as of September 30, 2024 that will be repaid prior to closing or assumed by Charter, and $180 million in aggregate liquidation preference of Liberty Broadband preferred stock that will be converted into an equal amount of Charter preferred stock in the combination.  The companies currently expect the transaction to close on June 30, 2027, unless otherwise agreed, subject to the completion of the GCI spin-off and other customary closing conditions.\nFor additional information, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025, including the sections entitled “The Combination,” “The Merger Agreement” and “Other Agreements Related to the Combination - Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment” included therein.\nRegulation and Legislation \nThe following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry and our services for both residential and commercial customers.  Cable systems and related communications networks and services are extensively regulated by the federal government (primarily the FCC), certain state governments and many local governments.  A failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties.  Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative, or judicial rulings.  Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation and they are likely to do so again in the future.  We could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new laws, regulations or regulatory actions that do not equally impact our key competitors.  For example, Internet-delivered streaming video services compete with our traditional video service, but they are not subject to the same level of federal, state, and local regulation.  In addition, new Supreme Court \n14\ndecisions in 2024 may increase the likelihood that federal courts could vacate federal agency rules that would have been favorable or unfavorable to our business. We cannot provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future.  \nVideo\n \nService\nMust Carry/Retransmission Consent\nThere are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems.  Federal “must carry” regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster.  Alternatively, federal law includes “retransmission consent” regulations, by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for “retransmission consent,” which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions.  Popular stations routinely invoke “retransmission consent” and demand substantial compensation increases in their negotiations with cable operators, thereby significantly increasing our operating costs.\nPole Attachments\nThe Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), requires investor-owned utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits upon reasonable, non-discriminatory terms and at rates that are subject to either federal or state regulation.  Federal regulations, which apply in twenty-seven states, establish cost-based rental rates applicable to pole attachments used for cable or telecommunications services, including when offered together with Internet service, and at times establish mandatory timelines for processing pole access requests and limitations on make-ready costs that pole owners may charge for accommodating attachments.  The FCC's approach does not directly affect the rate in the twenty-three states that self-regulate, but many of those states have substantially the same rate for all communications attachments.  The federal pole attachment law does not extend to poles owned by electric cooperatives or municipal electric companies, but states are free to regulate these entities, and many do.  We sometimes face challenges getting access to poles in rural areas where upfront construction and make ready costs can be higher and where pole owners may be slow to grant our permit requests, especially when the FCC pole attachment rules do not apply or when FCC mandatory timelines do not apply, as is the case in most rural builds.\nOther FCC Regulatory Matters\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations cover a variety of additional areas applicable to our video services, including, among other things: (1) licensing of systems and facilities, including the grant of various spectrum licenses; (2) equal employment opportunity obligations; (3) customer service standards; (4) technical standards; (5) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; (6) restrictions on political advertising; (7) restrictions on advertising in children’s programming; (8) ownership restrictions; (9) posting of certain information on an FCC “public file” website, including but not limited to political advertising records, equal employment opportunity practices, compliance with children’s programming requirements, policies for commercial leased access, system information, and channel carriage information including disclosure of our ownership interests in channels we carry; (10) emergency alert systems; (11) inside wiring and contracts for MDU complexes; (12) accessibility of content, including requirements governing video-description and closed-captioning; (13) competitive availability of cable equipment; (14) the provision of up to 15% of video channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties; (15) public, education and government entity access requirements; and (16) disclosure of an aggregated monthly “all-in” price on customer bills and advertising materials that include the price of video programming.  Each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on our operations. \nThe FCC regulates spectrum usage in ways that could impact our operations including for microwave backhaul, broadcast, unlicensed WiFi and CBRS.  Our ability to access and use spectrum that may become available in the future is uncertain and may be limited by further FCC auction or allocation decisions.  While the FCC currently does not have auction authority, Congressional action to restore the FCC’s auction authority could direct spectrum be licensed in a manner beneficial to our competitors. New or additional spectrum obtained by other parties could lead to additional wireless competition to our existing and future services.\nIt is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems or the services delivered over cable systems and competing services in the future.  We cannot predict at this time what new requirements may be adopted and how such changes might impact our business.\n15\nCopyright\nThe carriage of television and radio broadcast signals by cable systems are subject to a federal compulsory copyright license.  The copyright law provides copyright owners the right to audit our payments under the compulsory license.  On December 16, 2024, the Copyright Office issued an order modifying the license’s royalty calculations and reporting obligations, however, we do not believe the impact of such modifications will be material to us.  The possible modification or elimination of this license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.\nFranchise Matters\nOur cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises, permits, and similar authorizations granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public rights-of-way.  \nCable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply.  The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions.  They generally contain provisions governing cable operations, franchise fees, access to and use of rights of way, system construction, maintenance, technical performance, customer service standards, supporting and carrying public, education and government access channels, and changes in the ownership of the franchisee.  Although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, certain federal protections benefit cable operators.  For example, federal law imposes a cap on franchise fees of 5% of gross revenues from the provision of cable services over the cable system.  The FCC has clarified that the value of in-kind contribution requirements set forth in cable franchises is subject to the statutory cap on franchise fees, and it reaffirmed that state and local authorities are barred from imposing franchise fees on revenues derived from non-cable services, such as Internet services, provided by cable operators over cable systems.    \nA number of states have adopted franchising laws that provide for state-issued franchising.  Generally, state-issued cable franchises are for a fixed term (or in perpetuity), streamline many of the traditional local cable franchise requirements and eliminate local negotiation and enforcement of terms.\nThe Communications Act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably deny renewals.  If we fail to obtain renewals of franchises representing a significant number of our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or our liquidity.  Similarly, if a franchising authority’s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the franchising authority may attempt to deny the transaction or impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent. \nInternet Service\nThe FCC originally classified broadband Internet access services, such as those we offer, as an “information service,” which exempted the service from traditional communications common carrier laws and regulations.  In 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access services as “telecommunications service” and, on that basis, imposed a number of “net neutrality” rules governing the provision of broadband service.  In 2017, the FCC eliminated the 2015 rules other than a transparency requirement that obligates us to disclose performance statistics and other service information to consumers.  In 2024, the FCC once again reclassified our Internet access services as telecommunications services.  The industry challenged the Order in court, and on January 2, 2025, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a decision invalidating the reclassification and the rules contained in the FCC’s Order.  It is also possible that the new Administration and Congress could adopt different requirements applicable to our Internet access services.  The application of new legal requirements to our Internet services could adversely affect our business.\nIn 2024, we became subject to new requirements to post standardized labels disclosing our network management policies and performance of our broadband Internet access services, similar to the format of food nutrition labels, for each of our currently available consumer Internet offerings. \nThe 2017 FCC decision reclassifying Internet access services also ruled that state regulators may not impose obligations similar to federal network neutrality obligations that the FCC eliminated, but this blanket prohibition was vacated by a federal Court of Appeals in 2019.  The court left open the possibility that individual state laws could be deemed preempted on a case-by-case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law.  Several states have adopted rules similar to the network neutrality requirements that were eliminated by the FCC, and the California rules were upheld in federal court.  \n16\nCalifornia has also adopted other regulations, including network resiliency rules to assure backup power is available after natural disasters and other outages, and it is considering the imposition of licensing requirements and service quality metrics on Internet service providers.  New York adopted legislation that would require Internet service providers to offer a discounted Internet service to qualifying low-income consumers.  A federal district judge enjoined enforcement as likely to be deemed rate regulation of Internet service that would be preempted by federal law, but that injunction was reversed by a federal Court of Appeals.  On December 16, 2024, the Supreme Court denied certiorari for the appeal of that decision.  The rules became enforceable by the Attorney General of New York on January 15, 2025.  We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal, what other legislation and regulations may be adopted by states, or how challenges to such requirements will be resolved.  \nIn October 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) adopted rules that would make it easier and faster for consumers to terminate subscription services, including all our services. These rules have been challenged in federal court, and we cannot predict the outcome of those challenges.  The application of these rules could adversely affect our business.\nIn November 2023, the FCC adopted new rules governing digital discrimination, pursuant to The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (the “IIJA”), to prevent discrimination of access to broadband Internet services. Most of these rules have become effective, but they are subject to ongoing legal challenges and could be modified or rescinded by the FCC in the new Administration.  California adopted digital discrimination rules in November 2024.  We cannot predict the outcome of legal challenges or whether the nature of practices that could be subject to enforcement under these rules could adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, the federal, state and local governments have offered billions of dollars in subsidies to companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be “unserved” or “underserved,” using funds from the FCC’s RDOF auction in 2020, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act (2020), The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”), and IIJA.  We support such subsidies, provided they are not directed to areas that are already served, and have sought and expect to continue to seek subsidies for our own broadband construction in unserved and underserved areas through programs including RDOF and those created pursuant to ARPA and, if regulatory requirements are reasonable, the IIJA.  We have been awarded over $2 billion in the RDOF auction and other federal, state and municipal grants that will partially fund, along with our substantial additional investment, the construction of new broadband infrastructure to over 1.7 million estimated passings.  Our awards through RDOF and ARPA include a number of regulatory requirements, such as serving as the carrier of last resort and completing increasingly larger portions of the network construction by certain dates. If we fail to meet these obligations, we could be subject to substantial government penalties.\nThe FCC has adopted rules for service providers to report broadband availability, pursuant to the Broadband Data Act.  Providers are required to report their service areas twice each year.  The service areas reported are subject to challenge.  A broadband provider who provides inaccurate maps or fails to respond properly to challenges may be subject to enforcement action by the FCC.  The FCC can also fine a provider for filing incorrect maps.   \nMobile Service \nOur Spectrum Mobile service offers mobile Internet access and telephone service.  We provide this service as a mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) using Verizon’s network and our network through Spectrum WiFi.  As an MVNO, we are subject to many of the same FCC regulations that apply to facilities-based wireless carriers, as well as certain state or local regulations, including (but not limited to): E911, local number portability, customer privacy, Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”), Universal Service Fund contributions, robocall mitigation and hearing aid compatibility and safety and emission requirements for mobile devices.   Spectrum Mobile’s broadband Internet access service is also subject to the FCC’s transparency rule and broadband labeling rules.  \nThe FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile service providers in the future, or impose new taxes or fees applicable to Spectrum Mobile, which could adversely affect the service offering or our business generally.  For example, California has proposed the imposition of service quality metrics on mobile services.\nWireline Voice Service\nThe  FCC has never classified the VoIP wireline telephone services we offer as “telecommunications services” that are subject to traditional federal common carrier regulation, but instead has imposed some of these regulatory requirements on a case-by-case basis, such as requirements relating to 911 emergency services (“E911”), CALEA (the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications), Universal Service Fund contributions, customer privacy and Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) protections, number portability, network and/or 911 outage reporting, rural call \n17\ncompletion, disability access, regulatory fees, back-up power, robocall mitigation and discontinuance of service.  It is possible that the FCC or Congress will impose additional federal requirements on our VoIP telephone services in the future.  \nOur VoIP telephone services are subject to certain state and local regulatory fees such as E911 fees and contributions to state universal service funds.  Additionally, to comply with RDOF program requirements, we have chosen in the RDOF areas to offer Lifeline VoIP telephone services subject to traditional federal and state common carrier regulations. We also offer Lifeline VoIP telephone services in portions of our California and New York service areas.  Except where we have chosen to offer VoIP telephone services in such a manner, we believe that our VoIP telephone services should be governed primarily by federal regulation.  The federal Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed our successful challenge to Minnesota's attempt to generally apply telephone regulation to our VoIP services, but that ruling is limited to the seven states in that circuit.  Some states have attempted to subject cable VoIP services, such as our VoIP telephone service, to state level regulation.  California has imposed reporting and other obligations on our VoIP services, including backup power requirements, and has proposed the imposition of service quality metrics on VoIP services.  California has recently adopted an order requiring providers of VoIP services to comply with new registration and/or certification requirements in order to conduct business in the state.  We have registered with or obtained certificates or authorizations from the FCC and the state regulatory authorities in those states in which we offer competitive voice services in order to ensure the continuity of our services.  However, it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved.  State regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our fixed wireline voice telephone services.\nPrivacy\n \nand Information Security Regulation\nThe Communications Act limits our ability to collect, use, and disclose customers’ personally identifiable information for our Internet, video, mobile and voice services.  We are subject to additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of consumer information.  All broadband and VoIP providers are also obliged by CALEA to configure their networks in a manner that facilitates the ability of state and federal law enforcement, with proper legal process authorized under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, to wiretap and obtain records and information concerning our customers, including the content of their communications.  Further, the FCC, FTC, and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of communications service providers, including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial emails.  The FTC currently has the authority, pursuant to its general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive acts and practices, to protect the privacy of Internet service customers, including our use and disclosure of certain customer information. \nOur operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security.  All states have data breach notification laws that would require us to inform individuals and regulators in the event of a breach that could impact personal information of our customers.  In the event of an information security breach, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures.  The FCC, the FTC and state attorneys general regularly bring enforcement actions against companies related to information security breaches and privacy violations.\nVarious security standards provide guidance to telecommunications companies in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks. We describe those standards in Item 1C. Cybersecurity - Risk Management and Strategy.  The FCC adopted rules expanding its cybersecurity guidelines and requirements.  These rules have been challenged in federal court and we cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or whether the rules could be modified by the new Administration.  The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has sought comment on the development of cyber incident reporting rules, pursuant to 2022 legislative requirements, that require critical infrastructure entities to report substantial cyber incidents within 72 hours of their discovery.\nMany states and local authorities have considered legislative or other actions that would impose restrictions on our ability to collect, use and disclose, and safeguard certain consumer information.  Many states have enacted comprehensive consumer data privacy laws, and some states have enacted issue-specific privacy laws covering health information and children's information.  For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) regulates companies’ collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of California residents and employees and authorizes enforcement actions by the California Attorney General and private class actions for data breaches.  The Maine Act to Protect Privacy of Online Customer Information, which regulates how Internet service providers use and disclose customers’ personal information and requires Internet service providers to take reasonable measures to protect customers’ personal information, became effective on July 1, 2020.  Data privacy laws subsequently have taken effect in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, and Utah, and are scheduled to become effective in Tennessee on July 1, 2025, Minnesota on July 31, 2025, Maryland on October 1, 2025, and Indiana, Kentucky, and Rhode Island on January 1, 2026.  \n18\nEach of these laws will regulate the way that companies collect, use, and share personal information about consumers.  Other state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation, and states with newly passed laws continue to consider amendments, that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business.  \nThe FTC has an ongoing Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to explore rules related to the collection, analysis, and monetization of consumers' information, as well as companies’ data security practices and related disclosures to consumers.  The FTC has also warned companies not to misuse consumers’ biometric information, with a broad definition of biometrics similar to Washington’s My Health My Data Act and the CCPA that treat biometrics as sensitive consumer information, and Illinois and Texas have also adopted laws regulating the use of such information.  The new Congress may also adopt new privacy and data security obligations that could supplement or preempt state privacy laws.  \nWe cannot predict whether any of the above efforts will be successful, challenged, upheld, vacated, or preempted, or how new legislation and regulations, if any, would affect our business.\nHuman Capital Management \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 94,500 active full-time equivalent employees.  The vast majority of our employees sell or service our products. We believe that attracting, developing and retaining our highly-skilled workforce is critical to successfully executing our operating strategy. With competitive wages, robust and affordable healthcare benefits, a generous retirement program with company match, and opportunities for job training and advancement, our employees develop skills and expertise necessary to build a long and successful career with us.  In addition, the diversity of the communities we serve is reflected in our workforce, which is a critical part of our success in serving these communities. We value the unique backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences of our employees. Embracing these differences brings us together for the common mission of exceeding our customers’ needs.  There are several ways in which we attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent, including:  \nRewarding Our Employees Competitively and Fairly\n•\nWe provide compensation packages that are market competitive, taking into account the location and responsibilities of the role. \n•\nAll hourly employees have a starting minimum wage of at least $20 per hour, which is well above any state or federal minimum wage level. \n•\nOver 80% of our employees are eligible for additional variable compensation based on their performance, including annual bonus eligibility for all frontline supervisors and other salaried employees not already on a sales commission or bonus plan.\n•\nWe provide high-quality, comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees. It is our priority to keep this coverage affordable for our employees and their families, and so for the last twelve years, we have absorbed the full premium cost increase for medical, dental, and vision coverage.\n•\nWe provide competitive financial benefits to all employees such as a 401(k) Plan with a dollar-for-dollar company match up to 6% of their eligible pay.  In addition, most of our employees are also eligible to receive an additional non-elective contribution to a Retirement Accumulation Plan equal to 3% of their eligible pay.\n•\nWe have a stock incentive plan and grant equity awards to eligible employees on an annual basis.\nDeveloping Our Workforce to Deliver the Best in Customer Experience\n•\nThe substantial skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees and our training of our customer-facing employees benefit our operations and performance. We offer thousands of learning experiences spanning leadership development, new hire, and professional skills training both online and in the classroom.\n•\nWe offer a tuition-free degree and certificate program, removing the financial barrier for employees to continue their education through convenient online learning.\n•\nWe also provide traditional tuition reimbursement of up to $10,000 per year for employees who want to pursue other outside programs.\n•\nMost of our customer-facing roles have the opportunity for upward advancement including through supervisory and leadership roles. Our Field Operations organization has a formalized self-progression structure where employees who maintain exceptional levels of performance can complete online coursework to advance to next level within their job family. \n•\nOur Broadband Technician Apprenticeship Program is one of our promising strategies for building our skilled workforce. This program, certified by the U.S. Department of Labor, is aligned with our broadband technician career progression and \n19\nincludes thousands of hours of on-the-job training along with classroom instruction. When enrolled employees complete the program, they become certified broadband technicians.\n•\nWe conduct annual talent planning to review the overall performance of our leaders and their potential to serve in larger, more complex roles. Executive leadership reviews the results of talent conversations, which open possibilities for career growth opportunities and cross-organizational movement. \nReflecting the Communities We Serve\n•\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion is based on our objective to reflect the markets, communities, and customers we serve, enabling us to deliver high-quality products and services that exceed our customers’ expectations, as well as foster an inclusive environment where all employees can thrive and have a long-term career with the company. \n•\nWe have five Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) focused on people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, employees with multicultural backgrounds, veterans and women. Open to all employees, these voluntary groups enable employees to engage in activities that support our culture of inclusion and contribute to business success. Our BRGs have empowered our team members to grow and succeed by providing networking, mentorship and skill-building opportunities for anyone who chooses to join.\n•\nSeveral initiatives promote inclusion and belonging in our workplace including the BRGs, educational opportunities that build the skills and competency of leaders to foster diverse and inclusive teams, as well as additional communications tools and resources.\n•\nOur efforts are guided by an external advisory council and an internal steering committee, with annual reporting to the Board of Directors.",
  "item7": "Item 7.  \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \nReference is made to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein.  In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Charter included in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nOverview \nWe are a leading broadband connectivity company and cable operator with services available to an estimated 57 million homes and businesses in 41 states through our Spectrum brand.  Over an advanced communications network, we offer a full range of state-of-the-art residential and business services including Spectrum Internet, TV, Mobile and Voice.  For small and medium-sized companies, Spectrum Business delivers the same suite of broadband products and services coupled with special features and applications to enhance productivity, while for larger businesses and government entities, Spectrum Enterprise provides highly customized, fiber-based solutions. Spectrum Reach delivers tailored advertising and production for the modern media landscape. We also distribute award-winning news coverage and sports programming to our customers through Spectrum Networks.  See “Part I. Item 1. Business — Products and Services” for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we lost 508,000 Internet customers while adding 2,117,000 mobile lines.  Our Internet customer growth was challenged by the end of the FCC’s ACP, lower customer move rates and the competitive environment.  While our retention programs for the customers impacted by the end of ACP subsidies have been successful in retaining the vast majority of ACP customers, the end of the ACP subsidy program has been disruptive to our business and resulted in customer losses during the year.  In September, Spectrum launched a new brand platform, Life Unlimited, which emphasizes the power of Spectrum’s advanced network and cutting-edge connectivity products and services along with a new and simplified pricing and packaging strategy that better utilizes its seamless connectivity and entertainment products to offer lower promotional and persistent bundled pricing to drive growth. Additionally, Spectrum announced new customer commitments focused on reliable connectivity, transparency, exceptional service and a focus on always improving.\nOur mobile line growth continued to benefit from our pricing and packaging strategy, including our Anytime Upgrade offering and Phone Balance Buyout program.  Our Internet and mobile product bundles, including Spectrum One, provide a differentiated connectivity experience by bringing together Spectrum Internet, Advanced WiFi and Unlimited Spectrum Mobile to offer consumers fast, reliable and secure online connections on their favorite devices at home and on the go in high-value packages.  Anytime Upgrade allows certain customers to upgrade their devices whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees and condition requirements.  Our Phone Balance Buyout program makes switching mobile providers easier by helping customers pay off balances on ported lines.\nWe spent $2.2 billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative during the year ended December 31, 2024 and activated approximately 393,000 subsidized rural passings.  We currently offer Spectrum Internet products with speeds up to 1 Gbps across our entire footprint.  Our network evolution initiative is progressing.  We are upgrading our network to deliver symmetrical and multi-gigabit speeds across our footprint and are now offering symmetrical speeds in all of our step 1 high split markets.  In 2024, we began offering certain seamless entertainment applications including, among others, Max, Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, ViX Premium and Tennis Channel Plus to customers in certain packages and reached agreements with several other programmers that will add Discovery+, Peacock, AMC+ and BET+ in certain packages in 2025.  We now have \n34\ncompleted deals with every major programmer to deliver better flexibility and greater value to our customers by including seamless entertainment applications with our Spectrum TV services at no additional cost.  We also continue to evolve our video product and are deploying Xumo stream boxes to new video customers.  Xumo combines a live TV experience with access to hundreds of content applications, and features unified search and discovery, along with a curated content offering based on a customer’s interests and subscriptions.  In September 2024, we launched our Life Unlimited brand platform which includes a new customer commitment that provides performance and service benchmarks and a new and simplified pricing structure designed to drive more value into our relationships.  \nBy continually improving our product set and offering consumers the opportunity to save money by switching to our services, we believe we can continue to penetrate our expanding footprint and sell additional products to our existing customers.  We see operational benefits from the targeted investments we made in employee wages and benefits to build employee skill sets and tenure, as well as the continued investments in digitization of our customer service platforms, all with the goal of improving the customer experience, reducing transactions and driving customer growth and retention.\nWe realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers; minor differences may exist due to rounding). \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nGrowth\nRevenues\n$\n55,085 \n$\n54,607 \n0.9 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n22,569 \n$\n21,894 \n3.1 \n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n13,118 \n$\n12,559 \n4.5 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Charter shareholders plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, other income (expense), net and other operating (income) expenses, net, such as special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets.  See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.     \nGrowth in total revenue was primarily due to mobile line growth and higher average revenue per customer, partly offset by lower customers.  Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations growth was driven by growth in revenue and decreases in operating costs and expenses, primarily programming expense, partly offset by an increase in mobile device and other mobile direct costs.   \nApproximately 90% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our Internet, video, mobile, voice and commercial services as well as regional sports and news channels.  Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers.  The remaining 10% of our revenue is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), sales of mobile and video devices, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, installation, VOD and pay-per-view programming, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \nCertain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of Charter’s Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the following disclosure.  We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows: \n•\nCapitalization of labor and overhead costs\n•\nIncome taxes\n•\nDefined benefit pension plans\n35\nCapitalization of labor and overhead costs  \nCosts associated with network construction or upgrades, placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide Internet, video or voice services, are capitalized.  Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor and certain indirect costs.  These indirect costs consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with support functions.  While our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis.  For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation.  The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred.  Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized. \nWe make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized.  We capitalized direct labor and overhead of $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data.  We calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity.  For example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities.  Overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities.  The impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.\nLabor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized.  Capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as: \n•\ndispatching a “truck roll” to the customer’s dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment;\n•\ncosts to package and ship new equipment to a customer's home for self-installation;\n•\nverification of serviceability to the customer’s dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer’s dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network);\n•\ncustomer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with the installation, replacement and betterment of equipment and materials to enable Internet, video or voice services; and\n•\nverifying the integrity of the customer’s network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer premise equipment, as well as testing signal levels at the utility pole or pedestal.\nJudgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized.  The primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities. \nWhile we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our operating practices could affect management’s judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future.  We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies.    \nIncome taxes \nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing loss carryforwards, including indefinite lived carryovers such as the Section 163(j) interest limitation. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and tax law, if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment. In determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a \n36\nreserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. There is considerable judgment involved in making such a determination. We recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain income tax positions as part of the income tax provision.  See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discussion.\nDefined benefit pension plans\nWe sponsor qualified and unqualified defined benefit pension plans that provide pension benefits to a majority of employees who were employed by TWC before the merger with TWC.  As of December 31, 2024, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets was $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and the net funded asset was recorded as a $125 million noncurrent asset, $3 million current liability and $15 million long-term liability.  As of December 31, 2023, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets was $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and the net funded asset was recorded as a $149 million noncurrent asset, $3 million current liability and $19 million long-term liability.  In June 2023, we purchased a buy-in group annuity contract from a highly rated insurer and in October 2023, we announced plans to fully terminate the qualified pension plan.  The benefit obligation for the qualified pension plan is determined on a plan termination basis for which it is assumed that a portion of eligible active and deferred vested participants will elect lump sum payments. \nPension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees’ years of service and compensation during their employment period.  Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions.  We have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period.  We use a December 31 measurement date for our pension plans. \nWe recognized net periodic pension cost of $23 million and $216 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Net periodic pension benefit or cost is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and mortality assumptions. We determined the discount rate used to compute pension cost based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio’s composition, past average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. We used a discount rate of 5.08% to determine the December 31, 2024 pension plan benefit obligation.  A decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $68 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024 and net periodic pension cost recognized in 2024 under our mark-to-market accounting policy.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic pension benefit for the year ended December 31, 2025 is expected to be 5.00%.  A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points to 4.75%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost of approximately $6 million.  See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discussion on these assumptions. \n37\nResults of Operations\nA discussion of changes in our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 2, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on Charter's investor relations website at ir.charter.com.\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share data): \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenues\n$\n55,085 \n$\n54,607 \nCosts and Expenses:\nOperating costs and expenses (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n33,167 \n33,405 \nDepreciation and amortization\n8,673 \n8,696 \nOther operating (income) expense, net\n127 \n(53)\n41,967 \n42,048 \nIncome from operations\n13,118 \n12,559 \nOther Income (Expense):\nInterest expense, net\n(5,229)\n(5,188)\nOther expense, net\n(387)\n(517)\n(5,616)\n(5,705)\nIncome before income taxes\n7,502 \n6,854 \nIncome tax expense\n(1,649)\n(1,593)\nConsolidated net income \n5,853 \n5,261 \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(770)\n(704)\nNet income attributable to Charter shareholders\n$\n5,083 \n$\n4,557 \nEARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHARTER SHAREHOLDERS:\nBasic\n$\n35.53 \n$\n30.54 \nDiluted\n$\n34.97 \n$\n29.99 \nWeighted average common shares outstanding, basic\n143,061,337 \n149,208,188 \nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted\n145,363,771 \n151,966,313 \nRevenues.\n \n Total revenues grew $478 million or 0.9% during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to growth in mobile lines, average revenue per customer and advertising sales, partly offset by lower customers.   \n38\nRevenues by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers; minor differences may exist due to rounding): \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nGrowth\nInternet\n$\n23,360 \n$\n23,032 \n1.4 \n%\nVideo\n15,126 \n16,351 \n(7.5)\n%\nMobile service\n3,083 \n2,243 \n37.5 \n%\nVoice\n1,437 \n1,510 \n(4.9)\n%\nResidential revenue\n43,006 \n43,136 \n(0.3)\n%\nSmall and medium business\n4,371 \n4,353 \n0.4 \n%\nEnterprise\n2,883 \n2,770 \n4.1 \n%\nCommercial revenue\n7,254 \n7,123 \n1.8 \n%\nAdvertising sales\n1,780 \n1,551 \n14.8 \n%\nOther\n3,045 \n2,797 \n8.8 \n%\n$\n55,085 \n$\n54,607 \n0.9 \n%\n \nThe increase in Internet revenues from our residential customers was attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nIncrease related to rate and product mix changes\n$\n493 \nDecrease in average residential Internet customers\n(165)\n$\n328 \nThe increase related to rate and product mix was primarily due to promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, partly offset by retention offers extended to customers that previously received an ACP subsidy.  Residential Internet customers decreased by 510,000 in 2024 compared to 2023.\nVideo revenues consist primarily of revenues from video services provided to our residential customers, as well as franchise fees, equipment service fees and video installation revenue.  The decrease in video revenues was attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nDecrease in average residential video customers\n$\n(1,418)\nIncrease related to rate and product mix changes\n193 \n$\n(1,225)\nResidential video customers decreased by 1,176,000 in 2024 compared to 2023.  The increase related to rate and product mix was primarily due to promotional rate step-ups, video rate adjustments that pass-through programming rate increases and $63 million of customer credits related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in 2023, partly offset by a higher mix of lower priced video packages within our video customer base and costs required by accounting principles to be allocated to seamless entertainment applications and netted within video revenue.  \n39\nThe increase in mobile service revenues from our residential customers is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nIncrease in average residential mobile lines\n$\n758 \nIncrease related to rate\n82 \n$\n840 \nResidential mobile lines increased by 2,049,000 in 2024 compared to 2023.  The increase related to rate is primarily related to successful conversion of free lines to paying lines and success of our Unlimited Plus plan.  \nThe decrease in voice revenues from our residential customers was attributable to the following (dollars in millions): \n2024 compared to 2023\nDecrease in average residential voice customers\n$\n(219)\nIncrease related to rate adjustments\n146 \n$\n(73)\nResidential wireline voice customers decreased by 1,076,000 in 2024 compared to 2023.  \nThe increase in SMB revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nIncrease related to rate and product mix changes\n$\n12 \nIncrease in average SMB customers\n6 \n$\n18 \nSMB customers decreased by 7,000 in 2024 compared to 2023.  \nEnterprise revenues increased $113 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in Internet PSUs.  Enterprise PSUs increased by 16,000 in 2024 compared to 2023. \nAdvertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels.  Advertising sales revenues increased $229 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in political ad revenue and advanced advertising partly offset by lower local and national ad revenue. \nOther revenues consist of revenue from mobile and video device sales, processing fees, regional sports and news channels (excluding intercompany charges or advertising sales on those channels), subsidy revenue, home shopping, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues.  Other revenues increased approximately $248 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to higher mobile device sales. \n40\nOperating costs and expenses\n.\n  The decrease in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, was attributable to the following (dollars in millions): \n2024 compared to 2023\nProgramming\n$\n(985)\nOther costs of revenue\n764 \nField and technology operations\n(30)\nCustomer operations\n(81)\nSales and marketing \n61 \nOther\n33 \n$\n(238)\nProgramming costs were approximately $9.7 billion and $10.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, representing 29% and 32% of total operating costs and expenses, respectively. Programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, premium, video on demand, and pay-per-view programming.  Programming costs decreased as a result of fewer video customers and a higher mix of lower cost video packages within our video customer base as well as costs required by accounting principles to be allocated to seamless entertainment applications and netted within video revenue, partly offset by contractual rate adjustments, including renewals and increases in amounts paid for retransmission consent as well as a $61 million benefit related to the temporary loss of Disney programming during 2023.  \nOther costs of revenue increased $764 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to higher mobile service direct costs and mobile device sales due to an increase in mobile lines. \nThe increase in other expense was attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nProperty tax and insurance\n$\n68 \nCosts to sell and service bulk properties\n24 \nStock compensation expense\n(41)\nAdvertising sales\n(17)\nOther \n(1)\n$\n33 \nProperty tax and insurance expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior period primarily as a result of an adjustment in 2023 related to favorable development on prior year workers' compensation claims. \nDepreciation and amortization.\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to certain assets acquired in acquisitions becoming fully depreciated offset by an increase in depreciation as a result of more recent capital expenditures. \nOther operating (income) expense, net.  \nThe change in other operating (income) expense, net was attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nSpecial charges, net\n$\n(59)\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net\n239 \n$\n180 \n41\nFor more information, see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nInterest expense, net. \n \nNet interest expense increased by $41 million in 2024 from 2023 primarily due to an increase in weighted average interest rates, partly offset by a decrease in weighted average debt.   \nOther expense, net.  \nThe change in other expense, net is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nNet periodic pension benefit (cost) (see Note 20)\n$\n193 \nLoss on equity investments, net (see Note 5)\n12 \nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net (see Note 8)\n4 \nGain (loss) on financial instruments, net (see Note 12)\n(79)\n$\n130 \nSee Note 14 and the Notes referenced above to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Item 1. Financial Statements” for more information.\nIncome tax expense.\n \nWe recognized income tax expense of $1.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\n. \n For more information, see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest.\n  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes represents A/N’s portion of Charter Holdings’ net income based on its effective common unit ownership interest.  For more information, see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nNet income attributable to Charter shareholders.\n \nNet income attributable to Charter shareholders was $5.1 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above. \nUse of Adjusted EBITDA\n \nand Free Cash Flow\nWe use certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.\nAdjusted EBITDA eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.    \nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.\nManagement and Charter’s Board of Directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n42\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, is as follows (dollars in millions): \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet income attributable to Charter shareholders\n$\n5,083 \n$\n4,557 \nPlus:  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n770 \n704 \nInterest expense, net\n5,229 \n5,188 \nIncome tax expense\n1,649 \n1,593 \nDepreciation and amortization\n8,673 \n8,696 \nStock compensation expense\n651 \n692 \nOther, net\n514 \n464 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n22,569 \n$\n21,894 \nNet cash flows from operating activities\n$\n14,430 \n$\n14,433 \nLess:  Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n(11,269)\n(11,115)\nChange in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures\n1,096 \n172 \nFree cash flow\n$\n4,257 \n$\n3,490 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nOverview \nWe have significant amounts of debt and require significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.  The principal amount of our debt as of December 31, 2024 was $93.8 billion, consisting of $10.3 billion of credit facility debt, $56.2 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $27.3 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. Our split credit rating allows us to access both the investment grade debt and the high yield debt markets.  In June 2024, our bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility to finance the purchase of equipment installment plan receivables with a number of financial institutions (the “EIP Financing Facility”).  As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the EIP Financing Facility was $1.1 billion.  For more information on the EIP Financing Facility, see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \nOur projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures.  Free cash flow was $4.3 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  See table below for factors impacting free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  As of December 31, 2024, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $6.3 billion and cash on hand was approximately $459 million.  We expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of our obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions among other considerations. Additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and Charter Operating’s revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs. \nWe continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow, including investing in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including expanding the capacity of our network, the expansion of our network through our rural broadband construction initiative, the build-out and deployment of our CBRS spectrum, and mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. Charter's target leverage of net debt to the last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA remains at 4 to 4.5 times Adjusted EBITDA, and up to 3.5 times Adjusted EBITDA at the Charter Operating first lien level. Charter's leverage ratio was 4.13 times Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2024.  As Adjusted EBITDA grows, we expect to increase the total amount of our indebtedness to maintain leverage within Charter's target leverage range.  Excluding purchases from Liberty Broadband discussed below, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Charter purchased in the public market approximately 2.7 million and 6.9 million shares, respectively, of Charter Class A common stock for approximately $822 million and $2.7 billion, respectively.  Since the beginning of its buyback program in September 2016 through the year ended December 31, 2024, Charter has purchased in the public market approximately 162.6 million \n43\nshares of Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $73.4 billion, including purchases from Liberty Broadband and A/N discussed below.\nIn February 2021, Charter and Liberty Broadband entered into a letter agreement (the “Existing LBB Letter Agreement”), as amended by the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment. The Existing LBB Letter Agreement implemented Liberty Broadband’s obligations under the Existing Stockholders Agreement to participate in share repurchases by Charter.  Under the Existing LBB Letter Agreement, Liberty Broadband sold to Charter, generally on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock representing an amount sufficient for Liberty Broadband’s ownership of Charter to be reduced such that it did not exceed the ownership cap then applicable to Liberty Broadband under the Existing Stockholders Agreement at a purchase price per share equal to the volume weighted average price per share paid by Charter for shares repurchased during such immediately preceding calendar month other than (i) purchases from A/N, (ii) purchases in privately negotiated transactions or (iii) purchases for the withholding of shares of Charter Class A common stock pursuant to equity compensation programs of Charter. The Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment sets forth, among other things, the terms of Liberty Broadband’s participation in Charter’s share repurchases during the period between the execution of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger agreement.  Pursuant to the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment, each month during the pendency of the proposed transaction, Charter will repurchase shares of Charter Class A common stock from Liberty Broadband in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $100 million and (ii) the Liberty Broadband minimum liquidity threshold as set forth in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment, provided that if any repurchase would reduce Liberty Broadband’s equity interest in Charter below 25.25% after giving effect to such repurchase or if all or a portion of such repurchase is not permitted under applicable law, then Charter shall instead loan to Liberty Broadband an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the repurchase amount that cannot be repurchased and (y) the Liberty Broadband minimum liquidity threshold as set forth in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment less the repurchase amount that is repurchased, with such loan on the terms set forth in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment.  From and after the date Liberty Broadband’s exchangeable debentures are no longer outstanding, the amount of monthly repurchases will be the lesser of (i) $100 million and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount needed, in the reasonable judgment of Charter, to maintain an unrestricted cash balance of Liberty Broadband and its subsidiaries (other than GCI, GCI Spinco and their respective subsidiaries) of $50 million plus (y) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Liberty Broadband margin loan.  The purchase price payable by Charter to Liberty Broadband in connection with such monthly repurchases will equal (i) the average price paid by Charter for shares of Charter Class A common stock repurchased during the immediately preceding calendar month (excluding shares repurchased from A/N and certain other excluded repurchases) or (ii) if Charter has not engaged in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock during the immediately preceding calendar month (other than any repurchases from A/N and certain other excluded repurchases), a purchase price based on a Bloomberg volume-weighted average price methodology proposed by Charter and reasonably acceptable to Liberty Broadband. Liberty Broadband will apply the proceeds from any such repurchases or borrowings from Charter to repay certain of its outstanding indebtedness in accordance with the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment. The Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment provides that Liberty Broadband will be exempt from the standstill restrictions and the ownership cap under the Existing Stockholders Agreement to the extent its ownership in Charter exceeds such ownership cap solely as a result of the repurchase provisions in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment.  Charter purchased from Liberty Broadband 1.0 million shares of Charter Class A common stock during each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 for approximately $335 million and $394 million, respectively.     \nIn December 2016, Charter and A/N entered into a letter agreement, as amended in December 2017 (the “A/N Letter Agreement”), that requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. A/N and Charter both have the right to terminate or suspend the pro rata repurchase arrangement on a prospective basis.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Charter Holdings purchased from A/N 0.6 million and 1.1 million Charter Holdings common units, respectively, for approximately $189 million and $427 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Charter had remaining board authority to purchase an additional $961 million of Charter’s Class A common stock and/or Charter Holdings common units, excluding purchases from Liberty Broadband.  Although Charter expects to continue to buy back its common stock consistent with its leverage target range, Charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital.  Purchases may include open market purchases, tender offers or negotiated transactions. \n44\nAs possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, geographic clustering of assets, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities.  However, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow increased $767 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior period due to the following (dollars in millions):\n2024 compared to 2023\nChanges in working capital, excluding mobile devices\n$\n1,156 \nIncrease in Adjusted EBITDA\n675 \nIncrease in cash paid for interest, net\n(311)\nIncrease in capital expenditures\n(154)\nChanges in working capital, mobile devices\n(144)\nIncrease in cash paid for taxes, net\n(138)\nOther, net\n(317)\n$\n767 \nOther, net primarily includes the payment of a litigation settlement during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\nHistorical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents.  \nWe held $459 million and $709 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  In addition, we held $47 million in restricted cash included in prepaid and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.\nOperating Activities.\n \n Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in cash paid for interest and taxes and the payment of litigation settlements in 2024, partly offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA.\nInvesting Activities.\n \nNet cash used in investing activities was $10.7 billion and $11.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The decrease in cash used was primarily due to changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures as a result of extended vendor payment terms in connection with our implementation of a supply chain financing program.\nFinancing Activities.\n \nNet cash used in financing activities increased $737 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the amount by which repayments of long-term debt exceeded borrowings, partly offset by a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest and borrowings under the EIP Financing Facility.\nCapital Expenditures\n \nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  Capital expenditures were $11.3 billion and $11.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The increase was primarily driven by an increase in line extensions in connection with our subsidized rural construction initiative, partly offset by a decrease in customer premise equipment.  See the table below for more details. \nWe currently expect full year 2025 capital expenditures to total approximately $12 billion, including line extensions of approximately $4.2 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.5 billion.  The actual amount of capital expenditures in 2025 will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of our network evolution and expansion initiatives, supply chain timing and growth rates in our residential and commercial businesses.\n45\nOur capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility.  In addition, our accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures increased $1.1 billion and $172 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \nThe following tables present our major capital expenditures categories in accordance with National Cable and Telecommunications Association (“NCTA”) disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December

The net proceeds were used to fund a concurrent tender offer to repurchase $2.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of Charter Operating's 4.908% senior secured notes due July 2025, to prepay Charter Operating's outstanding Term B-1 Loan and to pay related fees and expenses.  \nIn December 2024, Charter Operating entered into an amendment to its credit agreement to (i) establish a new Revolving Loan C (including by converting a portion of the existing Revolving Loan B commitments to Revolving Loan C commitments), (ii) convert a portion of the Term A-5 Loan to Term A-7 Loan and repay any remaining Term A-5 Loan that was not converted to Term A-7 Loan, and (iii) convert or replace a portion of the Term B-2 Loan with a new tranche of Term B-5 Loan and repay any remaining Term B-2 Loan that was not converted to Term B-5 Loan, among other amendments.  After giving effect to the amendment, (i) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loan B commitments is approximately $960 million, with pricing unchanged and maturing on August 31, 2027, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loan C commitments is $5.5 billion, with a pricing of SOFR plus 1.25% and maturing on March 15, 2030, (iii) the aggregate principal amount of Term A-7 Loan is approximately $4.5 billion, with a pricing of SOFR plus 1.25% and maturing on March 15, 2030, and (iv) the aggregate principal amount of Term B-5 Loan is approximately $2.5 billion, with a pricing of SOFR plus 2.25% and maturing on December 15, 2031.\nSee Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II.
