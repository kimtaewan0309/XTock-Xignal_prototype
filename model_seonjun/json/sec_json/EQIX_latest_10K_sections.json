Digital leaders harness our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. Equinix enables organizations to access all the right places, partners and possibilities they need to accelerate their advantage. Platform Equinix combines a global footprint of International Business Exchange\nTM \n(IBX\n®\n) and xScale\n® \ndata centers in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") regions, infrastructure and interconnection offerings, unique business and digital ecosystems and expert consulting and support. \nEquinix was incorporated on June 22, 1998 as a Delaware corporation and operates as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Al Avery and Jay Adelson founded Equinix as a network-neutral, multi-tenant data center (\"MTDC\") provider, where competing networks could connect and share data traffic to help scale the rapid growth of the early internet. The company’s name, Equinix (composed from the words \"equality,\" \"neutrality\" and \"internet exchange\"), reflects that vision. The founders believed they not only had the opportunity, but also the responsibility to create a company that would be the steward of some of the most important digital infrastructure assets in the world. Over two and a half decades later, we have expanded upon that vision to build Platform Equinix\n®\n, which we believe is unmatched in scale and reach. \nOur data centers around the world allow our customers to bring together and interconnect the infrastructure they need to fast-track their digital advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, accelerate the launch of digital offerings, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value. We enable them to differentiate by distributing infrastructure and removing the distance between clouds, users and applications in order to reduce latency and deliver a superior customer, partner and employee experience. The Equinix global platform, and the quality of our offerings, have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers and connect directly with each other. This adjacency creates a network effect that attracts new customers, continuously enhances our existing customers' value and enables them to capture further economic and performance benefits from our offerings.\n5\nTable of \nContents\nIn 2024, we opened 16 new data centers, inclusive of new xScale sites via our joint ventures. Our new data center openings included sites in the following metros: Barcelona, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Mumbai, New York, Osaka, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, Silicon Valley, Tokyo and Warsaw. When including an additional data center which opened in February 2025, this results in an increase in our total number of data center facilities to 268. Additional 2024 highlights include:\n•\nIn April, we sold the Silicon Valley 12 (“SV12”) data center site in connection with the formation of a new joint venture (\"JV\") to develop and operate the first xScale data center in the U.S. The facility will be built out in two phases and is expected to provide more than 28 MW of power capacity when completed.\n•\nIn July, we announced our entry into the Philippines with the planned acquisition of three data centers in Manila for a stated purchase price of $180 million, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to add more than 1,000 cabinets of capacity. This follows our recent expansions into Indonesia and Malaysia, enabling us to help businesses expand and capitalize on the digital opportunity of the fast-growing Southeast Asia region. \n•\nIn October, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture to develop and operate data centers in the Americas region, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions which were satisfied on October 30, 2024. With the $15.0 billion of capital expected to be raised through this joint venture, we expect to accelerate xScale deployment in the U.S., eventually adding more than 1.5 gigawatts of new capacity for hyperscale customers.\n•\nIn November, we announced plans to build our sixth data center in Singapore. This new high performance data center will feature a design built to efficiently compute intensive workloads like artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), supported by capabilities such as advanced liquid cooling. Expected to open in Q1 2027, the 9-story facility was awarded as part of Singapore's pilot Data Centre - Call for Application and will provide 20MW of power capacity when fully built.\nIndustry Trends: The rise of intelligent ecosystems\nThe digital economy is advancing rapidly, driven by exponential data growth, ecosystem collaboration and edge-to-cloud innovations.

This shift is being accelerated by the increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud architectures and the adoption of AI.\nHistorically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers that bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and carrier-neutral multi-tenant data centers, public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, large hyperscale cloud providers and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,400 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center solution providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, outsourced IT infrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has accelerated and is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business, the use of multiple cloud service providers and the adoption of AI.\nEquinix is differentiated in this market by offering customers a global platform that reaches over 30 countries and contains the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, including access to a leading share of cloud on-ramps and an increasingly diverse ecosystem of networks and cloud and IT service providers. This ecosystem creates a network effect, which improves performance and lowers the cost for our customers, enabling them to innovate and fast-track their digital success. This is a significant source of competitive advantage for Equinix. Additionally, as AI and cloud innovations fuel workload demands for hyperscale infrastructure and optimization across enterprises, our scalable, neutral, global platform offers one-of-a-kind solutions to the most pressing digital challenges in today’s market. Our platform enables customers to bring together physical and programmable technologies like compute, storage, network and applications to build the foundation for their company's digital success.\nCustomers\nOur customers include telecommunications carriers, mobile and other network services providers, cloud and IT services providers, digital media and content providers, financial services companies, and global enterprise ecosystems in various industries. We provide each company with access to a choice of business partners and solutions based on their colocation, interconnection and managed IT service needs, and we delivered 99.999%+ operational uptime across our global data centers in the previous fiscal year. As of December 31, 2024, we had over 10,000 customers worldwide.

Open to all employees, our nine EECNs are designed to provide meaningful learning opportunities, raise awareness of diverse perspectives, and strengthen connections across the organization. \nWe recognize that creating the best workplace and culture requires a global effort with localized approaches. As of 2024, we have 40 global WeAreEquinix teams, led by employee volunteers, who are empowered to create and promote belonging in locations across the world. Through both virtual and in-person connection, and in collaboration with the business and their local communities, these volunteer leaders create opportunities to support Wellbeing, Sustainability, and Community engagement. Across our EECNs and WeAreEquinix teams, we currently have 853 volunteer leaders who are working on strengthening community and belonging for our workforce.\nThe Equinix Foundation and Equinix Community Impact program promote connection and belonging by enabling employees to give back through volunteer services, donations and more, to the communities in which we work and live. In 2024, our employees volunteered over 37,500 hours, representing an increase of approximately 50% year-over-year. Since the launch of the Equinix Foundation in 2022, we have continued to focus on the advancement of digital inclusion— from access to technology and connectivity to the skills needed to thrive in today's digitally-driven world. \nWe believe our commitment to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and ethical behavior differentiates our business as much as our technology. We promote these high standards through a number of policies including the Equinix Code of Business Conduct. All employees are required to complete training in ethics and the company’s anti-bribery and corruption policies. In addition, we maintain a confidential ethics helpline where employees are encouraged to speak up if they have any questions or concerns that our code of conduct is being violated. We have a zero-tolerance, non-retaliation policy that protects our employees when they speak up.\nOur comprehensive approach to health and safety combines global policies, rigorous inspections and targeted training to foster a safe and supportive work environment.

For the discussion of 2022 items and 2023 results as compared to 2022 results, please refer to Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:\n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n•\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOverview \nWe provide a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge solutions platform with offerings that aim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. Global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on our IBX data centers and expertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix\n®\n for the ability to directly and securely interconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Our \n52\nTable of Contents\nrecent IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScale\nTM\n data center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 268 IBXs, including 20 xScale data centers and the MC1 data center that are held in unconsolidated joint ventures, across 74 markets around the world. We offer the following solutions:\n•\npremium data center colocation;\n•\ninterconnection and data exchange solutions;\n•\nedge solutions for deploying networking, security and hardware; and\n•\nremote expert support and professional services.\nOur data centers around the world allow our customers to bring together and interconnect the infrastructure they need to fast-track their digital advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, accelerate the launch of digital offerings, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value. We enable them to differentiate by distributing infrastructure and removing the distance between clouds, users and applications in order to reduce latency and deliver a superior customer, partner and employee experience. The Equinix global platform, and the quality of our offerings, have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers and connect directly with each other. This adjacency creates a network effect that attracts new customers, continuously enhances our existing customers' value and enables them to capture further economic and performance benefits from our offerings.\nIndustry Overview:\nWhile a large number of enterprises and service providers, such as hyperscale cloud service providers, own their own data centers, we believe the industry is shifting away from single-tenant solutions to customers outsourcing some or all of their IT housing and interconnection requirements to third-party facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. This shift is being accelerated by the increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud architectures and the adoption of artificial intelligence (“AI”).\nHistorically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers that bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and carrier-neutral multi-tenant data centers (\"MTDC\"), public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, large hyperscale cloud providers and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,400 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center solution providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, outsourced IT infrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has accelerated and is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business, the use of multiple cloud service providers and the adoption of AI. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 35 countries with the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.\nCapacity Trends:\nOur cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 78% and 79%, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption, which we expect to accelerate with the adoption of AI, has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our existing IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center, and in our ability to expand our footprint in existing and new markets. Additionally, global supply chain challenges could result in a lack of availability or delays in the delivery of data center equipment. These challenges have driven us to invest in and commit to future purchases in advance of our standard practice to mitigate risks associated with these supply chain issues. These \n53\nTable of Contents\nconstraints could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows and the growth opportunities presented by the adoption of new technologies, including AI.\nExpansion Opportunities:\nTo serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers and increased demand driven in part by the adoption of AI, we have entered into joint venture partnership arrangements across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions to develop and operate xScale data centers. \nStrategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, power availability and capacity, quality of the design, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to our standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.\nRevenue:\nOur business is primarily based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to five years in length, and thereafter automatically renews in one-year increments. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 90% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36%, 37% and 36% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur non-recurring revenues are primarily derived from fees charged from installations related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform for our customers, including our joint ventures. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total \n54\nTable of Contents\nrevenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. \nOperating Expenses:\nCost of Revenues.\n The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment, and security. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. Our costs of electricity may also increase as a result of the physical effects of climate change, global energy supply constraints, increased regulations driving alternative electricity generation due to environmental considerations or as a result of our election to use renewable energy sources. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nSales and Marketing.\n Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.\nGeneral and Administrative.\n Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and depreciation expense on back office systems.\nTaxation as a REIT: \nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT structure included a majority of our data center operations in the Americas and EMEA regions, as well as the data center operations in Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as TRSs. We have also included our share of the assets in xScale joint ventures, with the exception of Korea, in our REIT structure.\nAs a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed in the U.S., if at all, at the stockholder level. Depending on a stockholder's citizenship and residency, the income could be taxed by other jurisdictions as well. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes, as applicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to local income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\") for U.S. income tax purposes. We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gain tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. In addition, should we recognize any gain from \"prohibited transactions,\" we will be subject to tax on this gain at a 100% rate. \"Prohibited transactions,\" for this purpose, are defined as dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.\n55\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.\nOn each of March 20, 2024, June 19, 2024, September 18, 2024 and December 11, 2024, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $4.26 per share. We expect all of our 2024 quarterly distributions and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed our REIT taxable income recognized in 2024.\n2024 Highlights:\n•\nIn April, we sold the Silicon Valley 12 (“SV12”) data center site in connection with the formation of a new joint venture to develop and operate an xScale data center in the Americas region (the “AMER 2 Joint Venture”).

See Note 10 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n•\nIn November and December, we sold 755,298 shares on a spot basis under the 2024 ATM Program for approximately $697 million, net of commissions and other offering expenses. See Note 11\n \nwithin the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nIn order to provide a framework for assessing our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year actual change in results of operations with comparative changes on a constant currency basis. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion. \n56\nTable of Contents\nYears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 \nRevenues.\n Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions ($ in millions):\nYears Ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024\n%\n2023\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant Currency\nAmericas:\nRecurring revenues\n$\n3,647 \n42%\n$\n3,457 \n42%\n$\n190 \n5%\n6%\nNon-recurring revenues\n215 \n2%\n160 \n2%\n55 \n34%\n35%\n3,862 \n44%\n3,617 \n44%\n245 \n7%\n7%\nEMEA:\nRecurring revenues\n2,812 \n32%\n2,648 \n33%\n164 \n6%\n5%\nNon-recurring revenues\n155 \n2%\n190 \n2%\n(35)\n(18)%\n(19)%\n2,967 \n34%\n2,838 \n35%\n129 \n5%\n3%\nAsia-Pacific:\nRecurring revenues\n1,725 \n20%\n1,640 \n20%\n85 \n5%\n7%\nNon-recurring revenues\n194 \n2%\n93 \n1%\n101 \n109%\n112%\n1,919 \n22%\n1,733 \n21%\n186 \n11%\n12%\nTotal:\nRecurring revenues\n8,184 \n94%\n7,745 \n95%\n439 \n6%\n6%\nNon-recurring revenues\n564 \n6%\n443 \n5%\n121 \n27%\n28%\n$\n8,748 \n100%\n$\n8,188 \n100%\n$\n560 \n7%\n7%\nRevenues \n($ in millions)\nAmericas Revenues.\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Americas revenues increased by $245 million or 7% (7% on a constant currency basis).

Growth in Asia-Pacific revenues was primarily due to: \n•\n$111 million of incremental revenues from non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures; \n•\napproximately $23 million of incremental revenues generated from IBX data centers which opened within the twelve months ended December 31, 2024; and\n•\nan increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. \nThese increases were partially offset by net power price decreases in response to the decreased cost of utilities, as noted below under cost of revenues. \nCost of Revenues. \nOur cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 by geographic regions were as follows ($ in millions):\nYears Ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024\n%\n2023\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant Currency\nAmericas\n$\n1,802 \n41%\n$\n1,617 \n38%\n$\n185 \n11%\n12%\nEMEA\n1,674 \n37%\n1,653 \n39%\n21 \n1%\n1%\nAsia-Pacific\n991 \n22%\n958 \n23%\n33 \n3%\n5%\nTotal\n$\n4,467 \n100%\n$\n4,228 \n100%\n$\n239 \n6%\n6%\nCost of Revenues \n($ in millions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)\n58\nTable of Contents\nAmericas Cost of Revenues. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Americas cost of revenues increased by $185 million or 11% (12% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to:\n•\napproximately $64 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions and acceleration of depreciation expense for certain assets with shortened useful lives; \n•\n$37 million of higher costs to provide non-recurring services; \n•\n$26 million of higher property tax expense;\n•\n$25 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth;\n•\n$24 million of higher utilities costs, driven by both increases in power costs and higher utility usage; and\n•\n$21 million of higher rent and facilities costs.\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in one-time software expenses related to our managed services business and other miscellaneous costs.\nEMEA Cost of Revenues. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, EMEA cost of revenues increased by $21 million or 1% (1% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to:\n•\n$27 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions and acceleration of depreciation expense for certain assets with shortened useful lives; and\n•\n$11 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth.\nThese increases were substantially offset by lower utilities costs, driven by decreases in power costs.\nAsia-Pacific Cost of Revenues.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased by $33 million or 3% (5% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to:\n•\n$32 million of costs to provide non-recurring services; and\n•\n$19 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions and acceleration of depreciation expense for certain assets with shortened useful lives. \nThese increase was partially offset by lower utilities costs, driven by decreases in power costs and lower utility usage in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.\nWe expect cost of revenues to increase across all three regions in line with the growth of our business, including from the impact of acquisitions.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n.\n Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024\n and \n2023 by geographic regions were as follows ($ in millions):\nYears ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024\n%\n2023\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant Currency\nAmericas\n$\n575 \n65%\n$\n552 \n64%\n$\n23 \n4%\n4%\nEMEA\n199 \n22%\n195 \n23%\n4 \n2%\n2%\nAsia-Pacific\n117 \n13%\n108 \n13%\n9 \n8%\n9%\nTotal\n$\n891 \n100%\n$\n855 \n100%\n$\n36 \n4%\n4%\n59\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n($ in millions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)\nAmericas Sales and Marketing Expenses\n. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Americas sales and marketing expenses increased by $23 million or 4% (4% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:\n•\n$7 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, attributable to headcount growth;\n•\n$7 million of higher travel and entertainment expenses; and\n•\n$6 million of higher advertising costs including for online ads, design services and marketing research.\nEMEA Sales and Marketing Expens\nes.\n \nOur EMEA sales and marketing expenses did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAsia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing increased by $9 million or 8% (9% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation attributable to headcount growth and higher bad debt expense.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives across our three regions in line with the growth of our business. We expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than those of our other regions since certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the U.S.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. \nOur general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024\n and \n2023 by geographic regions were as follows ($ in millions):\nYears Ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024\n%\n2023\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant Currency\nAmericas\n$\n1,204 \n68%\n$\n1,106 \n67%\n$\n98 \n9%\n9%\nEMEA\n335 \n19%\n321 \n19%\n14 \n4%\n4%\nAsia-Pacific\n227 \n13%\n227 \n14%\n— \n—%\n—%\nTotal\n$\n1,766 \n100%\n$\n1,654 \n100%\n$\n112 \n7%\n7%\n60\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n($ in millions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)\nAmericas General and Administrative Expense\ns. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Americas general and administrative expenses increased by $98 million or 9% (9% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:\n•\n$54 million of higher depreciation expense associated with back-office systems to support the growth of our business;\n•\n$40 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth;\n•\n$14 million of higher consulting and legal fees; and\n•\n$11 million of higher software costs.\nThese increases were partially offset by an $18 million decrease in rent expense primarily due to one-time termination costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 associated with the consolidation of office space.\nEMEA General and Administrative Expenses.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, EMEA general and administrative expenses increased by $14 million or 4% (4% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation driven by headcount growth.\nAsia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses.\n \nOur Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGoing forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase across all three regions as we continue to invest in our operations to support our growth, including investments to enhance our technology platform, to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and to integrate recent acquisitions. Additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located in the U.S., we expect the Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than those of other regions.\nRestructuring Charges. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $31 million primarily related to severance and other employee costs. These charges were incurred in relation to two initiatives. First, we substantially completed a restructuring plan to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas (the \"Q4 2024 Restructuring Plan\"). Second, we announced the decision to make Equinix Metal no longer commercially available as a product and to wind down operations that support this product by June 2026 (the \"Equinix Metal Wind Down\"). We expect to incur approximately $6 million to $10 million of incremental costs as a result of the Equinix Metal Wind Down. We did not record any restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 16 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n61\nTable of Contents\nTransaction Costs\n.\n During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded transaction costs of $50 million and $13 million, respectively. These transaction costs primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of new joint ventures. See Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nImpairment Charges. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of $233 million as a result of the Equinix Metal Wind Down and current and projected future losses at a Hong Kong IBX. Impairment charges of $166 million, $38 million and $29 million were recorded on property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and intangible assets, respectively. See Note 17 within the\n \nConsolidated Financial Statements. \nGain or Loss on Asset Sales.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a gain of $18 million, related to the sale of the Silicon Valley 12 (\"SV12\") data center. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not record a significant amount of gain or loss on asset sales. See Note 5\n \nwithin the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIncome from Operations. \nOur income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2024\n \nand\n \n2023 by geographic regions were as follows ($ in millions):\nYears Ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024\n%\n2023\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant Currency\nAmericas\n$\n105 \n8%\n$\n330 \n23%\n$\n(225)\n(68)%\n(67)%\nEMEA\n730 \n55%\n674 \n47%\n56 \n8%\n6%\nAsia-Pacific\n493 \n37%\n439 \n30%\n54 \n12%\n15%\nTotal\n$\n1,328 \n100%\n$\n1,443 \n100%\n$\n(115)\n(8)%\n(8)%\nAmericas Income from Operations\n.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, Americas income from operations decreased by $225 million or 68% (67% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to impairment and restructuring charges of $127 million and $21 million, respectively, as well as higher depreciation expense, utilities costs and other costs to support business growth. These were partially offset by higher revenues as a result of non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures, IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above.\nEMEA Income from Operations.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, EMEA income from operations increased by $56 million or 8% (6% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, partially offset by impairment charges of $19 million, as described above.\nAsia-Pacific Income from Operations.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, Asia-Pacific income from operations increased by $54 million or 12% (15% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures, IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as well as lower utilities costs. These were partially offset by impairment charges of $87 million, as described above.\nInterest Income.\n Interest income increased to $137 million with an average yield of 5.89% for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $94 million with an average yield of 4.11% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to interest income earned on time deposits as well as on the AMER 2 Loan further described in Note 15 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Expense.\n Interest expense increased to $457 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $402 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to debt issuances during the year, including:\n•\nthe issuance of the 5.500% Senior Notes due 2034 in the second quarter of 2024;\n•\nthe issuances of the 3.650% Euro Senior Notes due 2033 and the 1.558% Swiss Franc Senior Notes due 2029 in the third quarter of 2024; and\n•\nthe issuances of the 3.250% Euro Senior Notes due 2031 and the 3.625% Euro Senior Notes due 2034 in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n62\nTable of Contents\nThis increase was further driven by an increase in the variable interest rate on our GBP term loan. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we capitalized $36 million and $26 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. See Note 10 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Expense.\n For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded net other expense of $17 million, largely driven by our share of losses incurred on our equity method investments in our xScale joint ventures. We did not record a significant amount of net other expense during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGain or Loss on Debt Extinguishment.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $16 million of net loss on debt extinguishment primarily due to the modification of a financing obligation on a property in the Americas region. We did not record a significant amount of loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIncome Taxes.\n We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As such, other than certain state income taxes and foreign income and withholding taxes, no provision for income taxes has been included for our REIT and QRSs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nWe have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that may not be REIT compliant.\nU.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations, regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs, have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $161 million and $155 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 16.5% and 13.8%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The higher effective tax rate in 2024 as compared to 2023 is primarily driven by the increasing losses in certain entities in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, of which full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets were assessed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we had a favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of approximately $8 million resulting from the settlement of tax audits in the EMEA region. In 2023, we had a favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of approximately $14 million resulting from the settlement of tax audits in the EMEA region.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n.\n Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset sales. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 by geographic regions was as follows ($ in millions):\nYears Ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024\n%\n2023\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant Currency\nAmericas\n$\n1,709 \n41 \n%\n$\n1,614 \n44 \n%\n$\n95 \n6 \n%\n7 \n%\nEMEA\n1,378 \n34 \n%\n1,251 \n34 \n%\n127 \n10 \n%\n9 \n%\nAsia-Pacific\n1,010 \n25 \n%\n837 \n22 \n%\n173 \n21 \n%\n22 \n%\nTotal\n$\n4,097 \n100%\n$\n3,702 \n100%\n$\n395 \n11 \n%\n11 \n%\nAmericas Adjusted EBITDA.\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased by $95 million or 6% (7% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures, IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above.\n63\nTable of Contents\nEMEA Adjusted EBITDA. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by $127 million or 10% (9% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, and lower utilities costs, as described above.\nAsia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA increased by $173 million or 21% (22% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures, IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, and lower utilities costs, as described above.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing results of operations may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. \nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze us effectively. \nInvestors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. \nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment throughout its useful life. Construction costs in future periods are primarily incurred with respect to additional IBX data centers. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our results of operations when evaluating our operations. \nIn addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We also exclude restructuring charges. Such charges include employee severance, facility closure costs, lease or other contract termination costs and advisory fees related to the realignment of our management structure, operations or products. We also exclude impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Additionally, we exclude transaction costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to enhance the comparability of our financial results to our historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing our long-term performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, \n64\nTable of Contents\nimpairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and transaction costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods. Finally, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, and the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our results of operations with those of other companies. \nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset sales as presented below (in millions):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n814 \n$\n969 \n$\n705 \nIncome tax expense\n161 \n155 \n124 \nInterest income\n(137)\n(94)\n(36)\nInterest expense\n457 \n402 \n356 \nOther expense\n17 \n11 \n51 \nLoss on debt extinguishment \n16 \n— \n— \nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense\n2,011 \n1,844 \n1,740 \nStock-based compensation expense\n462 \n407 \n404 \nRestructuring charges\n31 \n— \n— \nImpairment charges\n233 \n— \n— \nTransaction costs\n50 \n13 \n22 \n(Gain) loss on asset sales\n(18)\n(5)\n4 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n4,097 \n$\n3,702 \n$\n3,370 \nOur adjusted EBITDA results have increased each year in total dollars due to the factors discussed earlier in \"Results of Operations\", as well as due to the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature, as also discussed in \"Overview\".\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\") and AFFO\nWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.\nIn presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax \n65\nTable of Contents\npositions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance.\nOur FFO and AFFO were as follows (in millions): \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n814 \n$\n969 \n$\n705 \nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n1 \n— \n— \nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n815 \n969 \n705 \nAdjustments:\nReal estate depreciation\n1,239 \n1,143 \n1,105 \n(Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property\n(20)\n1 \n7 \nAdjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures\n27 \n17 \n10 \nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n2,061 \n$\n2,130 \n$\n1,827 \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n2,061 \n$\n2,130 \n$\n1,827 \nAdjustments:\nInstallation revenue adjustment\n(4)\n4 \n18 \nStraight-line rent expense adjustment\n(3)\n12 \n16 \nContract cost adjustment\n(27)\n(47)\n(53)\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts\n20 \n19 \n18 \nStock-based compensation expense\n462 \n407 \n404 \nStock-based charitable contributions\n3 \n3 \n49 \nNon-real estate depreciation expense\n562 \n494 \n427 \nAmortization expense\n208 \n208 \n205 \nAccretion expense adjustment\n2 \n(1)\n3 \nRecurring capital expenditures\n(250)\n(219)\n(189)\nLoss on debt extinguishment \n16 \n— \n— \nRestructuring charges\n31 \n— \n— \nTransaction costs\n50 \n13 \n22 \nImpairment charges\n233 \n2 \n1 \nIncome tax expense adjustment \n(2)\n(12)\n(31)\nAdjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures\n(6)\n6 \n(3)\nAFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n3,356 \n$\n3,019 \n$\n2,714 \nOur AFFO results have improved due to the factors discussed earlier in \"Results of Operations,\" as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in \"Overview.\"\nConstant Currency Presentation\nOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, the \n66\nTable of Contents\nU.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Japanese yen, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue and operating income, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, the U.S. dollar was weaker relative to the British Pound, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency impact on revenue and operating income, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations. To present this information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2023 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2024 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2024 with the year ended December 31, 2023). \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCustomer collections are our primary source of cash. We believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections. As of December 31, 2024, our principle sources of liquidity were $3.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition to our cash balance, we had $3.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $4.0 billion revolving facility and general access to both public and private debt and the equity capital markets. We also have additional liquidity available to us from our 2024 ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time our common stock in \"at the market\" transactions on either a spot or forward basis. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.3 billion available for sale remaining under the 2024 ATM Program.\nWe believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and external financing sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, distribution of dividends, completion of our publicly-announced acquisitions, ordinary costs to operate the business, and expansion projects.\nAs we continue to grow, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures, provided that we have or can access sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities. We may elect to access the equity or debt markets from time to time opportunistically, particularly if financing is available on attractive terms. We will continue to evaluate our operating requirements and financial resources in light of future developments.\nCash Flow\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,249 \n$\n3,217 \n$\n32 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(3,937)\n(3,224)\n(713)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n1,723 \n211 \n1,512 \nOperating Activities\nOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues.

Net cash provided by operating activities \n67\nTable of Contents\nincreased by $32 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily driven by improved results of operations partially offset by increases in cash paid for costs and operating expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $713 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to:\n•\n$520 million in purchases of short-term investments;\n•\n$285 million increase in capital expenditures; and\n•\n$261 million investment in a loan receivable.\nThis increase was partially offset by $170 million in proceeds from the sale of assets to our joint ventures.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily driven by:\n•\n$1.9 billion increase in proceeds from senior notes; and\n•\n$939 million increase in proceeds from the 2022 and 2024 ATM Programs.\nThe increase was partially offset by $1.0 billion in repayment of senior notes and an increase of $268 million in dividend distributions.\nMaterial Cash Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2024, our principal commitments were primarily comprised of:\n•\napproximately $14.7 billion of principal from our senior notes (gross of debt issuance costs and debt d\nis\ncounts);\n•\napproximately $3.5 billion of interest on mortgage payable, other loans payable, senior notes and term loans, based on their respective interest rates and recognized over the life of these instruments, and the credit facility fee for the revolving credit facility; \n•\n$649 million of principal from our term loans, mortgage payable and other loans payable (gross of debt issuance costs and debt discounts); \n•\napproximately $5.3 billion of total lease payments, which represents lease payments under finance and operating lease arrangements, including renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised;\n•\napproximately $2.9 billion of unaccrued capital expenditure contractual commitments, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open IBX data center expansion projects prior to making them available to customers for installation, the majority of which is payable within the next 12 months; and\n•\napproximately $2.1 billion of other non-capital purchase commitments, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2025 and beyond, the majority of which is payable within the next two years.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity, including our expected future operating cash flows, are sized to adequately meet both the near and long-term material cash commitments for the foreseeable future. For further information on maturities of lease liabilities and debt instruments, see Notes 9 and 10, respectively,\n \nwithin the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Contractual Obligations\nWe have additional future equity contributions and loan commitments to our joint ventures. For additional information, see the \"Equity Method Investments\" in Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2024. For additional information, see “Maturities of Lease Liabilities” in Note 9 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n68\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that application of the following accounting policies involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n•    Accounting for income taxes;\n•    Accounting for business combinations;\n•    Accounting for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; \n•    Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and\n•    Accounting for leases.\n69\nTable of Contents\nDescription\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAccounting for Income Taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as tax attributes such as net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled, and the tax attributes to be utilized.\nThe accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future tax consequences. \nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realizable, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.\nThis assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income, 3) taxable income in carryback years permitted by the tax law, and 4) tax planning strategies.\nIn assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.\nFor purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins and projected capital expenditure.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $291 million and $332 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a total valuation allowance of $277 million and $221 million, respectively. If and when we increase or reduce our valuation allowances, it may have an unfavorable or favorable impact, respectively, to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by jurisdiction, in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we established full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the AMER region as part of our assessment of the realization of such deferred tax assets. We do not expect these deferred tax assets to be realizable in the foreseeable future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we established full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the EMEA region as part of the purchase accounting determination for the assets we acquired during the year. We do not expect these deferred tax assets to be realizable in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $57 million and $70 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unrecognized tax benefit decreased by $13 million and $19 million, respectively,  primarily due to the settlements of tax audits and lapse of statute of limitations in the EMEA region. The unrecognized tax benefits of $57 million as of December 31, 2024, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized.\n70\nTable of Contents\nDescription\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill.\nWe use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and judgments to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. \nDuring the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the acquisition of Entel Peru data centers in the third quarter of 2022 and MainOne in West Africa and Entel Chile data centers in the second quarter of 2022. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions were finalized during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods. \nAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. \nWe complete an annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values.\nWe do not have any significant indefinite-lived intangible assets for which an impairment assessment would have a material impact on our financial statements.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at the asset group level along with property, plant and equipment as discussed below.\nTo perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to bypass the optional analysis of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test using a discounted cash flow method as an income approach, and a market approach. Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, forecasted operating results, risk-adjusted discount rates, the determination of appropriate market comparables, future economic conditions and other market data. We periodically review our assessment of our reporting units to determine if changes in facts and circumstances warrant changes to our conclusions. There were no specific factors present in 2024 or 2023 that indicated a potential goodwill impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2024, goodwill attributable to the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units was $2.6 billion, $2.3 billion and $596 million, respectively.\nFuture events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs could result in an impairment charge in future periods.\nThe balance of our other intangible assets, net, for years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. We recorded $29 million impairment charges on finite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n71\nTable of Contents\nDescription\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAccounting for Property, Plant and Equipment\nWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). \nAccounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period over which to depreciate such assets and assessing such assets for potential impairment. We assess our property, plant and equipment for potential impairment together with finite lived-intangible assets and lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets at the asset group level. \nJudgments are required in arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset and changes to these estimates could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.  We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. \nWe review our asset groups on an ongoing basis to identify any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset group is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset group or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data.  If a potential impairment trigger is identified, the measurement of an impairment loss requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows, and assumptions about the market price of assets. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had property, plant and equipment of $19.2 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively. We evaluated the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment, and made certain revisions to these estimates during the year ended December 31, 2024. We did not revise these estimates during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We recorded $166 million impairment charges on property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAccounting for Leases\nA significant portion of our data center spaces, office spaces and equipment are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendments, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting, including assessing if it should be classified as an operating or finance lease.\nROU assets are also assessed for impairment at the asset group level along with property, plant and equipment as discussed above. \nDetermination of the accounting treatment, including the result of the lease classification test for each new lease, lease amendment, or lease term reassessment is dependent on a variety of judgments, such as identification of lease and non-lease components, allocation of total consideration between lease and non-lease components, determination of lease term, including assessing the likelihood of lease renewals, valuation of leased property, and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. The judgments used in the accounting for leases are inherently subjective; different assumptions or estimates could result in different accounting treatment for a lease.\nLease assumptions and estimates are determined and applied at the inception of the leases or at the lease modification or reassessment date. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total operating lease ROU assets were $1.4 billion and operating lease liabilities were $1.5 billion, respectively. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, finance lease ROU assets were $2.2 billion and finance lease liabilities were $2.3 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded finance lease costs of $294 million, $280 million and $273 million, respectively, and recorded rent expense of approximately $229 million, $243 million and $214 million, respectively.\nWe recorded $38 million impairment charges on operating lease ROU assets during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n72\nTable of Contents",
