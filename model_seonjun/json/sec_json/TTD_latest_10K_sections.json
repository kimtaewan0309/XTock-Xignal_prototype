  "item1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nThe Trade Desk, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “The Trade Desk”) offers a self-service, cloud-based ad-buying platform that empowers our clients to plan, manage, optimize and measure more expressive data-driven digital advertising campaigns. Our platform allows clients to execute integrated campaigns across ad formats and channels, including connected television (“CTV”) and other video, display, audio, and native, on a multitude of devices, such as televisions, streaming devices, mobile devices, computers and digital-out-of-home devices. Our platform’s integrations with major inventory, publisher and data partners provide ad buyers reach and decisioning capabilities, and our enterprise application programming interfaces (“APIs”) enable our clients to customize and expand platform functionality.\nOur clients are advertising agencies, advertisers and other service providers for agencies or advertisers, with whom we enter into ongoing master services agreements (“MSAs”). We generate revenue by charging our clients a platform fee generally based on a percentage of our clients’ total platform spend and from providing value-added services and data to support their advertising campaigns.\nThe Trade Desk was originally incorporated in 2009 and is a Nevada corporation. We are headquartered in Ventura, California.\nOur Industry\nWe believe that several trends in the advertising industry, happening in parallel, will result in programmatic advertising — the buying and selling of advertising inventory using algorithmic software that automates the process — being the predominant means by which companies reach consumers online and through connected devices.\nSome of the key industry trends are:\nMedia is Increasingly Digital.\n Media is increasingly digital as a result of advances in technology and changes in consumer behavior. This shift has enabled unprecedented options for advertisers to target and measure their advertising campaigns across nearly every media channel and connected device. The digital advertising market is a significant and growing part of the total advertising market. As media becomes increasingly digital, decisions based on consumer and behavioral data are more prevalent. \nFragmentation of Audience.\n As digital media grows, audience fragmentation is accelerating. A growing “long tail” of mobile applications, social media platforms, streaming services and websites presents a challenge for advertisers trying to reach a large audience. Additionally, the number of devices used by individual consumers has increased. Both of these fragmentation trends are opportunities for technology companies that can consolidate and simplify media buying options for advertisers and agencies.\nEmergence of CTV. \nWe are witnessing a generational shift from linear television to CTV as Internet and television programming converge. New technologies support seamless delivery of streaming video content, accelerating consumers’ demand to watch what they want, when they want and where they want. We believe that this increased demand for CTV will bring about new opportunities for content owners and advertisers to connect with consumers, including through ad-supported subscription models, and will further drive the shift towards data-driven advertising. \nIncreased Use of Data and Measurement.\n Advances in software and hardware, and the ubiquitous use of the Internet, have enabled the generation of user data at an unprecedented scale. Data vendors and other organizations are able to collect this user data across a wide range of Internet properties and connected devices, aggregate it and combine it with other data sources. This data is pseudonymized and made available within seconds based on specific parameters and attributes. Advertisers can integrate this targeting data with their own data or an agency’s proprietary data relating to client attributes, the advertisers’ own store locations and other related characteristics. Through the use of these types of data sources, together with measurement features, including real-time feedback on consumer reactions to the ads, programmatic advertising increases the value of impressions for advertisers and inventory owners, and viewers receive more relevant ads. At the same time, new laws, enforcement of existing laws, and self-regulatory rules regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information continue to impact these practices.\n5\nTable of Contents\nAutomation of Ad Buying.\n The growing complexity of digital advertising and the laws and rules that govern it have increased the need for automation. Technology that enables fast, accurate and cost-effective decision making through the application of computer algorithms that use extensive data sets has become critical for the success of digital advertising campaigns. Using programmatic inventory buying tools, advertisers are able to automate their campaigns, providing them with better price discovery on an impression-by-impression basis. As a result, advertisers are able to bid on and purchase the advertising inventory they value the most, pay less for advertising inventory they do not value as much and abstain from buying advertising inventory that does not fit their campaign parameters. \nDigital Advertising Ecosystem\nThe digital advertising ecosystem is divided into buyers, sellers and marketplaces, which can be further segmented on the basis of whether participants provide services or technology. We believe that participants on the buy side or sell side should be advocates for their buyers or sellers, while those in the marketplace business should act as a referee or have market-driven incentives to protect or enhance the integrity of the marketplace. \nWhat We Do\nWe empower ad buyers by providing a self‑service cloud-based ad-buying platform that enables them to plan, manage, optimize and measure data‑driven digital advertising campaigns. Our platform allows clients to execute integrated campaigns across various advertising channels and formats, including CTV and other video, display, audio and native, on a multitude of devices, including televisions, streaming devices, mobile devices, computers and digital-out-of-home devices.\n•\nWe Are Focused on the Buy Side.\n We focus on buyers since they control the advertising budgets. The supply of digital advertising inventory exceeds demand, and accordingly, we believe it is a buyer’s market. We also believe that by aligning our core offerings with buyers, we are able to avoid conflicts of interest that exist when serving both the buy side and sell side. We provide and are developing additional offerings and features that work with publishers and supply-side partners to help ensure access to quality advertising inventory and to enable improved evaluation of such inventory and better decisioning capabilities for buyers of advertising. This focus allows us to build trust with clients, many of whom leverage their proprietary data on our platform. That trust and ability to use their own data on our platform, without worrying about it being used by other participants, enables our clients and their advertisers to achieve better results. This trust provides us with the benefit of long-term and stable relationships with our clients.\n•\nWe Are an Enabler, Not a Disruptor.\n Through our platform and related offerings, we enable advertisers, agencies and other service providers that participate in the digital advertising ecosystem. Advertisers are able to use our platform directly or through their agencies of choice.\n•\nWe Are Data Driven.\n Our platform was founded on the principle that data-driven decisions will be the future of advertising. We built a data-management platform first, before building our ad-buying technology. While data from third-party data providers improves campaign performance, our clients’ success often relies largely on our ability to ingest proprietary data directly from advertisers and agencies to enable intelligent decisioning that optimizes advertising campaigns. Given our independent buy-side focused approach and our strict protocols governing the ingestion of client first-party data into our data management platform, our clients trust us with their most granular and expressive data. Our technology platform enables effective use of such data, allowing our clients to run precisely targeted advertising campaigns that help maximize their return on advertising investments. Additionally, we are able to better optimize campaigns by using the data streams that we capture across different devices, so that data from one channel can be used to inform another (subject to appropriate consumer choices). The breadth of data that we make available on our data marketplace from numerous data sources across channels gives our clients a holistic view of their target audiences, enabling more effective targeting across different channels. Finally, the depth of data we make available, such as various types of retail data, including in-store purchase data, gives our clients the ability to engage in more precise attribution and closed-loop measurement.\n•\nWe Do Not Arbitrage Advertising Inventory.\n To further align our interests with those of our clients, we do not buy advertising inventory in order to resell it to our clients for a profit. Instead, we provide our clients with a platform that allows them to manage their omnichannel advertising campaigns, on a self-service basis with robust reporting. With our platform, our clients control their campaign spend and can access and choose from many inventory sources. \n6\nTable of Contents\n•\nWe Have Ongoing Relationships with Clients.\n We derive substantially all of our revenue from ongoing MSAs with our clients, rather than episodic insertion orders. We believe this approach strengthens our relationships with our clients and helps us grow their use of our platform over the long term, providing us with a highly scalable business model.\n•\nWe Are a Clear Box, Not a Black Box.\n Our platform is transparent and shows our clients their spend on advertising inventory, value-added services and data; the platform fee; and detailed performance metrics on their advertising campaigns. Our clients directly access and execute campaigns on our platform and control all facets of inventory purchasing decisions. Clients also receive detailed, real-time reporting on all their advertising campaigns. By providing transparent information on our platform, we enable our clients to continually compare results and target their budgets toward the most effective advertising inventory, data providers and channels.\n•\nWe Are an Open Platform.\n Clients can customize and build their own features on top of our platform. For example, clients may use our APIs to design their own user interface, bulk manage advertising campaigns and link other systems, including ad servers or reporting tools. By using our APIs or by working with our engineering team, clients can invest their own resources to build their own proprietary tools for reporting, campaign strategy, custom algorithms, proprietary data use or other use cases. Our open platform approach enables our advertising agency and service provider clients to provide differentiated offerings to their clients, which we believe leads to long-term relationships and increased use of our platform. \nOur Platform\nAt the core of our platform is our bid-factor-based architecture that allows users to define desirable factors and the value associated with those factors. Based on these factors, our platform can compute the value of impressions in real time and bid only for optimal impressions. Because of the granularity of the bid factors, users of our platform can rapidly create billions of different bid permutations with only a few clicks. This expressiveness enables better targeting, pricing and campaign results.\nOur platform is powerful and user friendly:\n•\nEasy to Use, Open and Customizable.\n Our platform includes easy-to-use tools and interfaces that help our users focus on managing the key elements of their campaigns. Our platform also enables clients to integrate custom features and interfaces for their own use through our APIs.\n•\nExpressiveness.\n Our platform allows clients to easily define and manage advertising campaigns with multiple targeting parameters that could result in quadrillions of permutations, which we refer to as expressiveness. We believe that expressiveness provides clients with the ability to target audiences with an extremely high level of precision and thus obtain higher returns on their advertising spend.\n•\nIntegrated, Omnichannel and Cross Device.\n Our platform provides integrated access to a wide range of omnichannel inventory and data sources, as well as third-party services such as ad servers, ad-verification services and survey vendors. Our platform’s integration of these sources and services enables our clients to deploy their budgets through a wide variety of channels, device types and formats, targeted in their desired manner, all through a single platform.\nSome of the key features of our platform are:\n•\nAuto Optimization.\n We provide auto-optimization features that allow buyers to automate their campaigns and support them with computer-generated modeling and decision making. In addition, by giving clients full reporting, budgeting and bidding transparency, clients can take control of targeting variables when desired, and apply algorithmic automation when appropriate.\n•\nAdvanced Reporting and Analytics Tools.\n We provide a comprehensive view of consumers’ interactions with the ads purchased through our platform with robust reporting of performance insights across multiple variables, such as audience characteristics, ad format, site category, website, device, creative type and geography. Better reporting results in better learning, enabling better campaign optimization and outcomes.\n•\nData Management and Measurement Tools.\n Our platform enables clients to optimize campaigns with numerous highly relevant data sets, including from an extensive selection of third-party vendors, in a \n7\nTable of Contents\nseamless and easy manner. We also empower our clients with an extensive set of measurement capabilities, both through a number of proprietary benchmarking tools and indices, and through integrations with a broad selection of third-party measurement partners.\n•\nArtificial Intelligence.\n Koa, our \npredictive algorithmic tool, utilizes artificial intelligence to process complex data sets and make recommendations for campaign optimizations. These recommendations help platform users make data-driven decisions without sacrificing control or transparency and empower users to choose which optimizations make the most sense for their campaigns. Koa’s artificial intelligence capabilities are used across various aspects of the platform, including predictive clearing, ad impression relevance scoring, measurement and forecasting, budget optimization and key performance indicator scoring.\n•\nInformed Media Planning. \nOur platform enables clients to use audience insights and strategic goals to help optimize campaign planning, with the ability\n to generate, analyze and launch data-driven, programmatic media plans. Our tools analyze the actions of existing core audiences with the data we see across the open Internet to deliver fully transparent, performance-focused and ready-to-activate campaigns.\n•\nPrivate Marketplace Support.\n For clients who wish to transact directly with individual publishers, we offer a comprehensive user interface for discovering and transacting via a wide variety of private contracts. Additionally, we offer a solution for advertisers to access publisher inventory via a direct tag in a publisher’s ad server where there is no other programmatic access to such publisher’s inventory.\nOur platform enables advertisers and agencies to:\n•\npurchase digital media programmatically on various media exchanges and sell-side platforms, as well as directly from publishers;\n•\nacquire and use third-party data to optimize and measure digital advertising campaigns;\n•\nintegrate and deploy their proprietary first-party data within our platform to optimize campaign efficacy;\n•\nmonitor and manage ongoing digital advertising campaigns on a real-time basis;\n•\nlink digital campaigns to offline sales results or other business objectives;\n•\naccess other services such as our data management platform and publisher management platform marketplace; and\n•\nuse our user interface and APIs to customize and expand platform functionality.\nOur Technology\nThe core elements of our technology are:\n•\nScalable Architecture.\n Our platform infrastructure is hosted in data centers around the world. Our core bidding architecture is easily adaptable to a variety of inventory formats, allowing our platform to communicate with many different inventory sources.\n•\nPredictive Models.\n We use campaign data captured by our platform to build predictive models around user characteristics, such as demographic, purchase intent or interest data. Data from our platform is continually fed back into these models, which enables them to improve over time as the use of our platform increases.\n•\nPerformance Optimization.\n During campaign execution, our optimization engine continually scores a variety of attributes of each impression, such as website, industry vertical or geography, for their likelihood to achieve campaign performance goals. Our bidding engine then shifts bids and budgets in real time to deliver optimal performance. Additionally, our platform enables clients to set multiple, simultaneous optimization goals for their advertising.\n•\nReal-time Analytics.\n Our platform continuously collects data regarding inventory availability. Real-time campaign delivery and spend totals are used to manage campaign budgets and goal caps, as well as campaign reporting. This data is fed back into our optimization engine to improve campaign performance and into machine-learning models for user demographic predictive modeling.\n8\nTable of Contents\nOur Growth Strategy\nThe key elements of our long-term growth strategy include:\n•\nIncrease Our Share of Existing Clients’ Digital Advertising Spend.\n Many advertisers are moving a greater percentage of their advertising budgets to programmatic channels. We believe that this shift will provide us with the opportunity to capture a larger share of the overall advertising spend by our existing clients. Additionally, we plan to promote additional services, data, and incentive plans to our clients, helping us grow our business.\n•\nGrow Our Client Base.\n We have extensive relationships with many advertising agencies, advertisers and other service providers, and we believe that, given the decentralized nature of the advertising industry, we have the opportunity to expand our relationships with new and existing clients. We expect to continue making investments to grow our sales and client service team to support this strategy.\n•\nExpand Our Omnichannel Capabilities.\n We believe offering clients capabilities across all media channels and devices enables advertisers to manage highly effective omnichannel campaigns, where data from each channel can inform decisions in other channels. We believe these capabilities will continue to further strengthen our relationships with our clients. We intend to continue investing in innovation across all channels, including the integration of new inventory sources within CTV and other video, display, audio and native. \n•\nExtend Our Reach in CTV.\n Television is the largest category of advertising spend, and we believe that the future of television is CTV, the streaming of media and video on demand through subscription and ad-supported streaming services. We plan to continue investing significant resources in technology, sales and support staff related to our CTV growth initiatives.\n•\nEnsure Access to Quality Inventory. \nOur continued success depends on our ability to secure increasing amounts of attractive, high-quality inventory on reasonable terms for our clients. As part of such efforts, we have developed and plan to continue to enhance OpenPath, our offering intended to give clients access to quality inventory through a simplified, direct connection to publishers, and we may develop additional features or offerings to help our clients evaluate the quality and cost of inventory. Because the amount, quality and cost of inventory available to us can change at any time, we intend to continue making investments to maintain and grow our available inventory and ensure its quality.\n•\nFurther Enhance Identity Solutions, Including Unified ID 2.0. \nWe continue to develop and enhance Unified ID 2.0, an open-source identity framework that operates by transforming email addresses or phone numbers into an advertising identifier (a “UID2”) that is designed to not directly identify the individual. Subject to appropriate guardrails, participants in Unified ID 2.0 can then use this UID2 in connection with our platform and other services, including ad buying and reporting. We have worked to cultivate industry-wide support and collaboration for the Unified ID 2.0 approach, and we intend to continue these efforts. EUID, a European-focused version of Unified ID 2.0, was released in a limited beta in 2023.\n•\nContinue to Innovate in Technology, Data and Measurement.\n We intend to continue innovating and improving the technology underlying our platform and enhancing its features and functionalities, including the development of new or improved value-added services or the inclusion of additional data. We view data and measurement as key competitive advantages, and we will continue to invest resources in growing and enhancing our data and measurement offerings.\n•\nExpand Our International Presence.\n Many of our clients serve advertisers on a global basis, and we intend to expand our presence outside of the United States to serve the needs of those advertisers in additional geographies. As we expand relationships with our existing clients, we are investing in select regions in Europe and Asia. In particular, we believe that the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Germany, France, China, Japan, India and Australia may represent substantial growth opportunities, and we are investing in developing our business in those and other markets.\nOur Clients\nOur clients consist of purchasers of programmatic advertising inventory, value-added services and data. Our clients are advertising agencies, advertisers or groups within advertising agencies that have independent relationships with us, manage budgets independently of one another, are based in different jurisdictions and are served by unique Trade Desk teams. Many of these advertising agencies are owned by holding companies, where decision making is decentralized such \n9\nTable of Contents\nthat purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with advertisers are located, at the agency, local branch or division level. \nOur clients typically enter into MSAs with us that give users constant access to our platform. Our MSAs, some of which may include joint business plans and other incentive programs, do not contain any material commitments on behalf of clients to use our platform to purchase ad inventory, value-added services or data. Generally, these MSAs have one-year terms that renew automatically for additional one-year periods, unless earlier terminated, and are terminable at any time upon 60 days’ notice by either party.\nOur clients are loyal, as reflected by our client retention rate of over 95% in each of the last eleven years. In addition, our clients typically grow their use of our platform and related offerings over time.\nIf all of our individual client contractual relationships were aggregated at the holding company level, one holding company would have represented more than 10% of our gross billings in 2024 and 2023. We generally do not have contractual relationships with holding companies; rather, in most cases we enter into separate contracts and billing relationships with various of their individual agencies and account for those agencies as separate clients. \nOur Advertising Inventory and Data Suppliers\nWe believe that we are an important business partner for suppliers of programmatic advertising inventory and data as we represent one of the largest sources of buy-side demand within the digital advertising industry.\nWe obtain digital advertising inventory from over 220 directly integrated ad exchanges, publishers and supply-side platforms, providing us with access to a breadth of programmatic advertising inventory across televisions, streaming devices, mobile devices, computers and digital-out-of-home devices. \nWe believe that our data marketplace represents an important distribution channel for third-party data vendors. As of December 31, 2024, we have integrated our platform with more than 350 third-party data vendors whose products are available for purchase through our platform.\nSales and Marketing\nGiven our self-service business model, we focus on supporting, advising and training our clients to use our platform independently as soon as they are ready to transact. \nOnce a new client has access to our platform, they work closely with our client service teams, which onboard the new client and provide continuous support throughout the early campaigns. Typically, once a client has gained some initial experience, it will move to a fully self-service model and request support as needed.\nTo help train our clients, suppliers and other digital media participants, we have created an e-learning program called The Trade Desk Edge Academy. We believe that this initiative is an important component in our strategy of enabling rapid onboarding to our platform.\nOur marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness for our brand, executing thought-leadership initiatives, supporting our sales team and generating new leads. We seek to accomplish these objectives by presenting at industry conferences, hosting client conferences, publishing white papers and research, engaging in public relations activities, expanding our social media presence and launching advertising campaigns.\nTechnology and Development\nRapid innovation is a core driver of our business success and our corporate culture. We prioritize and align our product roadmap with our clients’ needs, and we aim to refresh our platform weekly. Our development teams are intentionally lean and nimble in nature, providing for transparency and accountability.\nWe expect technology and development expense to increase as we continue to invest in the development of our platform and related offerings to support additional platform features and functionality, increase the number of advertising inventory and data suppliers and support anticipated increases in volume of advertising spend by our clients on our platform. We also intend to invest in technology to further automate our business processes. \n10\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects our highest level of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole.\nOur Competition\nOur industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with other demand-side platform providers, some of which are smaller, privately held companies and others are divisions of large, well-established companies such as Google and Amazon. We believe that we compete primarily based on the performance, capabilities and transparency of our platform as well as our focus on the buy side. We believe we are differentiated from our competitors in the following areas:\n•\nwe are an independent technology company focused on serving advertising agencies, advertisers and others on the buy side of our industry;\n•\nour client relationships are based on MSAs as opposed to campaign-specific insertion orders;\n•\nour platform provides comprehensive access to a wide range of inventory types and third-party data vendors; \n•\nour platform allows clients to build proprietary advantages by integrating custom features and interfaces for their own use through our APIs; and\n•\nour technology provides highly expressive targeting.\nIn addition, we believe new entrants would find it difficult to gain direct access to inventory providers, given their limited scale and the costs that additional integrations impose on inventory providers.\nOur Human Capital\nWe believe our values of vision, agility, grit, openness, generosity and being full hearted are an important component of our success. Behind all our innovations are the talented people around the world who bring them to life. To continue to produce such innovations, we believe it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. We strive to make The Trade Desk a diverse and inclusive workplace, where our people feel they belong, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. To ensure we live our values and our culture stays unique and strong, our board of directors and executive team has put significant focus on our human capital resources.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 3,522 full-time employees in 20 countries. Regionally, North America, Asia Pacific (“APAC”) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) make up approximately 64%, 17% and 19% of our workforce, respectively.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging in which all employees are empowered to bring their whole, authentic selves to work every day. At The Trade Desk, we believe in the people who work for us, and we prioritize diversity and inclusion as part of our investment in our people. Our goal is to create a culture where we value, respect and provide fair treatment and opportunities for all employees. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and we conduct various internal surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, culture, manager performance and inclusivity. Our leaders review the survey feedback, if applicable, and other concerns raised by team members and work with their teams to take action.\nWe demonstrate this commitment through a strategy of education, celebration, donations to the community, diversification of our talent and the creation of forums for internal dialogue and listening. As of December 31, 2024, our global leadership team is 68% male and 32% female. \n11\nTable of Contents\nTalent Development\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and our company culture of ownership. We empower employees to develop their skills and abilities by acting on great ideas regardless of their role or function, which translates into personal investment in building our organization. We work to provide an environment where talented individuals and teams can thrive in fulfilling careers.\nTo set our global team up for success, we define key competencies for roles that are aligned with our values and extend to all levels of leadership regardless of experience and role. We encourage everyone to create individual development plans leveraging competency frameworks tied into their chosen career path, outlining a specific plan and actions to increase proficiency or learn new skills. We seek to provide a wide range of learning and development opportunities in both individual and group settings with formal, social and experiential learning. \nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees and reward their efforts and contributions. We seek fairness in total compensation with reference to external comparisons, internal comparisons and the relationship between management and non-management compensation. \nIn addition to salaries, we provide competitive compensation programs commensurate with our peers and industry. Such compensation and benefit programs may include bonuses, equity awards, 401(k) plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, employee assistance programs and tuition assistance, among many others. Such programs and our overall compensation packages seek to facilitate retention of key personnel.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. We utilize a hybrid work model that includes both in-person work and working from home, which we determined was in the best interests of our employees. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs. \nDevelopment of International Markets\nWe have been increasing our focus on markets outside the United States to serve the global needs of our clients. We believe that the global opportunity for programmatic advertising is significant and will continue to expand as publishers and advertisers outside the United States seek to adopt the benefits that programmatic advertising provides. To capitalize on this opportunity, we intend to continue investing in our presence internationally. Our growth and the success of our initiatives in newer markets will depend on the continued adoption of our platform by our existing clients, as well as new clients, in these markets. Information about our geographic gross billings is set forth in \nNote 12—Segment and Geographic Information\n of “\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nThe protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. We have a small number of patents; however, historically, we have not patented our proprietary technology in order to keep our technology architecture, trade secrets and engineering roadmap private. Our patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, and our issued patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us.\nCollection and Use of Data; Privacy and Data Protection Legislation and Regulation\nTo power our platform, we and our clients currently use pseudonymous data about Internet and mobile app users to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns in a variety of ways, including delivering advertisements to end users based on information such as their geographic locations, the type of device they are using, their interests as inferred from their web browsing or app usage activity or their relationships with our clients. Such data is passed to us from third parties, \n12\nTable of Contents\nincluding original equipment manufacturers, application providers, data providers and publishers, as well as our advertiser clients. We do not use this data to discover the identity of individuals, and we currently contractually prohibit clients, data providers and inventory suppliers from importing data that directly identifies individuals onto our ad buying platform. In connection with certain offerings, including Unified ID 2.0 and EUID, we do allow users of those services to disclose some directly identifying information, such as phone number and email address, to us for purposes of transforming that information into pseudonymous identifiers to use on our platform. We also take in email addresses and phone numbers to operationalize the opt-out portal we offer in connection with Unified ID 2.0 and EUID, as well as in connection with a single-sign on tool we offer to publishers, known as OpenPass.\nOur ability, and the ability of other advertising technology companies, to collect, augment, analyze, use and share data relies upon the ability to uniquely identify devices across websites and applications, and to collect data about user interactions with those devices for purposes such as serving relevant ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads. The processes used to identify devices and similar and associated technologies are governed by U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and are dependent upon their implementation within the industry ecosystem. Such laws, regulations, and industry standards change frequently, including those relating to the level of consumer notice, consent and/or choice required when a company uses data for certain purposes, including targeted advertising, or employs cookies or other electronic tools to collect data about interactions with users online. \nIn the United States, both federal and state legislation govern activities such as the collection and use of personal data, and data privacy in the advertising technology industry has frequently been subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), U.S. Congress, and individual states. Relying on Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits companies from engaging in “unfair” or “deceptive” trade practices, the FTC actively pursues alleged violations of representations concerning privacy protections and acts that allegedly violate individuals’ privacy interests. In addition, increasing consumer concern over data privacy in recent years has led to a myriad of enacted and proposed legislation and regulation both at the federal and state levels, some of which has affected and will continue to affect our operations and those of clients, inventory sources and other industry partners. \nMany states have adopted omnibus consumer privacy laws, a number of which are already enforceable, while others will take effect over the coming years. Other states are considering similar legislation. These state laws define “personal information” broadly enough to include many online identifiers provided by individuals’ devices, applications, and protocols (such as IP addresses, mobile application identifiers and unique cookie identifiers), individuals’ location data and hashed versions of email addresses and phone numbers. In many respects, these state laws focus significantly on advertising activities, mandating that businesses that engage in certain advertising uses of consumer personal information to offer and honor an opt-out of such activities, including, in some states, through browser or device-based preference signals. (Terminology varies slightly among some of the state laws, referring to such practices as “processing for targeted advertising” or “sales” or “sharing” of personal information, but the opt-out requirement exists under each state’s law.) These state privacy laws also provide consumers other rights, such as to access, correct or delete their personal information (subject to certain limitations), opt out of certain processing of their personal information and impose special rules on the collection of data from minors, as well as transparency and data governance obligations. Importantly, as a consequence of the obligations under these laws, the availability of data within our platform, our related offerings and the advertising ecosystem more broadly may decline, potentially making our platform and services less valuable to our clients.\nThe requirement under certain states’ laws to honor users’ requests to opt out of certain disclosures and uses of data for advertising purposes through preference signals, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) or similar signals, reflects a broader attention that privacy advocates, the media and some government regulators, have devoted to digital advertising in recent years. If the use of the GPC or similar technical signals is adopted by many Internet users, is imposed by additional states or by federal or foreign legislation, or is agreed upon by standard setting groups, we may have to change our business practices, our clients may reduce their use of our platform and services, and our business could be harmed. \nAs our business is global, our activities are also subject to foreign legislation and regulation. In Europe, including the U.K. and the European Union (the “EU”) and the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and the countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, separate laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) govern the processing of personal data, and these laws and regulations continue to impact us. The General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK GDPR”) (the EU GDPR and UK GDPR are hereinafter referred to collectively as the GDPR), which apply to us, define “personal data” broadly. Together with related laws, such as the ePrivacy Directive, we and our clients and inventory partners face enhanced data protection obligations, both as controllers of such data and as service providers processing the \n13\nTable of Contents\ndata. These laws also provide certain rights, such as access and deletion, to the individuals about whom the personal data relates, and require consent for certain activities. IAB Europe previously collaborated with the digital advertising industry to create a user-facing framework (the Transparency and Control Framework, or “TCF”) for establishing and managing legal bases under the GDPR and other U.K. and EU privacy laws including the ePrivacy Directive (discussed below). Although the TCF is actively in use, its viability as a compliance mechanism is under review by the European authorities and we cannot predict its effectiveness over the long term (as further detailed in the Risk Factors section). Maintaining compliance with the requirements of European privacy laws and regulations, including monitoring and adjusting to rulings and interpretations that affect our approach to compliance, requires significant time, resources and expense, and may lead to significant changes in our business operations, as will the effort to monitor whether additional changes to our business practices and our backend configuration are needed, all of which may increase operating costs, or limit our ability to operate or expand our business.\nAdditionally, in the EU, the EU Directive 2002/58/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), commonly referred to as the ePrivacy or Cookie Directive, directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user’s computer, such as through a cookie and other similar technologies, is allowed only if the Internet user has been informed about such access, and provided consent. A replacement for the ePrivacy Directive is currently under discussion by EU member states to complement and bring electronic communication services in line with the EU GDPR and force a harmonized approach across EU member states. Although it remains under debate, the proposed ePrivacy Regulation may further raise the bar for the use of cookies, and the fines and penalties for breach may be significant. We cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.\nTo address the transfer of personal data from the EEA, Switzerland and U.K. to the United States, we rely upon, and are currently certified under, the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (“DPF”) and the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. The European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the DPF in July 2023, replacing the prior Privacy Shield Framework, as an adequate mechanism by which EU companies may pass personal data to the United States However, the DPF is already subject to legal challenge in Europe. Whether and how other European mechanisms for adequate data transfer, such as standard contractual clauses, can be used to transfer personal data to the United States remains in question. If all or some jurisdictions within the EU or the U.K. determine that the latest standard contractual clauses cannot be used to transfer personal data to the United States and if the DPF is ultimately struck down in a manner similar to the Privacy Shield Framework, then, we could be left with no reasonable option for the lawful cross-border transfer of personal data. In such circumstance, continuing to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States could lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity. Such consequences could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business, such as by requiring us to establish systems to maintain certain data in the EU, which may involve substantial expense and cause us to divert resources from other aspects of our operations, all of which may harm our business. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are considering cross-border or data residency restrictions, which could reduce the amount of data we can collect or process and, as a result, significantly impact our business.\nIn addition, the online advertising ecosystem is subject to best practices and self-regulatory standards, such as those promulgated by the Network Advertising Initiative, or NAI, the Digital Advertising Alliance, or DAA, and their international counterparts.\nAvailable Information\nWe file Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and related amendments, exhibits and other information with the SEC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and the “Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOverview\n \nWe offer a self-service, cloud-based ad-buying platform that empowers our clients to plan, manage, optimize and measure more expressive data-driven digital advertising campaigns. Our platform allows clients to execute integrated campaigns across ad formats and channels, including CTV and other video, display, audio, and native, on a multitude of devices, such as televisions, streaming devices, mobile devices, computers and digital-out-of-home devices. Our platform’s integrations with major inventory, publisher and data partners provide ad buyers reach and decisioning capabilities, and our enterprise APIs enable our clients to customize and expand platform functionality.\nOur clients are advertising agencies, advertisers and other service providers for agencies or advertisers, with whom we enter into ongoing MSAs. We generate revenue by charging our clients a platform fee generally based on a percentage of our clients’ total spend on our platform and from providing value-added services and data to support their advertising campaigns.\n44\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Summary\nHighlights\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n(in millions, except percentages)\nRevenue\n$\n2,445 \n$\n1,946 \n$\n499 \n26 \n%\nNet income\n$\n393 \n$\n179 \n$\n214 \n120 \n%\nGross spend \n(1)\n$\n12,041 \n$\n9,611 \n$\n2,430 \n25 \n%\n________\n(1)\nFor internal management purposes, we utilize gross spend as a metric to assess our market share and scale, plan for optimal levels of support for our clients and measure our growth from existing clients. Gross spend measures the amount of a client’s spend on our platform for advertising inventory, value-added services and data; plus the platform fee, which is generally based on a percentage of a client’s total spend on our platform. We expect our take rate (revenue as a percentage of gross spend) to fluctuate due to the types of services rendered and client-selected features purchased through our platform and certain volume discounts. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate gross spend or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nTrends, Opportunities and Challenges\nThe growing digitization of media and fragmentation of audiences has increased the complexity of advertising, and thereby increased the need for automation in ad buying, which we provide on our platform. In order to grow, we will need to continue to develop our platform’s programmatic capabilities and expand our advertising inventory, value-added services and data to support our clients’ advertising campaigns. We believe that key opportunities include our ongoing global expansion, continuing development of our omnichannel ad inventory (including in channels such as CTV and other video, mobile, audio and others), adoption and utilization of retail data and continuing development and adoption of the data usage, measurement and targeting capabilities provided by our platform.\nWe believe that growth of the programmatic advertising market is important for our ability to grow our business. Adoption of programmatic advertising by advertisers allows us to acquire new clients and grow revenue from existing clients. Although our clients include some of the largest advertising agencies and advertisers in the world, we believe there is significant room for us to expand further within these clients and gain a larger amount of their advertising spend through our platform. We also believe that the industry trends noted above will lead to advertisers adopting programmatic advertising through platforms such as ours.\nSimilarly, the adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers allows us to expand the volume and type of advertising inventory we present to our clients. For example, we have expanded our CTV, audio and other advertising offerings through our integrations with supply-side partners and publishers.\nWe invest for long-term growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we invest in platform operations and technology and development to enhance our platform, including programmatic buying of CTV ad inventory, and hosting capabilities. We also anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase to acquire new clients and reinforce our relationships with existing clients. In addition, we expect to continue making investments in our infrastructure, including our information technology, financial and administrative systems and controls to support our growing operations.\nWe believe the markets outside of the United States, and in particular across Europe and Asia in markets such as the U.K, Germany, France, China, Japan, India and Australia, offer opportunities for growth. However, such markets may also pose challenges related to compliance with local laws and regulations, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, uncertainty related to trade relations and a variety of additional risks. We intend to make additional investments in sales and marketing and product development to expand in international markets where we are making significant investments in our platform and growing our team.\nWe believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may negatively impact profitability in the near term.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOur business model has allowed us to grow significantly, and we believe that our operating leverage enables us to support future long-term growth profitably. \nMacroeconomic Uncertainty\nChanges in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, inflation and geopolitical developments have resulted, and may continue to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services in various industries, including those provided by our clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities for an unknown period of time until economic activity normalizes. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, we are unable to predict the size and duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations. The extent of the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, and the duration and extent of geopolitical and global economic disruption and their respective impacts on our clients, partners, industry and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be accurately predicted. See “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of macroeconomic uncertainty on our business.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nGrowth in and Retention of Client Spend\nOur recent growth has been driven by expanding our share of spend by our existing clients and adding new clients. Our clients include some of the largest advertising agencies and advertisers in the world, and we believe there is significant room for us to expand further within these clients. As a result, future revenue growth depends upon our ability to retain our existing clients and to gain a larger amount of their spend through our platform in a highly competitive advertising market.\nIn order to analyze gross spend contributions and growth from existing clients, we measure annual gross spend for the set of clients, or cohort, that commenced spending on our platform in a specific year relative to subsequent periods. The gross spend from each of our cohorts has increased over subsequent periods. However, over time, we will likely lose clients from each cohort, clients may spend less on our platform and the growth rate of gross spend may change. Any such change could have a significant negative impact on gross spend and operating results.\nAbility to Expand our Omnichannel Reach, Including CTV, and Innovate across our Platform\nWe enable the purchase of advertising inventory in a wide variety of ad formats and channels, including CTV and other video, display, audio, and native, on a multitude of devices, such televisions, streaming devices, mobile devices, computers and digital-out-of-home devices. Our future growth will depend on our ability to maintain and grow the inventory and spend across these channels, in addition to continued growth in CTV. Our future growth will also depend on our ability to continue innovating and improving the technology underlying our platform and related offerings and enhancing their functionality, including the development of new or improved value-added services or the inclusion of additional data. We believe that our ability to integrate and offer CTV and other advertising inventory for purchase through our platform, our ability to continuously improve the features and functionality of our platform and related offerings and, in particular, our ability to manage the increased costs that will accompany these efforts, will impact the future growth of our business.\nGrowth of the Programmatic Advertising Market\nOur operating results and prospects will be impacted by the overall adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers, as well as advertisers and the agencies and service providers that represent them. Programmatic advertising has grown rapidly in recent years, and any acceleration or slowing of this growth may affect our operating and financial performance. In addition, even if the programmatic advertising market continues to grow at its current rate, our ability to position ourselves within the market will impact the future growth of our business. Further, our ability to effectively manage our investments in infrastructure and headcount in response to this potential growth will impact our future profitability.\nDevelopment of International Markets\nWe have been increasing our focus on markets outside the United States to serve the global needs of our clients. As the middle class grows abroad, we believe that the global opportunity for programmatic advertising is significant and \n46\nTable of Contents\nshould continue to expand as publishers and advertisers outside the United States seek to adopt the benefits that programmatic advertising provides. To capitalize on this opportunity, we intend to continue investing in our presence internationally. Our growth and the success of our initiatives in newer markets will depend on the continued adoption of our platform by our existing clients, as well as new clients, in these markets. Information about geographic concentrations of our business is set forth in\n Note 12—Segment and Geographic Information\n.\nSeasonality\nIn the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects our highest level of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nWe have one primary business activity and one operating segment.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from clients who enter into agreements with us to use our platform to purchase advertising inventory, value-added services and data. We charge our clients for total spend on our platform, which includes spend and fees on advertising inventory, value-added services and data to support those purchases, in addition to the platform fee that is generally based on a percentage of our clients’ total spend on the platform. Generally, we report revenue on a net basis, which represents gross billings net of amounts we pay suppliers for the cost of advertising inventory, supplier-provided components of value-added services and data (collectively, “Supplier Components”). \nAccounts receivable is recorded at the amount of gross billings to clients, net of allowances, for the amounts we are responsible to collect; and our accounts payable are recorded at the amount payable to suppliers. Accordingly, both accounts receivable and accounts payable appear large in relation to revenue reported on a net basis.\nRevenue as a percentage of gross spend may fluctuate due to the types of services rendered and client-selected features purchased through our platform and certain volume discounts. We expect that our revenue as a percentage of gross spend will fluctuate in the future, especially as we introduce new and enhanced platform features on our platform that are adopted by our clients, expand our omnichannel capabilities, extend our reach to more CTV and other inventory and add additional clients whose businesses may have different underlying business models.\nRefer to \n“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition”\n below for a description of our revenue recognition policies.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into the following four categories and allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent, office support and occupancy charges based on headcount for these categories:\nPlatform Operations.\n Platform operations expense consists of expenses related to hosting our platform, which includes “internet traffic” associated with the viewing of available impressions or queries per second (“QPS”), purchasing data used to inform and improve the platform and providing support to our clients. Platform operations expense includes hosting costs, personnel costs, data-related costs and amortization of capitalized software costs for platform development. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs and travel for personnel who support our platform and provide our clients with platform support. We capitalize certain costs associated with the development of our platform, which are amortized in platform operations expense over their estimated useful lives. \nWe expect platform operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to experience increased volumes of QPS through our platform, invest in our hosting capabilities and hire additional personnel to support our clients.\nSales and Marketing.\n Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefits costs, commission costs and travel, for our sales and marketing \n47\nTable of Contents\npersonnel. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, marketing events, advertising and promotional and other marketing activities. Commissions costs are expensed as incurred.\nOur sales organization focuses on marketing our platform to increase its adoption by existing and new clients. We are also focused on expanding our international business by growing our sales teams in countries in which we currently operate, as well as establishing a presence in additional countries. As a result, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on revenue levels and the timing of our investments in our sales and marketing functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over periods and are impacted by the revenue seasonality in our industry and business.\nTechnology and Development.\n Technology and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefits costs and travel as well as third-party consultant costs associated with the ongoing development of our platform and related offerings as well as integrations with our advertising inventory and data suppliers. Technology and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with software development that qualifies for capitalization. We record capitalized software development costs related to platform development in other assets, non-current in our consolidated balance sheets, and we amortize those costs in platform operations expense.\nWe believe that continued investment in our platform is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and long-term growth. Therefore, we expect technology and development expense to increase as we continue to invest in the development of our platform to support additional platform features and functionality, increase the number of advertising inventory and data  suppliers and support the anticipated increase in volume of advertising spend on our platform. Our development efforts also include additional platform functionality to support our international expansion. We also intend to invest in technology to further automate our business processes.\nGeneral and Administrative.\n General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefits costs and travel associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees, local business taxes and fees and credit loss expense. General and administrative expenses also include stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Option.\nWe expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure to support growth. Excluding the impact of the CEO Performance Option, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods.\nOther Income, Net\nInterest Expense.\n Interest expense is mainly related to our debt, which carries a variable interest rate.\nInterest Income.\n Interest income is mainly related to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which carry variable interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Loss (Gain), Net.\n Foreign currency exchange loss (gain), net consists primarily of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions net of gains and losses on foreign currency forwards. We do not designate foreign currency forwards as hedges for accounting purposes. We have foreign currency exposure related to our accounts receivable and, to a much lesser extent, accounts payable that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, Indonesian Rupiah, Hong Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. Our income tax provision may be significantly affected by changes to our estimates for tax in jurisdictions in which we operate, and other estimates utilized in determining the global effective tax rate. Actual results may also differ from our estimates based on changes in economic conditions. Such changes could have a substantial impact on the income tax provision. We evaluate the judgments surrounding our estimates and make adjustments, as appropriate, each reporting period. Our income tax provision may also be affected by the timing of vesting and/or exercise of our stock-based awards. The extent of the impact may be subject to volatility resulting from changes in our stock price and volume of transactions by employees.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOur effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to research and development tax credits, tax benefits associated with employee exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock, nondeductible stock-based compensation and foreign tax rate differences and state taxes.\nRealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on the generation of future taxable income. In considering the need for a valuation allowance, we consider our historical, as well as future, projected taxable income along with other objectively verifiable evidence, both positive and negative. Objectively verifiable evidence includes our realization of tax attributes, assessment of tax credits and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during the year.\n We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.K. net deferred tax assets, based on the history of cumulative losses and the conclusion that future taxable profit may not be available for the utilization of the deferred tax assets for U.K. income tax purposes. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the near term, until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of these U.K. deferred tax assets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and may result in a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.\nRefer to \nNote 11—Income Taxes \nfor additional information.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nThe following discusses the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion of the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with SEC on February 15, 2024. References to “Notes” are notes to our consolidated financial statements in “Item 8.

The increase in hosting costs was primarily attributable to support costs related to the increased use of our platform by our clients, increased use of features by our technical teams in support of our platform and investment in new data centers to support the continued growth of our platform. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to the increase in stock-based compensation driven by new equity awards and the impact of the rising stock price on our 2024 employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”); an increase in platform support by engineers; headcount growth; an increase in taxes on equity awards; and an increase in travel.\nWe expect platform operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to experience increased volumes of media impressions through our platform, invest in our hosting capabilities and hire additional personnel to support our growth.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased\n by $99 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe increase was primarily due to increases of $84 million in personnel costs, which included a $23 million increase in stock-based compensation, $10 million in allocated facilities costs and $5 million in marketing costs. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth to support our sales efforts and to continue to develop and maintain relationships with our clients; an increase in incentive compensation driven by gross spend growth; and an increase in travel. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily driven by new equity awards and the impact of the rising stock price on the ESPP. The increase in allocated facilities costs was primarily driven by new leases for additional office space to support our future growth as well as office support expenses. The increase in marketing costs was primarily due to an increase in marketing campaigns, events, sponsorships and client engagement. \nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, as we focus on increasing the adoption of our platform with existing and new clients and expanding our international business.\nTechnology and Development\n \nTechnology and development expense increased\n by $52 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe increase was primarily due to increases of $43 million in personnel costs, which included an $18 million increase in stock-based compensation, and $7 million in allocated facilities costs. The increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to headcount growth to maintain and support further development of our platform, an increase in taxes on equity awards and an increase in travel. The increase in stock-based compensation was due to a $32 million increase primarily driven by new equity awards and the impact of the rising stock price on the ESPP; this was partially offset by the cancellation of unvested equity awards for our former Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) in 2023, which resulted in the recognition of $14 million in incremental stock-based compensation in the year ended December 31, 2023, that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to \nNote 10—Stock-Based Compensation\n for further detail. The increase in allocated facilities costs was primarily driven by new leases for additional office space to support our future growth as well as office support expenses.\nWe expect technology and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform and related offerings to support additional platform features and functionality, increase the number of advertising inventory and data suppliers and support the anticipated increase in volume of advertising spend by our clients on our platform. We also intend to invest in technology to further automate our business processes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased\n by $16 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe increase was primarily due to increases of $33 million in personnel \n50\nTable of Contents\ncosts and $28 million in administrative costs, partially offset by a \n$46 million\n decrease in stock-based compensation. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to increased headcount to support our growth, an increase in travel and an increase in taxes on equity awards. The increase in administrative costs was primarily driven by increases in external professional fees and local business taxes. The decrease in stock-based compensation was primarily driven by a $70 million decrease from the CEO Performance Option driven by the graded-vesting attribution method, under which more expense is recognized earlier in the option’s life, partially offset by a $24 million increase primarily driven by new equity awards as well as the impact of the rising stock price on the ESPP.\nExcluding the impact of the CEO Performance Option, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase primarily due to continued investment in corporate infrastructure to support growth. For additional information regarding the CEO Performance Option, refer to \nNote 10— Stock-Based Compensation\n.\nOther Income, Net\nTotal other income, net increased\n by $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \nThe increase was primarily due to higher interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments driven by higher amounts invested as well as rising portfolio interest rates.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe difference between the effective tax rate in 2024 of 23% and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% was primarily due to nondeductible stock-based compensation and the impact of taxes in foreign and state jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards and research and development tax credits. For 2024, the provision for income taxes included $73 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards and $29 million of research and development tax credits.\nThe difference between the effective tax rate in 2023 of 33% and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% was primarily due to nondeductible stock-based compensation and the impact of taxes in foreign and state jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards and research and development tax credits. For 2023, the provision from income taxes included $53 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards and $23 million of research and development tax credits.\nRefer to \nNote 11—Income Taxes \nfor additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had working capital of $2,463 million, which included $1,369 million in cash and cash equivalents, $88 million of which was held by our international subsidiaries, and $552 million in short-term investments in marketable securities. Additionally, we had $442 million available under our Amended Credit Facility (refer to the “Credit Facility” section below). For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated $739 million in cash flows from operating activities.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and our undrawn available balance under our Amended Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and investments we make from time to time for at least the next 12 months. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our share repurchase program. Further, we have a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC (the “Shelf Registration”), which permits us to issue equity securities and equity-linked securities from time to time, subject to certain limitations. The Shelf Registration is intended to provide us with additional flexibility to access capital markets for general corporate purposes, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in \n“Item 1A. Risk Factors”\n \nin Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n.\nIn the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt-financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors.\n51\nTable of Contents\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if our operating performance during the next 12 months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected. We are closely monitoring the effect that current macroeconomic factors may have on our working capital requirements. \nCredit Facility\nOn June 15, 2021, we and a syndicate of banks, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, entered into\n a Loan and Security Agreement \n(the “Credit Facility”). The \nCredit Facility \nconsists of a $450 million revolving loan facility, with a $20 million sublimit for swingline borrowings and a $15 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Under certain circumstances, we have the right to increase the Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $300 million.\nOn December 17, 2021, we amended the Credit Facility to expand the process for issuing letters of credit and the related invoicing, particularly with respect to letters of credit not denominated in U.S. Dollars. On February 9, 2023, we further amended the Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”) to transition from a variable interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate to a variable interest rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”).\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have an outstanding debt balance under the Amended Credit Facility. Availability under the Amended Credit Facility was $442 million as of December 31, 2024, which is net of outstanding letters of credit of $8 million.\n \nThe Amended Credit Facility matures, and all outstanding amounts become due and payable, on June 15, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nFor additional information regarding the Amended \nCredit Facility\n, refer to \nNote 7—Debt\n.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2023, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program to repurchase our Class A common stock. The share repurchase program, which has no expiration date, is designed to help offset the impact of future share dilution from employee stock issuances. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases determined at our discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases are structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of our board of directors.\nAs of December 31, 2023, $53 million remained available and authorized for repurchases. In February 2024, an additional $647 million was authorized under this program, bringing the total amount available for future repurchases back to $700 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 2.5 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate repurchase amount of $236 million. The repurchase amounts included in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity included immaterial amounts related to the 1% excise tax on share repurchases, net of share issuances, as a result of the IRA. As of December 31, 2024, $464 million remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2025, we repurchased $28 million of our Class A common stock and an additional $564 million was authorized under this program, bringing the total amount for future repurchases to $1 billion.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n739,456 \n$\n598,322 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(157,513)\n$\n(107,593)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(107,609)\n$\n(626,106)\n52\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by growth in our operations, increases or decreases in collections from our clients and related payments to our suppliers for Supplier Components. We typically pay suppliers in advance of collections from our clients. Our collection and payment cycles can vary from period to period. In addition, we expect seasonality to impact cash flows from operating activities on a sequential quarterly basis during the year.\nIn 2024, cash provided by operating activities of $739 million resulted primarily from net income adjusted for noncash items of $949 million and a net decrease from our operating assets and liabilities of $209 million. The net decrease was primarily due to a $474 million increase in accounts receivable, a $42 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $39 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a $299 million increase in accounts payable and a $47 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from the growth of our business and the timing of cash receipts from clients. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due primarily to rent payments. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to the prepayment of certain travel costs, office lease deposits and software, networking and infrastructure costs to support our platform. The increase in accounts payable was due to the growth of our business and the timing of payments to suppliers for Supplier Components. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in income tax liability driven by the current income tax provision net of tax payments; an increase in various accrued personnel-related costs primarily driven by headcount growth, growth in our business and the timing of accruals and payments; and an increase in the liability related to the ESPP for employee contributions toward the upcoming purchase of shares.\nIn 2023, cash provided by operating activities of $598 million resulted primarily from net income adjusted for noncash items of $721 million and a net decrease from our operating assets and liabilities of $123 million. The net decrease was primarily due to a $554 million increase in accounts receivable, a $53 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $27 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a $475 million increase in accounts payable and a $36 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from the growth of our business and the timing of cash receipts from clients. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due primarily to rent payments. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to the prepayment of personnel travel costs and certain software, networking and infrastructure costs to support our platform. The increase in accounts payable was due to the growth of our business and the timing of payments to suppliers for Supplier Components. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payment of accrued payroll and incentive compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in the income tax liability driven by tax payments net of the current income tax provision.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities consist of investing in short-term marketable securities, capital expenditures for property and equipment for the expansion of facilities to support our hosting capabilities and growing headcount as well as capital expenditures to develop our software in support of enhancing our platform. As our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures to increase, and our other investment activity may increase. \nIn 2024, we used $158 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of $98 million to purchase property and equipment, $50 million of net purchases of short-term investments and $9 million of investments in capitalized software.\nIn 2023, we used $108 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of $53 million of net purchases of short-term investments, $47 million to purchase property and equipment and $8 million of investments in capitalized software.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of our Class A common stock, proceeds from our stock-based award plans and taxes paid to net settle restricted stock awards.\nIn 2024, we used $108 million of cash in financing activities, consisting of $235 million of cash paid for repurchases of Class A common stock and $139 million of taxes paid for restricted stock award settlements, partially offset by $216 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $50 million of proceeds from the ESPP.\nIn 2023, we used $626 million of cash in financing activities, consisting of $647 million of cash paid for repurchases of Class A common stock and $79 million of taxes paid for restricted stock award settlements, partially offset by $61 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $38 million of proceeds from the ESPP.\n53\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2024 other than the indemnification agreements described below.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nOur principal commitments consist of non-cancelable operating leases for our various office and hosting facilities, and other contractual commitments consisting of obligations primarily to our hosting services, hardware providers and providers of software as a service. In certain cases, the terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis.\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period\n2025\n2026 and Thereafter\nTotal\nOperating lease commitments\n$\n46,378 \n$\n615,906 \n$\n662,284 \nOther contractual commitments\n165,268 \n147,802 \n313,070 \nTotal\n$\n211,646 \n$\n763,708 \n$\n975,354 \nAs of December 31, 2024, our total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $107 million before netting with deferred tax assets for tax credit carryforwards and is considered a long-term obligation. Due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements in which we may agree to indemnify clients, suppliers, vendors, lessors, business partners, lenders, stockholders and other parties with respect to certain matters, including losses resulting from claims of intellectual property infringement, damages to property or persons, business losses or other liabilities. Generally, these indemnity and defense obligations relate to our own business operations, obligations and acts or omissions. However, under some circumstances, we agree to indemnify and defend contract counterparties against losses resulting from their own business operations, obligations and acts or omissions, or the business operations, obligations and acts or omissions of third parties. These indemnity provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements in which they appear. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors, executive officers and other officers that will require us to indemnify them against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. In the ordinary course of business, demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements, but we are not aware of any claims that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, no material amounts have been recorded at December 31, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, including the determination of revenue recognition as net versus gross in our revenue arrangements, stock-based compensation expense and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. \n54\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from clients who enter into agreements with us to use our platform to purchase advertising inventory, value-added services and data. We charge our clients for total spend on our platform, which includes spend and fees on advertising inventory, value-added services and data to support those purchases, in addition to the platform fee that is generally based on a percentage of our clients’ total spend.\nGenerally, we report revenue net of amounts we pay suppliers for Supplier Components. Judgment is required to determine whether we are the principal and report revenue on a gross basis for Supplier Components or the agent and report revenue on a net basis for the amount of fees charged to the client. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified service before it is transferred to the client, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk and discretion in establishing price. \nFrom time to time, we may enter into agreements with data suppliers where the purchased data is used to inform and improve our platform, generally at no additional charge to our clients outside of our standard fees. Costs associated with this data (“data-related costs”) are recorded in platform operations expense.\nFor additional information regarding revenue and the assumptions used for determining our revenue recognition refer to \nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock awards and units (collectively, “restricted stock”), and awards granted under the ESPP is measured and recognized in our consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. In October 2021, we granted the CEO Performance Option under the 2016 Incentive Award Plan. The fair values of our ESPP and stock option awards are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, except for the CEO Performance Option that was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock is calculated using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. \nStock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years. Stock-based compensation for the CEO Performance Option, which was granted in 2021, is recognized on a graded-vesting basis over a derived service period of approximately five years but may be accelerated if the vesting criteria is met prior to the estimated performance period. Stock-based compensation expense for ESPP awards is recognized on a graded-vesting attribution basis over the requisite service period of each award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock options and ESPP awards requires judgment, and the models described above require the input of subjective assumptions such as the estimate of the volatility of the underlying common stock and the derived service period of the CEO Performance Option. For stock options granted in 2024, we determined the expected term of our stock options using historical option exercise behavior after obtaining sufficient historical exercise data. Prior to 2024, we applied the simplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award. This change did not materially impact stock-based compensation expense. \nOn May 28, 2024, our stockholders approved the ESPP, an amendment and restatement of the original 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2016 ESPP”). The changes from the 2016 ESPP to the ESPP included removing the ten-year plan expiration date and changing the offering period commencement dates on future offering periods from May 16th and November 16th to May 15th and November 15th, respectively. Existing offering periods under the 2016 ESPP continue unchanged under the ESPP, and the provision for annual increases in shares authorized for grant under the ESPP will still end on and include January 1, 2026. These changes did not materially impact our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. We do not currently expect the new or modified provisions of the ESPP to materially impact our financial statements in future periods.\nFor additional information regarding stock-based compensation and the assumptions used for determining the fair value of stock options and ESPP awards, refer to \nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nand\n Note 10—Stock-Based Compensation.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provision may be significantly affected by changes to our estimates for tax in jurisdictions in which we operate, changes to the evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets and changes to other estimates utilized in determining the global effective tax rate. Actual results may also differ from our estimate based on changes in economic conditions. Regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets, and the determination of their valuation allowance, actual taxable income could differ from projected taxable income in future periods. Such changes could have a substantial impact on the income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. We evaluate the judgments surrounding our estimates and make adjustments, as appropriate, each reporting period.\nFor additional information regarding income taxes and the assumptions used for determining our income tax provision, as well as our related deferred income tax assets and liabilities, refer to \nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nand\n Note 11—Income Taxes\n.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n of our consolidated financial statements.",
