Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our current and targeted customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. NetApp uses a multichannel distribution strategy. We sell our products, solutions and services to end-user business customers and service providers through a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners, including the leading cloud providers. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation, creating market awareness, communicating customer advantages and generating demand for our sales force and channel partners.\nOur diversified customer base spans industry segments and vertical markets such as energy, financial services, government, technology, internet, life sciences, healthcare services, manufacturing, media, entertainment, animation, video postproduction and telecommunications. NetApp focuses primarily on the enterprise storage and data management, cloud storage and cloud operations markets. We design our products to meet the evolving requirements of a hybrid, multicloud world, driven by digital transformation and cloud initiatives.\nOur partnerships with the industry’s leading cloud, infrastructure, consulting, application, and reseller partners are created with one goal in mind: the success of our customers. Global enterprises, local businesses, and government agencies look to NetApp and our ecosystem of partners to help maximize the business value of their IT and cloud investments.\nWe work with a wide range of partners for our customers, including technology partners, value-added resellers, system integrators, OEMs, service providers and distributors. During fiscal 2025, sales through our indirect channels represented 78% of our net revenues. Our global partner ecosystem is critical to NetApp’s growth and success. We are continually strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new ones to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers.\nAs of April 25, 2025, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 5,100 managers, sales representatives and technical support personnel. We have offices in approximately 26 countries. Sales to customers Arrow Electronics, Inc. and TD Synnex Corporation accounted for 21% and 24% of our net revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2025. Information about sales to and accounts receivables from our major customers, segment disclosures, foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in Note 15 – Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced a sequential decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year, as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter, and because sales to European customers are typically weaker during the summer months. We derive a substantial amount of our revenue in any given quarter from customer orders booked in the same quarter. Customer orders and revenues typically follow intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the end of the quarter. If recurring services and cloud revenue continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues, historical seasonal patterns may become less pronounced.\nBacklog\nWe manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand. Orders are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. A substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty. In certain circumstances, purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements. Our business is characterized by seasonal and intra-quarter variability in demand, as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules. Accordingly, backlog at any given time may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue.\nManufacturing and Supply Chain\nWe have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in Fremont, California; San Jose, California; Guadalajara, Mexico; Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands; Helmond, The Netherlands; Tiszaujvaros, Hungary; Taoyuan City, Taiwan; and Singapore. These operations include materials procurement, commodity management, component engineering, test engineering, manufacturing engineering, product assembly, product assurance, quality control, final test, and global logistics. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials, as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems. We strive to have multiple suppliers qualified to provide critical components where possible and have our products manufactured in a number of locations to mitigate our supply chain risk. Our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers, maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating the implementation of joint quality programs. We use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration. This manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion.\nWe are certified to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certification standards. We have been Tier 2 certified under the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) program since January 2015.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team delivers innovation to help customers create an evolved cloud experience. Our R&D structure allows us to align and accelerate the execution of our strategies and roadmaps across product groups. We leverage our talent and shared IP for cloud- and hybrid-cloud solutions to remain agile to changing market conditions. Our R&D priorities are defined by how we can help customers realize operational simplicity, cyber resilience and security, AI innovation, infrastructure savings and agility, and sustainability. We design our products and services from the ground up with cloud connectivity in mind, including our capabilities for cyber resiliency, tiering, disaster recovery, replication, bursting, and migration.\nWe conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world. Total research and development expenses were $1,012 million in fiscal 2025, $1,029 million in fiscal 2024 and $956 million in fiscal 2023. These costs consist primarily of personnel and related expenses incurred to conduct product development activities. Although we develop many of our products internally, we also acquire technology through business combinations or through third party licensing when appropriate. We believe that technical leadership is essential to our success, and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development.\nCompetition\nWe operate in an industry with rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and related service offerings. Cloud, digital transformation, and AI initiatives are driving customer and solution requirements changes.\nWe compete with many companies in the storage and data management markets. Our hybrid cloud solutions primarily compete with legacy IT and storage vendors. Some offer a broad spectrum of products, solutions and services and others offer a more limited set of storage and data-management products, solutions or services. In the emerging AI market, we encounter both our traditional competitive set, as well as newer entrants, focused primarily on the AI model training space. Additionally, public cloud providers offer customers storage as an operating expense which competes with more traditional storage offerings that customers acquire\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthrough capital expenditures. We both partner with and compete against cloud providers with our public cloud software and services. Legacy vendors are not often encountered as competitors in the cloud storage services market.\nWe compete with many companies in the cloud operations marketplace, including new companies (startups) and larger software companies who target developers, and operations engineering (DevOps). Some companies have single point solutions that compete with one of our services and others are building platforms. Additionally, public cloud providers offer similar services on their own cloud.\nWe face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded- and generic-product competitors.\n \nOur current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third-parties, including some of our partners. New competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and further increase competitive pressures.\nWe consider our hardware, software innovation, cloud integration, and technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation. We believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide. We strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product, service, and support offerings, which enables us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before, during and after their purchases.\nProprietary Rights\nWe generally rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology, products and services. While our intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe that our business is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, copyright, license or other individual intellectual property right. We have been granted, or own by assignment\n,\n well over two thousand U.S. patents, hundreds of pending U.S. patent applications, and many corresponding patents and patent applications in other countries. From time to time, we may make certain intellectual property available under an open source license. Our primary trademarks are NetApp and the NetApp design logo, which are registered trademarks in the U.S. and in many other countries.  In addition, we have trademarks and trademark registrations in the U.S. and other countries covering our various product or service names.\nWe generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, resellers, distributors, customers, and suppliers. In addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive certain rights to the intellectual property of others. We expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure additional licensing arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support continued development and sales of our products and services. Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments; offsetting considerations, if any; and the degree of use of the licensed technology.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights, and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nEnvironmental Disclosure\nWe believe that our commitment to helping our customers and partners succeed and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live supports our efforts to deliver value to our stockholders. We are committed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; the efficient use of resources; and reducing, relative to the growth of the Company, the environmental impacts from our operations, products, and services, as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas.\n \nWe voluntarily measure, monitor, and publicly report our scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 (partial) greenhouse gas emissions and water impacts. We seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings, labs, and data centers; and we have increased our use of renewable energy, especially at our facilities in Bangalore, India (95% of the total energy consumed is renewable); Cork, Ireland (100% of electricity consumed is from renewable energy) and Wichita, Kansas (100% of the electricity consumed is produced by renewable wind energy).\nAt the global, regional and state levels, various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate or report on the effects of climate change. Environmental laws are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. However, it is difficult to anticipate future regulations pertaining to environmental matters and to estimate their impacts on our operations. Additionally, we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfacilities, business, and supply chain might face as a consequence of natural disasters, earthquakes, floods, droughts, and other such occurrences or severe weather/climate-related phenomena.\nWe are subject to international, federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. Various international, federal, state, and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products. Failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs, subject us to business interruptions or cause customers to cease purchasing from us. We strive to comply with all applicable environmental laws. All of our products meet the applicable requirements of the following European Union (EU) directives: Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH); Energy Related Products (ErP); and Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS). We also comply with the China RoHS directive. We have a global product take-back program and an e-waste scheme to comply with the EU directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations in India, Singapore and California.\nWe have maintained an environmental management system since December 2004 that provides the framework for setting, monitoring, and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives. As part of ISO 14001 requirements, we set local environmental performance goals, such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site, that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy. We also conduct periodic reviews and are subject to third-party audits of our operations, and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws, not only in our operations but also for our products.\nHuman Capital\nWe take pride in, and believe our success depends on, attracting and retaining leading talent in the industry based on a culture-fit approach. From our inception, NetApp has worked to build a model company and has embraced a culture of openness and trust. Our employees are supported and encouraged to be innovative, and we communicate openly and transparently so that employees can focus on critical and impactful work that ties directly to our business strategy. We continue to invest in our global workforce to support inclusion and belonging and our employees’ well-being and development.\n \nBelonging\nWe believe inclusion and belonging lead to more innovation, better access to talent and improved business outcomes. Our strategies are intended to promote a team-based culture, inclusiveness, and to achieve sustained business results.\n \nBenefits, Wellbeing and Engagement\nOur healthcare options offer competitive, comprehensive coverage for our employees and their families, including:\n \n•\nNational medical plans;\n•\nRegional medical plans;\n•\nExpert advice from world-renowned doctors through our medical second opinion program;\n•\nNational dental plans;\n•\nNational vision plans; and\n•\nA robust wellness program.\nInsurance and income protection\n. We provide life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability insurance programs. For additional peace of mind, we also offer supplemental insurance for our employees and their dependents.\nFinancial and savings programs.\n We offer flexible spending accounts, an employee stock purchase plan and competitive retirement plans, including options to maximize retirement savings.\n \nFlexible Work.\n We offer a flexible hybrid work program that allows employees, in consultation with their managers and teams, flexibility around where, when and how work is performed to deliver business outcomes, understanding that certain roles may be tied to specific locations or require an in-office presence due to business needs and job responsibilities, and to collaborate and connect most effectively. We are leaning into digital-first workflows, tools, and resources and programs to continuously promote flexibility, while enabling us to be productive, wherever we are. We also believe in the value of people being together, building relationships, fostering trust, collaboration and innovation. We have evolved into a hybrid model, in which employees who are assigned to an office can divide their work between the office and other locations about half the time. We continue to pilot, test and iterate our approach to support new ways of working and evolving the employee experience.\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEmployee Wellbeing.\n We provide a wide range of wellbeing programs and tools to ensure employees and their families have the resources they need when they need them. We offer emotional wellbeing resources and programs such as back-up child and elder care, student debt repayment, educational assistance, and legal services for employees and their dependents. NetApp also offers a variety of time-off programs to help support our employees who need time-off. Employees also have access to discounts and fitness centers.\nEngagement. \nWe help employees grow, develop and succeed at NetApp by encouraging an open and interactive culture, where individual needs are recognized and met, and Company goals are supported. For employees, growth goals are tied to corporate objectives and key results to ensure that employees are progressing and are supported by management teams.  Managers are encouraged to set aside time at least each quarter to conduct a two-way conversation with each team member to offer feedback, guidance and support on goals, priorities and career development. The Company also conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like cross-functional collaboration, manager performance and inclusivity and create action plans to address concerns and amplify opportunities.\n \nGiving Back. \nThe NetApp Cares programs support our employees' efforts to make a positive difference in our communities. In fiscal 2025, NetApp employees donated over 20,900 hours to serve their communities and make an impact around the world. The NetApp Cares programs encourage employees to volunteer through individual, team or company efforts.\nBoard Oversight of Human Capital Management\nOur Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing the Company's human capital management strategy and programs.

These risks can and will change in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nGlobal economic and geopolitical conditions have adversely affected and may in the future continue to adversely affect our industry, business operations, and financial performance, including our revenue growth, profitability, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs a global company, our business is influenced by worldwide economic and market conditions, including, among others, inflation, slower growth, economic downturn or recession, changes in fiscal and monetary policies, higher interest and tax rates, economic uncertainty, political instability, regional conflicts, military warfare, extreme weather events and effects from climate change, natural disasters and pandemics, supply chain interruptions and shortages, changes in laws, reduced consumer confidence and spending, international trade protection measures and disputes (including economic and trade barriers, tariffs, sanctions and export controls), and the threat and potential of retaliatory trade control policies (including retaliatory tariffs). These factors, as well as the fear or anticipation of such conditions, may influence decisions and actions by our key stakeholders and the market generally, and can lead to increased volatility in the IT industry, making it difficult to predict future demand for our products and services. They can also negatively impact the availability of supplies and limit access to capital for our suppliers, customers and partners.\n \nAny of these factors above, as well as other adverse macroeconomic conditions can significantly reduce demand for our products and negatively affect our operating results due to customer concerns about declining demand for their products, reduced asset values, fluctuating energy costs, geopolitical issues, the cost and availability of credit, and the stability of financial institutions, markets, businesses, and governments. These conditions may be widespread, and their resolution could be uncertain. If we are not able to efficiently and effectively resolve such issues in a timely manner, or if our chosen strategies are not successful, then our business, operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. Consequently, these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by technological trends in our market or our inability to keep pace with rapid industry, technological, and market changes.\nThe growth in our industry and the markets we compete in is driven by the increasing demand for data, which in turn drives the need for storage and data management solutions. However, our markets could face challenges due to technology transitions, increased storage efficiency, competitive pricing dynamics, changing consumption models, and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on the storage and data management markets and regulation thereof is still unfolding and could evolve unpredictably.\n \nAs customers undergo their information technology (IT) transformations, leveraging modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments, they seek simpler solutions and new consumption models. This shift is directing spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash storage, hybrid cloud, cloud storage, and IT as a service. The future impact of these trends on both short- and long-term demand for our products is uncertain, and we may struggle to meet customer demand with the expected level of quality and support for new products or services.\nOur business may suffer if we fail to keep pace with rapid industry, technological, or market changes, or if our products and services are not well-received in the marketplace. These factors, along with other considerations discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, could lead to a decline in customer demand for our products and services, resulting in decreased revenue on a year-over-year basis, as seen in fiscal 2017, 2020, and 2024. If the overall growth rate of industry declines, if specific markets we compete in experience reduced growth, if storage consumption models change, if our new and existing products and services do not gain customer acceptance, or if we do not adapt our sales programs to market changes, our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n \nThe global nature of our business exposes us to risks that could materially harm our operations, revenues, and financial results.\nA significant portion of our operations and revenues are derived from outside of the U.S., and most of our products are sourced and manufactured outside of the U.S. We also have research and development, sales, and service centers internationally. Consequently, our international operations and future financial results could be adversely affected by various economic, business, regulatory, social and political factors in foreign countries. These factors include government controls, local political or economic conditions such as recessions, economic downturns, inflation and political uncertainty, economic sanctions, trade protections and regulations, export and import requirements (including but not limited to government and regulatory authorizations), tariffs, investment restrictions, tax\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npolicies, treaties or laws, local labor conditions, transportation costs, government spending patterns, geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, acts of terrorism, international conflicts,  natural disasters, and adverse public health developments.\nChanges in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we source and/or manufacture products, including the impact on our suppliers and contract manufacturers who may look to pass through additional costs imposed on them, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. The U.S. government has recently enacted changes to U.S. trade policy and has signaled plans for possible additional changes. For example, the U.S. government has imposed sweeping tariffs on certain products and countries and has signaled that further tariffs may be imposed in the future. The U.S. government's tariffs policy remains fluid, with tariffs on certain countries delayed or reduced in scope, and additional tariffs likely to be forthcoming on other countries or specified products. Additional tariffs and restrictive policies, particularly with respect to the tariffs on Mexico, could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. The exact magnitude of any potential impact remains uncertain given possible further changes in tariffs and increased tensions with U.S. trading partners targeted by tariffs or other restrictive trade policies. Our risk exposure may increase further if any countries levy retaliatory tariffs, taxes, or other trade restrictions or penalties against the United States or U.S. companies.\nAdditionally, ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and recent investment restrictions, such as the U.S. Outbound Investment Security Program, could impact our business and operating results. Any increase in tensions between China and Taiwan, including threats of military actions or escalation of military activities, could adversely affect our or our contract manufacturers’ ability to source key supply chain components included in our products. As a result of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, numerous countries and organizations have imposed sanctions and export controls, while businesses, including the Company, have limited or suspended Russian operations. Russia has likewise imposed currency restrictions and regulations and may further take retaliatory trade or other actions, including the nationalization of foreign businesses. These actions could impact our supply chain, pricing, business and operating results and expose us to cyberattacks. In addition, due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products, including antitrust and anti-competition laws, and regulations related to data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation, or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than U.S. laws. Such factors have had or could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n \nWe face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. We utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies may not be successful, and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, our foreign currency exposure on assets, liabilities, and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies.\n \nMoreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is a common business practice to engage in activities that are prohibited by NetApp's internal policies and procedures, or laws and regulations applicable to us. There can be no assurance that all our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will comply with these policies, procedures, laws and/or regulations. Any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe dynamic markets in which we operate and our sales and distribution structure make it challenging to forecast revenues, and any disruption could harm our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe participate in dynamic markets and employ diverse business and sales models, which complicate revenue forecasting. We sell to a wide range of customers across various industries and geographies, both directly and through multiple channels, each with different sales cycles. Most of our sales are made and/or fulfilled indirectly through channel partners, including value-added resellers, systems integrators, distributors, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and strategic business partners, including public cloud providers. This structure makes it particularly difficult to predict future revenue, especially within any specific fiscal quarter or year.\n \nOur relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are crucial to our success. The loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a particular region, or the failure of our channel or strategic partners, including public cloud providers, to promote our products could negatively impact our operating results. Qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires significant time and resource investment before achieving acceptable productivity levels.\n \nIf we fail to maintain strong relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners, including public cloud providers, if our partners seek to renegotiate or terminate existing contracts or agreements, or if their financial condition, business, or\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncustomer relationships weaken, if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, or if we cease to do business with them for these or other reasons, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n \nOur business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected if we are unable to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones, or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services.\nOur future growth relies on the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services. The complexity of storage and data management software, subsystems and appliances, as well as the challenges in estimating the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, pose significant technical and quality control risks for these new products and services. If we encounter technological challenges, customer reluctance, or other obstacles that prevent us from developing, introducing and gaining market acceptance for new products and services, or if we fail to provide the expected level of product and support quality, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Introducing new products and features exposes us to additional financial and operational risks. These include the ability to forecast customer preferences and demand, managing production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services and avoid excessive inventories of older products and components, manage the transition from older products and solutions, and handle the impact of customer demand for new offerings versus those being replaced.\n \nAs customers transition from older products to newer ones, delays or decisions to postpone the transition could lead to non-renewal of new offerings, impacting our ability to manage and forecast customer churn and expansion rates. Additionally, uncertainties related to the price-performance of new products compared to competitors, competitors’ responses to our new products, extended evaluation periods by customers, and our partners’ investment in selling our new products add to the inherent risks. If we do not manage these risks effectively, our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could face significant adverse impacts. Furthermore, entering new or emerging markets will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and expose us to additional competition. We may struggle to provide competitive products, services and support for these market opportunities.\n \nOur gross margins may fluctuate.\nOur gross margins are influenced by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic volatility, competitive pricing, component and product design costs, inflation, foreign exchange currency fluctuations, and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product sales, software support, hardware support, and other services offerings. Factors such as increased component and labor costs, pricing and discounting pressures, changes in component costs and product prices, or shifts in revenue mix and volume from different offerings could negatively impact our revenues, gross margins or earnings.\n \nAdditionally, our gross margins are affected by the cost of any substandard materials and our sales and distribution activities, including pricing actions, rebates, sales initiatives, discount levels, and the timing of service contract renewals. Third-party component costs make up a significant portion of our product costs. We may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components, including NAND, become limited or component prices rise. Such limitations could increase our product costs.\n \nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, negative impacts on our gross margins due to rising component costs, logistics costs, tariffs and other trade barriers, and inflationary pressures. An increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings. Failure to sustain or improve our gross margins may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nIssues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI), including GenAI, could lead to legal or regulatory action, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm our business.\nAs a technology company at the forefront of AI innovation, our business faces potential risks associated with the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape for AI. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly enacting new laws and guidelines to address the ethical, privacy, and security implications of AI technologies. Non-compliance, even if inadvertent or without our knowledge, with these emerging regulations could result in legal and financial penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. Additionally, the diverse and sometimes conflicting nature of international AI regulations may pose challenges in maintaining consistent compliance across different jurisdictions. The complexity and novelty of these laws may also require investments in compliance infrastructure, including enhanced data governance frameworks, algorithmic transparency, and bias mitigation strategies.\nWe are increasingly building and/or leveraging AI technology in certain products, services, and business operations, and our research and development in this area is ongoing. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and potential unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers’ adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed, and AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving. We face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies.\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving ethical and legal issues presented by the use of AI before they arise. AI-related issues, deficiencies and/or failures could result in (i) legal or regulatory action, including to enforce new legislation regulating AI in various jurisdictions where we operate, and the application of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws; (ii) damage to our reputation; (iii) time-consuming and costly litigation, including related to intellectual property; (iv) inability to protect our intellectual property; (v) disclosure of our confidential information or (vi) other material harm to our business. If regulation significantly delays or impedes the adoption of AI, we may not be able to meet our development goals or our sales forecasts.\nIncreasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur markets are highly competitive, fragmented, and characterized by rapidly changing technology. We face competition from many companies, including established public companies, newer public companies with a strong focus on flash storage, and new market entrants targeting opportunities in GenAI and application data management for Kubernetes. Some competitors offer a broad range of IT products and services (full-stack vendors), while others offer a more limited set.\n \nTechnology trends, such as GenAI, hosted or public cloud storage, software as a service (SaaS), IT as a service, and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements. Cloud service providers offer storage on demand without requiring capital expenditure, which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has altered the competitive landscape. Competitors may develop new technologies, products, or services ahead of us or establish new business models, more flexible purchase models, or disruptive technologies. By extending our offerings in flash, cloud storage, converged infrastructure, and block storage, and GenAI, we are entering new segments and facing competition from both traditional competitors and emerging competitors. The long-term potential and competitiveness of emerging vendors remains uncertain.\n \nNew competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and quickly gain significant market share or buying power. Changes in customer requirements or increased industry consolidation could result in stronger competitors better able to compete. Additionally, current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including some of our partners or suppliers. For additional information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Part I, Item 1 - Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTransition to consumption-based business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business, potentially harming our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe offer customers a variety of consumption models, including cloud-based storage services and storage as a service (STaaS) delivered on-premises. As these business models continue to evolve, we may face challenges in competing effectively, generating significant revenues, or maintaining the profitability of our consumption-based offerings. Additionally, the growing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may reduce overall demand for our traditional on-premises offerings sold through a capital expenditure (capex) model, which could negatively impact our revenues and cash flow, at least in the short term. Failure to successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate customer needs could lead to a decline in our revenues and our profitability could decline.\nAs customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases, we will encounter differences in the timing of revenue recognition compared to our traditional purchase arrangements. Revenue from traditional purchases is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery, whereas revenue from consumption model offerings is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. We incur certain expenses related to the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings before we can recognize the associated revenues.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel to advance our corporate strategy and maintain key aspects of our corporate culture. As our future success relies on enhancing and introducing new products and features, we particularly need to attract and retain qualified engineers and technical talent, especially in emerging technology areas like AI and machine learning. To increase revenues, we must also increase the productivity of our sales force, which may require an increase in support infrastructure and personnel, to achieve adequate customer coverage.\nCompetition for qualified employees, particularly in the technology industry, is intense. We have periodically reduced our workforce, including restructuring plans announced in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2025, respectively. These actions may make it more challenging to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to hire and retain skilled management and personnel, particularly engineers, salespeople, and key executive management, could disrupt our development efforts, sales results, business relationships, and our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, adversely affecting our operating results, financial conditions and cash flows.\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMany of our employees participate in our hybrid work program and work remotely on a full- or part-time basis.  Changes to our office environments, including the adoption of new work models and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees, and may create challenges in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, adversely affecting our business operations and financial performance.\n \nAdditionally, many of our employees are foreign nationals relying on visas and entry permits to work legally in the U.S. and other countries, and may be dependent on licenses to work with controlled technology. Restrictions or difficulties in obtaining H-1B, L-1 and other business visas, as well as licenses to work with controlled technologies, along with compliance with new immigration and labor laws and unintended impacts from changes in immigration policy or in the enforcement of existing immigration laws and policies, could lead to unexpected labor costs and hinder our ability to retain and attract skilled professionals, negatively impacting our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nEquity grants are a crucial part of our compensation programs, supporting talent attraction and engagement and aligning employee interests with stockholders. A competitive broad-based equity compensation program is essential to compete for talent in both the hardware and software industries, where competitors offer significant equity compensation. Reducing, modifying, or eliminating our equity programs, or failing to grant equity competitively, may hinder our ability to attract and retain critical employees.\n \nFurthermore, the structure of our sales, cash, and equity incentive compensation plans may increase the risk of losing employees at certain times, such as after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards.\nOur acquisitions or divestitures may not achieve the expected benefits and could increase our liabilities, disrupt our existing business, and harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs part of our strategy, we may seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products and services, expand our market reach, or enhance our technical capabilities. The benefits we have received, and expect to receive, from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems, procedures and organizational structure. We may also divest businesses, product lines, or divisions that no longer align with our current offerings. For example, we sold our FinOps business to Flexera in fiscal 2025. Realizing the benefits we would expect to receive from a divestiture would depend on our ability to manage the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, in addition to other risks.\n \nAny inaccuracy in our assumptions or failures to identify and mitigate liabilities or risks associated with an acquisition or divestiture – such as differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data privacy protection controls or contractual limitations of liability – could reduce or eliminate the expected acquisition or divestiture benefits. If we fail to make acquisitions or divestitures on favorable terms, integrate or divest the subject business or assets as planned, or retain or separate key employees, our costs could increase, our operations could be disrupted, and we could face additional liabilities, investigations and litigation. This could harm our strategy, business, and operating results. Additionally, the failure to achieve expected benefits from acquisitions or divestitures may result in impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe often incur expenses before receiving related benefits, and it may be difficult to reduce expenses quickly if demand declines.\nWe base our expense levels partly on future revenue expectations, and a significant portion of our expenses are fixed. Reducing these fixed costs quickly can be challenging, and if our revenue falls below expectations, our operating results could be adversely impacted. During periods of uneven growth or decline, we may incur costs before realizing the anticipated benefits, which could also harm our operating results.\n \nWe have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in engineering, sales, service and support, marketing, and other functions to support and grow our business. The costs associated with these investments are likely to be recognized earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits, such as revenue growth. Additionally, the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nInitiatives to improve our cost structure, business processes, and systems may not achieve the expected benefits and could negatively impact our reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe continuously strive to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient, including by relocating our business activities from higher-cost to lower-cost locations, outsourcing certain business processes and functions, and implementing changes to our business information systems. These efforts require significant investment of financial and human resources and substantial changes to our current operations. For example, in fiscal 2025, we continued our implementation of certain new business information systems, including a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to enhance and standardize our processes, improve oversight, and better serve our customers. However, any disruption during this transition could impact our ability to send and track invoices, process\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nvendor payments, pay employees, fulfill contractual obligations, report financial results, maintain effective internal controls, or operate our business effectively.\n \nWe may also encounter difficulties in implementing new business information systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems and software. These difficulties could lead to significant expenses or losses due to unexpected additional costs, disruption in business operations, loss of sales or profits, or delays in processing and reporting key financial information. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as we move operations to lower-cost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes, we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations, increasing our dependence upon third-party systems and processes. If we fail to move operations, outsource processes, or implement new information in compliance with local laws and maintain adequate standards, controls and procedures, the quality of our products and services may suffer, and we may face increased litigation risk. These issues could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n \nIf we do not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives, our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be harmed.\nWe are exposed to credit risks, fluctuations in the market value of our investment portfolio, and potential adverse effects on our cash and cash equivalents if the financial institutions holding them fail.\n \nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. The credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by factors such as volatile macroeconomic conditions, liquidity issues, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors. Consequently, the value and liquidity of our investments and their returns may fluctuate significantly. Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, rising interest rates, international trade protection measures and disputes (including economic and trade barriers, tariffs, sanctions and export controls), or other circumstances could lead to an economic slowdown or global recession, potentially causing failures of counterparties, including financial institutions, governments, and insurers. This could materially decrease the value of our investment portfolio and substantially reduce our investment returns.\n \nWe regularly maintain cash balances at large third-party financial institutions that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit of $250,000 and similar regulatory insurance limits outside the United States. If a depository institution where we maintain deposits fails or faces adverse financial or credit markets conditions, we may not be able to recover all of our deposits, which adversely impacts our operating liquidity and financial performance.\n \nAdditionally, if our customers or partners experience liquidity issues due to financial institution defaults or non-performance where they hold cash assets, their ability to pay us may be impaired. This could materially affect our results of operations, including the collection of accounts receivable and cash flows.\nOur initiatives and disclosures related to sustainability and corporate responsibility matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\n \nWe have publicly announced, and may continue to establish and announce, initiatives regarding sustainability and corporate responsibility matters, as well as other related matters in our Impact Report, on our website and elsewhere. These statements, which are included in our Impact Report, on our website, in our SEC filings, and elsewhere, reflect our current plans and aspirations but are not guarantees of achievement. Implementing these initiatives and goals can be challenging and costly, and our current plans and aspirations may not all succeed or be achieved in the way and on the timelines we expect or at all. While these initiatives and goals are not a critical part of our business operations and may not significantly impact our financial performance directly, they are an important part of our business ethos and corporate culture that we believe is valued and appreciated by our investors and key stakeholders.\n \nThere is growing attention from governments, investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders on sustainability and corporate responsibility matters, and laws and regulations regarding disclosure, reporting and diligence requirements continue to evolve. We may face scrutiny from stakeholders regarding the scope or nature of our sustainability and corporate responsibility initiatives or any changes to these initiatives. In addition, state attorneys general and other governmental authorities may take action against certain sustainability and corporate responsibility policies or practices, and we may become subject to restrictions on sustainability and corporate responsibility initiatives. Incomplete or inaccurate sustainability and corporate responsibility-related data, failure to achieve sustainability and corporate responsibility goals, or government enforcement actions or litigation relating to sustainability and corporate responsibility initiatives could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain employees, our attractiveness as an investment or business partner, and ultimately our business, financial performance, and growth.\nRisks Related to Our Customers and Sales\nA portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors.\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA significant portion of our net revenues rely on sales to a limited number of customers and distributors. We typically do not enter into binding long-term purchase commitments with our customers, resellers, and distributors, meaning there is no guarantee that we will continue to receive large, recurring orders from them. For instance, our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases, and our customers, resellers, and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time. The loss, cancellation, or delay of purchases has previously impacted our revenues and could again in the future.\n \nAny deterioration in the financial stability of our customers, resellers, and distributors, or their ability to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products, could significantly adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. If any of our key customers, resellers, or distributors changes its pricing practices, reduces the size or frequency of its orders, or stops purchasing our products altogether, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, major customers may seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us, which could negatively impact our business, cash flow, and operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed.\nOur growth strategy relies on developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and co-market them. Many of our strategic partners are industry leaders that provide us with expanded access to market segments where we do not directly participate. Strategic partnerships with public cloud providers and other cloud service vendors are particularly critical to the success of our cloud-based business.\nHowever, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues, and may be terminated on short notice. Some of our partners also collaborate with our competitors, which can increase the availability of competing solutions and hinder our ability to grow these relationships. Additionally, some partners, especially large and diversified technology companies, including major cloud providers, are also our competitors, complicating our relationships.\nIf we are unable to establish new or maintain current partnerships, if our strategic partners prioritize their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry, if our strategic partners seek to renegotiate or terminate our agreements, or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us, we could experience lower-than-expected revenues, delays in product development, and other adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and periodically restructure our business, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nTo successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market, we need effective planning, forecasting, and management processes that allow us to scale and adjust our business in response to changing market opportunities and conditions.\nIn fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, we reorganized our sales resources, including changes and additions to our sales leadership team, to gain operational efficiencies and better align our resources with customer and market opportunities. However, such reorganization and ongoing adjustments to our go-to-market model could disrupt our sales cycles in the short- or long-term, may not yield the desired efficiencies and benefits, and could harm our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe have undertaken, and may in the future undertake, initiatives that include reorganizing our workforce, restructuring, discontinuing certain products, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, reducing facilities, or a combination of these actions, which could result in restructuring charges. Rapid changes in the size, alignment, or organization of our workforce, including our business unit structure, structure of our sales team, and sales account coverage, could impair our ability to develop, sell and deliver products and services as planned, or hinder our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives. Charges associated with these activities could harm our operating results.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives depends on many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to uncertainties. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nReduced U.S. government demand could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe U.S. government is an important customer for us, but its demand is uncertain due to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints. Uncertainty related to the U.S. government budget and debt levels, changes to governmental agency structure, compliance with new initiatives and executive orders, and reductions in force have increased demand uncertainty for our products. Changes in administration may also lead to programs and initiatives moving in or out of favor, which may lead to varied perception of our company in the U.S. government market and may negatively impact our sales to the U.S. government. Additionally, the U.S. government, like other customers, may evaluate competing products and delay purchases during technology transitions in the storage\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nindustry. If the U.S. government or its agencies reduce or shift their IT spending patterns, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected.\nSelling our products to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, subjects us to specific regulatory and contractual requirements, which may change or increase at short notice. Some of these requirements may extend past the specific nature and products of the arrangement and impact our broader corporate policies, initiatives and employee resources. Failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could lead to investigations, fines, and other penalties (including the loss of such government contracts), harming our operating results and financial condition. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has previously pursued claims and settlements with IT vendors, including us and our competitors and channel partners, under the False Claims Act and other statutes related to violations of regulatory and contractual requirements, which may include such areas as pricing and discount practices, cybersecurity, or procurement integrity. These actions, in addition to potential fines and other penalties as well as potential government audits and investigations, could also result in suspension or disbarment from future government contracts. Additionally, government certification requirements may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications (or are able to make the required certifications to the government). We could also be harmed by claims of non-compliance with these requirements by us or our channel partners. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. In response to evolving and increasing security threats, the U.S. government has imposed additional requirements on IT vendors, including us. These requirements range from software development security (e.g., the Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (EO 14028), issued in May 2021, to require attestation to minimum requirements for our software development framework), to supply chain security (e.g., Section 5949 of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) prohibits us from including in our products or using in our corporate environment certain semiconductor products and services), to cybersecurity (e.g., the U.S. Department of Defense’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program). Failure to meet these requirements as they apply to us and our products may result in delays or inability to execute contracts with customers, particularly with government entities.\nIf we do not achieve forecasted sales orders in any quarter, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. These orders typically follow intra-quarter seasonality patterns, with a significant portion occurring toward the end of the quarter. If we fail to achieve the forecasted level, timing, and mix of orders in line with our quarterly targets and historical patterns, or if we experience cancellations of significant orders, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to the credit and non-payment risk of our customers, resellers and distributors, especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days. During periods of economic uncertainty, when access to liquidity may be limited, we may experience increased losses as more customers become unable to pay their obligations to us, either in full or in part. Additionally, some customers have entered into recourse and non-recourse financing leasing arrangements using third-party leasing companies. Under recourse leases, which typically last three years or less, we remain liable for the unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies if the end-user customer defaults.\n \nOur exposure to credit risks from our customers increases during economic uncertainty or volatility. This risk may further increase if our customers, their customers, or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Services\nAny disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe do not manufacture certain components used in our products. We rely on third parties to manufacture critical components and handle associated logistics. Our lack of direct control over these elements, combined with the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers, creates significant risks for us, including:\n•\nLimited number of suppliers for certain components; \n•\nNo guarantees of supply and limited ability to control the quality, quantity and cost of our products or of their components; \n•\nPotential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates; \n•\nLimited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations; \n•\nLabor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own; \n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nGeopolitical disputes, acts of terrorism, cyber attacks and hacktivism disrupting our supply chain; \n•\nImpacts on our supply chain from adverse public health developments; \n•\nBusiness, regulatory compliance, legal compliance, litigation, trade controls and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship components in the quantities, quality and manner as required; and \n•\nDisruptions due to floods, earthquakes, storms, fires and other natural disasters, especially those caused by climate change, and particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources.\nThese risks have subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to supply constraints, price increases, and minimum purchase requirements, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers, introduce and increase volumes of new products, or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers. During these times, our ability to manage relationships among ourselves, our manufacturing partners, and our component suppliers, becomes critical. New manufacturers, products, components, or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers. Any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality, quantity or delivery requirements in a cost-effective manner will harm our business, including customer relationships and as a result could harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, disruption to our manufacturing operations, or those of our contract manufacturers, could significantly impact our ability to supply our customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on the Company.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components used in assembling our products, including some single-source suppliers. This reliance has subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to price rigidity, periodic supply constraints, and challenges in producing our products with the required quality and quantities. Consolidation among suppliers, particularly within the semiconductor and storage media industries, has led to price volatility and supply constraints. When industry supply is constrained or the supply chain is disrupted, our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors, who depend on many of the same suppliers as we do. As a result, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIf a material cybersecurity or other security breach impacts our services, systems, supply chain, or end-user customer systems, or if stored data is improperly accessed, our business could suffer significant harm.\n \nWe store and transmit, and sell products and services that store and transmit, personal, sensitive and proprietary data related to our products, our employees, customers, clients, partners (including third-party vendors such as data centers and providers of SaaS, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth), and their respective customers. This data includes intellectual property, records, and personal information. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure, products, and services remain secure and are perceived as secure by customers, clients, and partners.\n There are numerous and evolving cybersecurity and privacy risks, including criminal hacking (eCrime), state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, hacktivism, insider threats, inadvertent disclosure, ransomware attacks, social-engineering, exploitation of unpatched or unmanaged vulnerabilities, cyber-attacks to the Company’s service providers, suppliers or vendors, technological vulnerabilities, or destruction or other misuse of data that could harm the Company, operations or our competitive position. In some cases, these types of attacks have been successful. Increasing use of AI in techniques employed by threat actors will continue to increase the risk of successful attacks, while also providing opportunities for improved attack detection and prevention capabilities. Our information systems and data have been specifically targeted by various threat actors, including nation-state affiliated threat actors, and we expect that our information systems and data will continue to be targeted in the future. Cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches have in the past and could in the future result in: (1) unauthorized access to, or loss or unauthorized use, alteration, or disclosure of, personal, sensitive and/or proprietary data; (2) litigation, indemnity obligations, government investigations and proceedings, regulatory fines and penalties, and other possible liabilities; (3) revenue loss; (4) negative publicity and damage to our reputation; and (5) disruptions to our internal and external operations.\n \nThese outcomes could damage our reputation, harm our business, and lead to significant liabilities. Additionally, a cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information has in the past and could in the future result in remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, significant fines, and/or lost revenues.\nOur clients and their customers use our platforms to transmit and store sensitive data. We do not generally have the ability to review the information or content they upload and store, nor do we control the substance of this information or content. If our employees, clients, partners, or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of sensitive information, or our supply-chain cybersecurity is compromised and our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nerror, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities.\nSecurity industry experts and U.S. government officials continue to emphasize risks to our industry. Cyber-attacks and security breaches continue to increase, and of particular concern are supply-chain attacks against software development and breaches of technology service providers. We anticipate that cyberattacks will continue to increase in the future given cyber warfare has become a consistent lever within geopolitical conflicts and increasingly leverages hacktivism. We cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems. We also may face delays in our ability to identify or otherwise respond to any cybersecurity incident or any other breach. Future cyber-attacks or incidents could persist undetected in our environments for a period of time. Additionally, we use third-party service providers to provide some services to us that involve the storage or transmission of data, such as SaaS, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth, and they face various cybersecurity threats and also may suffer cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches. While we conduct diligence on these third parties, our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners’ supply chains have not been or will not be compromised. Many jurisdictions require companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity. The risk of reputational harm may be magnified by the rapid dissemination of information online. Any security incident, loss of data, or other security breach, whether actual or perceived, or whether impacting us or our third-party service providers, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their SaaS subscriptions, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThere can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Our existing general liability insurance coverage, cybersecurity insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf a data center or other third-party who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data, such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products.\nOur clients, including data centers, SaaS providers, cloud computing services and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. These clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in actual or perceived security breaches may result in such actual or perceived breaches being attributed to us.\n \nA failure to meet our customers’ and partners’ expectations regarding security and confidentiality, due to disruptions in services provided by third-party vendors or the loss or alteration of data stored by such vendors, could cause financial or reputational harm to our business. This harm could occur if the disruption or data loss is caused by, or perceived to be caused by, defects in our products. The risk of reputational harm may be magnified by the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, social media, and other online communication forums and services. This could affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business.\nAdditionally, our operations and select cloud services rely on third-party cloud providers. Interruptions due to technical failures such as hardware or software issues or connectivity problems, security incidents, compliance changes, operational challenges and natural disasters could reduce revenue due to the cloud services’ metered billing and could pose reputational risks. Moreover, dependence on key cloud infrastructure providers carries systemic risks, as we could face amplified reputational damage if observability features fail during client outages.\nFailure to comply with new and existing laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection, AI and information security could cause harm to our reputation, result in liability (including regulatory penalties and litigation), and adversely impact our business.\nOur business is increasingly subject to regulation by various federal, state and international governmental agencies responsible for enacting and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security. For example, since the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation became effective in 2018, the Court of Justice of the EU has issued rulings that have impacted how multinational companies must implement that law and the European Commission (EC) has published new regulatory\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrequirements relating to cross-border data transfers. NetApp relies on compliance methods such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to transfer personal data of individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) to other countries. In June 2021, the EC imposed new SCC requirements which impose certain contractual and operational requirements on NetApp and its contracting parties, including requirements related to government access transparency, enhanced data subject rights, and broader third-party assessments to ensure safeguards necessary to protect personal data transferred from NetApp or its partners to countries outside the EEA, requiring NetApp to revise customer and vendor agreements. Other global governments have adopted new privacy and data protection laws implementing similarly comprehensive regulatory frameworks.\nThe interpretation and application of many privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations, along with industry standards, are uncertain. These laws, regulations, or standards may be interpreted and applied in ways that are inconsistent with our data management practices or product features. Additionally, government certification requirements for products like ours may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or our business partners to comply with relevant laws, regulations, contractual commitments, required certifications, self-regulatory standards, or our policies could subject us to claims, investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal liability, penalties, or injunctions.\n \nAs a technology provider, our customers expect us to demonstrate compliance with privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. Our inability, or perceived inability, to do so may adversely impact sales of our products and services, especially to customers in highly regulated industries. We have invested resources in complying with new laws and regulations and may need to make additional significant changes to our business operations, which could adversely affect our revenue and overall business. Non-compliance could harm our reputation and brand, incur significant costs, materially affect our financial and operating results, and require modifications to our products or business practices.\nOur business could face stricter obligations, greater fines, and private causes of action under new privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations, including the GDPR, which provides for penalties of up to 20 million Euros or four percent of our total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher), the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and other similar U.S. state-based regulations, as well as new and emerging privacy laws globally.\nAs NetApp provides technology services to EU financial institutions, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) imposes financial and legal risks. These include compliance costs for enhancing cybersecurity, performing resilience testing, requiring comprehensive documentation, increased audits, and detailed reporting. Stricter contractual obligations will be imposed by financial institution clients, necessitating more robust incident reporting and data protection measures. Non-compliance could result in legal liabilities, suspension of services and reputational damage. Additionally, NetApp must ensure that its subcontractors and suppliers also comply with DORA requirements, further increasing the complexity and potential liability.\nIf our products or services are defective, or are perceived to be defective, including as a result of improper use or maintenance, our operating results and customer relationships may be harmed.\nOur products and services are complex. We have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, quality issues impacting certain products, and we could experience reliability issues with services we provide, including security vulnerabilities, software bugs, hardware failure in networked storage appliances, incompatibility issues with customer systems or other applications, performance deficiencies causing slow data retrieval or processing, firmware or software updates causing system instability, compliance with various product certifications, and data breaches due to flaws in the product design. Such quality and reliability issues may be due to, for example, our own designs or processes, the designs or processes of our suppliers, and/or flaws in third-party software used in our products. These types of risks are most acute when we are introducing new products. Quality or reliability issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service, data loss or data corruption. If we fail to remedy a product defect or flaw, we may experience a failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, loss of revenue, inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs, and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins, business and operating results. In addition, we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and services, and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products and services, which could lead to a perception of a quality or reliability issue. Customers may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects or flaws in our products and services, which could subject us to claims for damages, including consequential damages.\nChanges in regulations relating to our products or their components, or the manufacture, sourcing, distribution or use thereof, may harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, sourcing, distribution and use of our products have become increasingly complex and stringent. For example, in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions, the use and discharge of hazardous materials, and the use of certain minerals originating from identified conflict zones, many governments, including the U.S.,\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe United Kingdom, and Australia, have adopted regulations to address the risk of human trafficking in supply chains, which govern how workers are recruited and managed.\n \nWe incur costs to comply with these requirements. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell or the actions of our suppliers with respect to workers. As the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change, our costs are likely to rise, and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions, litigation risks and reputational harm.\nAny violation of U.S. export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold, distributed, or delivered could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nDue to the global nature of our business, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The U.S., through the BIS and OFAC, places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries, entities, and persons, including most recently to Russia, Belarus and regions of Ukraine. These regulations have caused us to temporarily stop selling or servicing our products temporarily in restricted areas.\n \nViolators of export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties, which may include significant monetary fines, criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government. Our products could be diverted by third parties (including potentially our channel partners) to countries or end users under sanctions / embargo orders, despite our precautions.\nIf we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws or any trade-related laws or regulations, even if inadvertent or without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Even if we were not found to have violated such laws, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm. Such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends significantly upon developing, maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees, resellers, strategic partners and customers, to protect our proprietary rights. We currently have multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple U.S. and international patents issued. The pending applications may not be approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated. We may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. Further, the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business. In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology. Any such litigation may be time-consuming and costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours. There is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us, which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advantages.\nWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\nWe compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business. Third parties have, from time to time, asserted intellectual property-related claims against us, including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by non-practicing entities. Such claims may be made against our products and services, our customers’ use of our products and services, or a combination of our products and third-party products. We also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to third-party intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them. If we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims, even in situations in which the third-party’s allegations are meritless, then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us.\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPatent litigation is particularly common in our industry. We have been, and continue to be, in active patent litigations with non-practicing entities. There is no guarantee that, in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation, we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost.  If a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products, affect our ability to supply or service our customers, and/or require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements.\n \nWe expect that companies in the enterprise storage and data management, and cloud storage, operational and workload services markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any such claims, and any such infringement claims discussed above, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause suspension of product shipments or product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n \nWe rely on software from third parties, and a failure to properly manage our use of third-party software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue.\n \nMany of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties. Such third-party software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public or open-source licenses.  We have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software. However, if we fail to adequately manage our use of third-party software, then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other third-party claims. If we are non-compliant with a license for commercial software, then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement. In the case of open-source software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses, the license itself may require, or a court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open-source software may require, that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed. Additionally, contract proposals, negotiations and software proposals are complex and frequently involve lengthy bidding and selection processes. We may not be able to negotiate extensions to our current third-party licenses when due for renewal or continue to secure such licenses under commercially reasonable terms. Each of the foregoing could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, increased costs, damage to our reputation and/or a loss of revenue.\nIn addition, many of our products use open-source software. Such open-source software generally does not provide any warranty or contractual protection and may be susceptible to compromise and supply-chain attacks by threat actors. Further, open-source software or third-party software may contain vulnerabilities, which may or may not be known at the time of our inclusion of the software in a product. If a vulnerability in such software is successfully exploited, we could be subject to damages including remediation costs, reputational damage, and lost revenues.\n \nOur failure to adjust to emerging standards may harm our business.\nEmerging standards may adversely affect the UNIX\n®\n, Windows\n®\n and World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend. For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations, certifications and controls with respect to data access, reliability and permanence in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate. If our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products, and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nOur stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors' or analysts' valuation measures for our stock, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt, changes in our credit ratings, our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends and economic volatility unrelated to our performance.\n \nIf we fail to meet any investor expectations related to dividends and/or stock repurchases, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence. Additionally, price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time.\nFurthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services, product enhancements or technological\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nadvances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially, which could harm our common stock price.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so, sometimes materially. All of the matters discussed in this Risk Factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year. In addition to those matters, we face the following issues, which could impact our quarterly results:\n \n•\nSeasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year;\n•\nLinearity, such as our historical intra-quarter customer orders and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total orders and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter; and\n•\nUnpredictability associated with larger scale enterprise software license agreements which generally take longer to negotiate and occur less consistently than other types of contracts, and for which revenue attributable to the software license component is typically recognized in full upon delivery.\nIf our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\n \nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\nAs of April 25, 2025, we had $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2025, 2027, 2030, 2032 and 2035. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities and/or enter into new financing arrangements. We may fail to pay these or additional future obligations, as and when required. Specifically, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows will be harmed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Rating Services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing, then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase.\n \nIn addition, all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants. If we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements. Moreover, compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nGeneral Risks\n \nOur business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events.\nWe depend on the ability of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world. Any political, military, terrorism, global trade, world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic impeded the mobility of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products and disrupted our business operations. Furthermore, any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters, including fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and volcanoes; power or water loss or shortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or break-ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. As a result of climate change, we expect the frequency and impact of such natural disasters or other material disruptions to increase. If such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on IT, or directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial and logistics functions, or impair our ability to meet our customer demands, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our headquarters is located in Northern California, an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires. If any significant disaster were to occur there, our ability to operate our business and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\n \nOur effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include among other things, fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business, changes to\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe tax laws in such jurisdictions and the outcome of income tax audits. Changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n \nWe receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non-U.S. customers. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits.\n \nMany countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (BEPS) recommendation and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result, many of these changes, if enacted in whole or in part, could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Implementation of the BEPS inclusive framework (Inclusive Framework), including potential incremental taxes under a new global minimum tax framework known as Pillar Two, is effective in most jurisdictions for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. We are currently subject to Pillar Two rules starting in our fiscal year 2025 and could potentially be subject to additional taxes under the Inclusive Framework. Amount B under Pillar One of the Inclusive Framework is related to standardized returns for baseline marketing and distribution activities. Amount B is applicable to NetApp beginning in fiscal 2026 and we could be subject to higher controlled profit requirements for some of our global distribution entities which could increase our global tax burden.\n \nOur effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain. Additionally, our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations, our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured, and as a result, we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition. We continue to evaluate the impacts of changes in tax laws and regulations on our business.\n \nWe are routinely subject to income tax audits in the U.S. and several foreign tax jurisdictions. If the ultimate determination of income taxes or at-source withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures.\nWe cannot be assured that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not exist in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, including in connection with our new ERP system, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities including equivalent foreign authorities. Further, irrespective of the controls that we adopt, we cannot be assured that we will not experience fraudulent financial reporting in the future, including earnings mismanagement, recording fictitious revenues, improper asset valuation, understating liabilities or expenses, inadequate disclosure, reserve manipulation, misuse of judgments in financial reporting, concealing fraud or illegal activities, information tampering, and insider trading based on non-public information about the Company's financials.\n \n \n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIt\nem 1B.  \nUnresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C.  \nCybersecurity\n \nRisk Management and Strategy\nThe Company regularly assesses risks from cybersecurity threats, monitors its information systems for potential vulnerabilities, and tests those systems pursuant to the Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices, which are \nintegrated\n into the Company’s overall risk management system. \nTo protect the Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security technologies and tools that help the Company identify, escalate, investigate, manage, resolve and recover from security incidents in a timely manner. These efforts include:\n•\nongoing collection of threat intelligence and environment awareness through monitoring,\n•\ndata protection management and vulnerability monitoring through data loss prevention and exfiltration tools,\n•\ncybersecurity risk management processes and practices,\n•\ncontrol assurance,\n•\nsecure development of new products,\n•\nidentity and access management,\n•\nincident response, auditing and monitoring, and \n•\nmaintaining a 24x7 security operations center to allow for always available incident response. \nThe Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and has implemented cybersecurity policies throughout its operations that are designed to address cybersecurity threats and incidents. In particular, the Company follows an incident escalation process that is incorporated into its incident and risk management processes. In the event the Company identifies a cybersecurity incident, its senior management, consisting of the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Administrative Officer, and Executive Vice President of Business Technology and Operations review the facts and circumstances involved in such cybersecurity incident, or series of related cybersecurity incidents.\nThe Company partners with third parties to assess the effectiveness of its cybersecurity prevention and response systems and processes, including third-party review of the Company’s Information Security Management System for ISO 27001 controls, assessment of the Company’s cloud products and managed services according to the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) Service Organization Control (SOC) Audit Type II, and new product validation as part of the Company’s secure development lifecycle. \nThe Company additionally \nengage\ns third-party providers in support of endpoint detection and responses, data loss prevention efforts, and incident management efforts.\nTo date, the Company is not aware of cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have \nmaterially affected\n or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For additional discussion of cybersecurity risks and potential related impacts on the Company, refer to the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” including “If a material cybersecurity or other security breach impacts our services, systems, supply chain, or end-user customer systems, or if stored data is improperly accessed, our business could suffer significant harm.\n”\n \nGovernance\nNetApp's\n Board of Directors oversees the Company’s risk management process, including cybersecurity risks, directly and through its committees.\n The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Company’s risk management program, which focuses on the most significant risks the Company faces in the short-, intermediate-, and long-term timeframes.\n The Company’s CISO regularly updates each of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee at least twice a year.  Such updates include a review of cybersecurity risks affecting the Company, related metrics, and any incidents or issues that require attention from the Board of Directors.\nThe CISO provides leadership, strategic direction, and oversight\n for NetApp’s Global Security Risk and Compliance functions and security program.\n Global Security executives oversee management of risks and track projects progress, remediations, and any issues related to cybersecurity risks.\nNetApp’s CISO is responsible for leading the assessment and management of cybersecurity risks. The current CISO has over 30 years of experience in IT and information security, including over 16 years with NetApp in roles of increasing seniority, and \nis a\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCertified Information Security Auditor, Certified Information Security Manager with ISACA and a Certified Information Systems Security Professional with ISC2\n.\n \nThe CISO stays informed on information security risks through regular meetings on key cybersecurity projects and KPIs. Updates are communicated to the Global Security Steering Committee, which \nprovides quarterly reports to the Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee.\n \nItem 2.  \nP\nroperties\nWe owned or leased, domestically and internationally, the following properties as of April 25, 2025.\nWe own approximately 0.8 million square feet of facilities in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. In addition, we own 65 acres of undeveloped land.

We also declared aggregate cash dividends of $2.08 per share in fiscal 2025, for which we paid a total of $424 million.\nRestructuring Events\nDuring fiscal 2025, we executed several restructuring plans and recognized expenses totaling $83 million consisting primarily of employee severance-related costs.\n \n Senior Notes Issuance\nIn March 2025, we issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2032 and \n$625 million aggregate principal amount of 5.70% Senior Notes due 2035, for which we received total proceeds of $1.24 billion, net of discount and issuance costs.\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResults of Operations\nOur fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, which ended on April 25, 2025, April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, respectively, are all 52-week years, with 13 weeks in each of their quarters.

Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased by approximately one percentage point in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, while services revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased by approximately one percentage point.\nThe decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due to a decrease in product revenues partially offset by an increase in services revenues. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased by approximately three percentage points in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, while services revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased by approximately three percentage points.\nSales through our indirect channels represented 78%, 76% and 78% of net revenues in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following customers, each of which is a distributor, accounted for 10% or more of net revenues:\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Electronics, Inc.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTD Synnex Corporation (previously presented as Tech Data Corporation)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nProduct Revenues (in millions, except percentages):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,040\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,849\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,049\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(7\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Cloud\nIn prior years, we presented the hardware and software components of our GAAP product revenues to illustrate the significance and value of the Company’s software. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. Effective in fiscal 2025, we are no longer presenting the non-GAAP hardware and software components of our product revenues, as management no longer considers them to be key financial measures. Our current strategy is expected to deliver investor value through growth in total revenues, including product revenues, while maintaining operational discipline to drive earnings leverage. While software continues to be the primary value driver of our products, NetApp is primarily focused on driving growth in total product revenues, through the sale of configured storage systems comprised of both hardware and software, with less focus on the pricing of each component. Additionally, we are considering potential opportunities to simplify pricing for certain products in the future, which may eliminate the existence of separate prices for hardware and software components and/or impact our ability to allocate between them.\nProduct revenues are derived through the sale of our Hybrid Cloud solutions and consist of sales of configured all-flash array systems (including All-Flash FAS A-Series and All-Flash FAS C-Series with capacity flash) and hybrid systems, which are bundled hardware and software products, as well as add-on flash, disk and/or hybrid storage and related OS, StorageGrid, OEM products, NetApp HCI and add-on optional software.\nTotal product revenues increased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher sales of C-Series all-flash array systems, partially offset by a decrease in sales of hybrid systems.\nTotal product revenues decreased in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower sales of hybrid systems due to softening customer demand, partially offset by an increase in sales of C-Series all-flash array systems.\nServices Revenues (in millions, except percentages):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,532\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,313\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,512\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,488\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional and other services\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n355\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n320\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n319\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic cloud\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n665\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n611\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n575\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \nHybrid Cloud\n \nHybrid Cloud services revenues are derived from the sale of: (1) support, which includes both hardware and software support contracts (the latter of which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements, bug fixes and patch releases), and (2) professional and other services, which include customer education and training.\nSupport revenues increased marginally in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 and increased in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 as a result of a higher aggregate support contract value for our installed base.\n \nProfessional and other services revenues increased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to an increase in revenues from our Keystone storage-as-a-service offering and remained relatively flat in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\nPublic Cloud\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic Cloud revenues are derived from the sale of public cloud offerings delivered primarily as-a-service, which include cloud storage, data services and operational services.\nPublic Cloud revenues increased in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 compared to the respective prior years primarily due to customer demand for NetApp’s diversified cloud offerings, coupled with overall growth in the cloud market.\nRevenues by Geographic Area:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States, Canada and Latin America (Americas)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific (APAC)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \nPercentages may not add due to rounding\n \nAmericas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and United States (U.S.) public sector markets.

The transaction resulted in a step-up of tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets, and accordingly, created a temporary difference where the tax basis exceeded the financial statement basis of such intangible assets, which resulted in the recognition of a discrete tax benefit and related deferred tax asset of $524 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Management applied significant judgment when determining the fair value of the IP, which serves as the tax basis of the deferred tax asset. With the assistance of third-party valuation specialists, the fair value of the IP was determined principally based on the present value of projected cash flows related to the IP which reflects management’s assumptions regarding projected revenues, earnings before interest and taxes, and a discount rate. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years the asset is expected to be realized. We expect to realize the deferred tax asset resulting from the IP Transfer and will assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset quarterly. Any Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s actions adopted internationally could impact our financial results in future periods. The impact of the transaction to net cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows during fiscal 2023 was not material.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Danish Supreme Court issued a non-appealable ruling on the distributions declared in 2005 and 2006. The Danish Supreme Court ruled the 2005 dividend was subject to at-source dividend withholding tax while the smaller 2006 distribution would not be subject to withholding tax. During fiscal 2023, we recorded $69 million of tax expense, which includes $23 million of withholding tax and $46 million of interest.\n \nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Requirements\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25,\n 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,846\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,252\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal amount of debt\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,400\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe following is a summary of our cash flow activities:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,506\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,685\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n147\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(735\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(828\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,344\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(19\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n840\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(413\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nAs of April 25, 2025, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.8 billion, reflecting an increase of $594 million from April 26, 2024. The increase was primarily due to $1.24 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes and $1.5 billion of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $1.2 billion used to repurchase shares of our common stock, a $400 million principal repayment of our 3.30% Senior Notes due September 2024, $424 million used for the payment of dividends, and $168 million in purchases of property and equipment. Net working capital was $1.2 billion as of April 25, 2025, an increase of $398 million when compared to April 26, 2024, primarily due to the increases in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments discussed above.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2025, cash provided by operating activities reflected net income of $1.2 billion which was increased for non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $243 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $386 million.\nSignificant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2025 included the following:\n•\nAccounts receivable\n increased by $219 million, primarily reflecting higher billing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. \n•\nDeferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue \nincreased by $208 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue for software and hardware support contracts.\n•\nLong-term taxes payable\n decreased by $207 million, primarily due to settlements associated with certain IRS tax examinations and changes in prior period tax positions.\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities reflected net income of $1.0 billion which was increased for non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $255 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $357 million.\nSignificant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2024 included the following:\n•\nAccounts payable \nincreased by $123 million, primarily reflecting the timing of inventory purchases from, and payments to, our contract manufacturers.\n•\nAccrued expenses \nincreased by $113 million, primarily due to higher employee compensation accruals as of the end of fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 related to incentive compensation and commissions plans.\nWe expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, shipping linearity, accounts receivable collections performance, inventory and supply chain management, vendor payment initiatives, and the timing and amount of compensation, income taxes and other payments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2025, we generated $245 million primarily from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid $168 million for capital expenditures. Additionally, we received proceeds of $70 million from the sale of our Spot by NetApp business.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we used $580 million for the purchases of investments, net of maturities and sales, and $155 million for capital expenditures.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2025, we used $1.2 billion for the repurchase of 10.2 million shares of common stock, $424 million for the payment of dividends and $400 million principal repayment upon maturity, partially offset by $1.24 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we used $900 million for the repurchase of 11.5 million shares of common stock, and $416 million for the payment of dividends.\nKey factors that that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We may choose to periodically raise additional debt capital based on certain conditions, including the refinancing of upcoming maturities and/or for potential strategic acquisitions and investments. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may pursue or need, will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the event our liquidity is insufficient and we are unable to enter into new financing arrangements, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels. For further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nLiquidity\nOur principal sources of liquidity as of April 25, 2025 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25,\n 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,742\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,903\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-term investments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,104\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,349\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,846\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,252\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of April 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings, while $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, were available in the U.S.\nOur principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies through asset purchases and/or business acquisitions, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in periodic reviews of opportunities to invest in or acquire companies or units in companies to expand our total addressable market, leverage technological synergies and establish new streams of revenue, particularly in our Public Cloud segment.\nThe principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of April 25, 2025.\nOur investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt, equity and other securities.\nSenior Notes\nThe following table summarizes the principal amount of our Senior Notes as of April 25, 2025 (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.875% Senior Notes Due June 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n750\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.375% Senior Notes Due June 2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n550\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.70% Senior Notes Due June 2030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n700\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.50% Senior Notes Due June 2032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n625\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.70% Senior Notes Due June 2035\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n625\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,250\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nInterest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 8 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nIn March 2025, we issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2032 and \n$625 million aggregate principal amount of 5.70% Senior Notes due 2035, for which we received total proceeds of $1.24 billion, net of discount and issuance costs. Interest on these Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in March and September.\nOn September 30, 2024, upon maturity, we repaid our 3.30% Senior Notes due September 2024 for an aggregate amount of $407 million, comprised of the principal and unpaid interest.\nCommercial Paper Program and Credit Facility\nWe have a commercial paper program (the “Program”), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion. The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. No commercial paper notes were outstanding as of April 25, 2025.\nIn connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders. The credit agreement, \nwhich was amended in March 2025, \nprovides for a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of $50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The credit facility matures on March 5, 2030, with an option for us\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto extend the maturity date for two additional 1-year periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program. As of April 25, 2025, we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement. No amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nWe expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors, including future demand for products, changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2026 to be between $175 million and $225 million.\nTransition Tax Payments\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposed a mandatory, one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits that had not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. As of April 25, 2025, a final transition tax payment of $178 million remains outstanding and is expected to be paid during fiscal 2026. During fiscal 2025, transition tax payments totaled $115 million.\nDividends and Stock Repurchase Program\nOn May 22, 2025, we declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock, payable on July 23, 2025 to holders of record as of the close of business on July 3, 2025.\nAs of April 25, 2025, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $17.1 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the May 13, 2003 inception of this program through April 25, 2025, we repurchased a total of 382 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $43.93 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.8 billion. As of April 25, 2025, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $0.4 billion. On May 22, 2025 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.1 billion of our common stock.\n \nPurchase Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services. These off-balance sheet purchase commitments totaled $1.0\n \nbillion at April 25, 2025, of which $0.6 billion is due in fiscal 2026, with the remainder due thereafter.\nFinancing Guarantees\nWhile most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We sold $65 million and $67 million of receivables during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nIn addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user.\n \nSome of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. As of April 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024, the aggregate amount\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nby which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.\nWe have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements. As of April 25, 2025, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets\n.\n \nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. See further details on such matters in Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.\nThe summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 – Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. The accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer. In determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition, we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price, which may include fixed and/or variable amounts, among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe evaluate whether products and services promised in our contracts with customers are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain contracts, the determination of our distinct performance obligations requires significant judgment. As our business and offerings to customers change over time, the products and services we determine to be distinct performance obligations may change. Such changes may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn determining the transaction price of our contracts, we estimate variable consideration based on the expected value, primarily relying on our history. In certain situations, we may also use the most likely amount as the basis of our estimate.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWe may have insufficient relevant historical data or other information to arrive at an accurate estimate of variable consideration using either the “expected value” or “most likely amount” method. Additionally, changes in business practices, such as those related to sales returns or marketing programs,   may introduce new forms of variable consideration, as well as more complexity and uncertainty in the estimation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contracts with multiple performance obligations, we establish SSPs based on the price at which products and services are sold separately. If SSPs are not observable through past transactions, we estimate them by maximizing the use of observable inputs including pricing strategy, market data, internally-approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations and other observable inputs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAs our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of product and service offerings and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain SSPs. Changes in SSPs could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.\n \n\n\n\n\nInventory Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals\nInventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. A provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory. Inventories are written down based on excess and obsolete reserves determined primarily on assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we use our best estimates to forecast future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand, including due to macroeconomic uncertainties, or obsolescence related to technological developments, new product introductions, customer requirements, competition or other factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of our inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings that adversely impact gross margins may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold.\n \nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the manufacture of our products. If there are changes to the current regulations, we may be required to make product design changes which may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely impact our operating results.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers and other suppliers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIf the actual materials demand is significantly lower than our forecast, we may be required to increase our recorded liabilities for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments.\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. This review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of income.\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of one of our reporting units may exceed its fair value. The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. For our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment by evaluating relevant factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is less than their carrying values. As a result of the qualitative assessment, we determined the quantitative test was not necessary and there was no impairment of goodwill.\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.\nThe valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets from the acquired business.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we employ experts to determine the acquisition date fair value of acquired intangibles, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on significant management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluations of possible goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment require us to make judgments and assumptions related to the allocation of our balance sheet and income statement amounts and estimate future cash flows and fair market values of our reporting units and assets.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.\n \nAssumptions and estimates about expected future cash flows and the fair values of our reporting units and purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the adverse impact of unanticipated changes in macroeconomic conditions, and technological changes or new product introductions from competitors. They can also be affected by internal factors such as changes in business strategy or in forecasted product life cycles and roadmaps. Our ongoing consideration of these and other factors could result in future impairment charges or accelerated amortization expense, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes:\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur income tax provision is based on existing tax law and advanced pricing agreements or letter rulings we have with various tax authorities.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by future changes in existing tax laws, such as a change in tax rate, possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and uncertainties as to future renewals of favorable tax agreements and rulings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe determination of whether we should record or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our future profitability.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOur future profits could differ from current expectations resulting in a change to our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. We could adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimates for our uncertain tax positions are based primarily on company specific circumstances, applicable tax laws, tax opinions from outside firms and past results from examinations of our income tax returns.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome or tax court rulings of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nIt\nem 7A.  \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are used in accordance with management-approved policies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nFixed Income Investments\n — As of April 25, 2025, we had fixed income debt investments of $2.0 billion and certificates of deposit of $24 million. Our fixed income debt investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase, which are classified as available-for-sale investments. These fixed income debt investments, which consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and government debt securities, and our certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of April 25, 2025 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-income securities of $3 million. Volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.\n \nOur investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company-specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value. We monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any impairments.\nDebt\n — As of April 25, 2025 we have outstanding $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 8 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information.\nCredit Facility\n — We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our Senior Notes. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. As of April 25, 2025, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging.\nWe do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes. In entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of 12 months or less. See Note 11 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities.\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIt\nem 8.  \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n

Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\n — NetApp, Inc. (we, us, NetApp, or the Company) helps customers make their data infrastructure more seamless, more dynamic, and higher performing. We provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services that customers use to transform their data infrastructures across data types, workloads, and environments to realize business possibilities.\nFiscal Year\n — Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, which ended on April 25, 2025, April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, respectively, are all 52-week years, with 13 weeks in each of their quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended on the last Friday of April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years\n.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n — The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\n \nUse of Estimates\n — The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, reserves and allowances; inventory valuation; valuation of goodwill and intangibles; restructuring reserves; employee benefit accruals; stock-based compensation; loss contingencies; investment impairments; income taxes and fair value measurements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates, the anticipated effects of which have been incorporated, as applicable, into management’s estimates as of and for the year ended April 25, 2025\n.\nCash Equivalents\n — We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\n — We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale investments. Debt securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit. These investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of debt securities sold. These investments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.\nUnrealized gains and temporary losses, net of related taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Upon realization, those amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments are included in our results of operations. Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific identification method.\nWe classify our investments as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nImpairments on Investments\n — All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to periodic impairment review. When the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess what amount of the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. The amount of the difference representing credit losses (defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security) is recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). If we intend to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the debt security is recognized in earnings.\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInventories\n — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We write down excess and obsolete inventory based on the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value. Net realizable value is estimated using management’s best estimate of forecasts for future demand and expectations regarding market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis. In addition, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\n — Property and equipment are recorded at cost.\n \nDepreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method, generally over the following periods:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuildings and improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n to \n40 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurniture and fixtures\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer, production, engineering and other equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n to \n3 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer software\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n to \n5 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\n\n \n\n\nShorter of remaining lease term or useful life\n\n\n\n\n \nConstruction in progress will be depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for use. We capitalize interest on significant facility assets under construction and on significant software development projects. Interest capitalized during the periods presented was not material.\nSoftware Development Costs\n — The costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for software. Because our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been capitalized for any of the periods presented.\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\n — We capitalize qualifying costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, for computer software developed or obtained for internal-use to property and equipment, net and amortize them over the software’s estimated useful life.\nBusiness Combinations\n — We recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, with the exception of contract assets and liabilities, which we recognize in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as if we had originally executed the customer contract. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\n — Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic lives of \nthree\n to \nfive years\n for developed technology, \ntwo\n to \nfive years\n for customer contracts/relationships, \ntwo\n to \nthree years\n for covenants not to compete and \ntwo\n to \nfive years\n for trademarks and trade names as we believe this method most closely reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed. In-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset and is assessed for potential impairment annually until development is complete or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired. Upon completion of development, in-process research and development is accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset.\nThe carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. For the purpose of impairment testing, we have two reporting units, which are the same as our two reportable segments. We initially conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The performance of the quantitative impairment test requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach.\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnder the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations, and are derived based on forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins. These cash flow projections are discounted to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit. \nAn impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount. The impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, with the recognized loss not to exceed the total amount of allocated goodwill. We did not recognize any impairment charges on our goodwill in any of the periods presented.\n \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n — We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances, such as reductions in demand, lower projections of profitability, significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets, or significant negative industry or economic trends, indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. If this review indicates that there is an impairment, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted market prices and/or (ii) expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate. Our estimates regarding future anticipated cash flows, the remaining economic life of the products and technologies, or both, may differ materially from actual cash flows and remaining economic life. In that event, impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets may be required, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of income when such determinations are made.\nDerivative Instruments\n — Our derivative instruments, which are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, consist of foreign currency exchange contracts as described below:\nBalance Sheet Hedges\n — We utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged, and the net amount is included in earnings.\nCash Flow Hedges\n — We utilize foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and, in general, closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The effective portion of the contracts’ gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value is recorded in AOCI until the forecasted transaction is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. When the forecasted transactions occur, we reclassify the related gains or losses on the cash flow hedges into net revenues. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI and recognized immediately in earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair values of the designated foreign currency exchange forward purchase contracts with the fair values of the forecasted transactions.\nFactors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging programs include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Currently, we do not enter into any foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments. Cash flows from our derivative programs are included under operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\n — We recognize revenue by applying the following five step approach.\n•\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer —\n A contract with a customer is within the scope of ASC 606 when it meets all the following criteria:\n-\nIt is enforceable\n-\nIt defines each party’s rights\n-\nIt identifies the payment terms\n-\nIt has commercial substance, and\n-\nWe determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that will be transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay \n \n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract \n— Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services (or a bundle of goods and services) that will be transferred to the customer that are distinct. \n \n•\nDetermination of the transaction price\n \n— The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. \n \n•\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n \n— Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation.\n•\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\n \n— We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time.\nCustomarily we have a purchase order from or executed contract with our customers that establishes the goods and services to be transferred and the consideration to be received.\n \nWe combine two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer as a single contract if the contracts are negotiated as one package with a single commercial objective, if the amount of consideration to be paid on one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract or if the goods and services promised in each of the contracts are a single performance obligation.\nOur contracts with customers may include hardware systems, software licenses, software support, hardware support, public cloud services and other services. Software support contracts entitle our customers to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, and patch releases. Hardware support services include contracts for extended warranty and technical support with minimum response times. Other services include professional services and customer education and training services.\n \nWe identify performance obligations in our contracts to be those goods and services that are distinct. A good or service is distinct where the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and is distinct in the context of the contract, where the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\n \nIf a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are distinct. If they are not, we combine the goods and services until we have a distinct performance obligation. For example, a configured storage system inclusive of the operating system (OS) software essential to its functionality is considered a single performance obligation, while optional add-on software is a separate performance obligation. In general, hardware support, software support, and different types of professional services are each separate performance obligations.\nWe determine the transaction price of our contracts with customers based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services. Consideration promised may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. We sell public cloud services either on a subscription basis or a consumption basis. We sell professional services either on a time and materials basis or under fixed price projects.\nWe evaluate variable consideration in arrangements with contract terms such as rights of return, potential penalties and acceptance clauses. We generally use the expected value method, primarily relying on our history, to estimate variable consideration. However, when we believe it to provide a better estimate, we use the most likely amount method. In either case, we consider variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Reassessments of our variable consideration may occur as historical information changes. Transaction prices are also adjusted for the effects of time value of money if the timing of payments provides either the customer or us a significant benefit of financing.\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price by maximizing the use of observable inputs including pricing strategy, market data, internally-approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations and other observable inputs. We regularly review standalone selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. Variable consideration is also allocated to the performance obligations. If the terms of variable consideration relate to one performance obligation, it is entirely allocated to that obligation. Otherwise, it is allocated to all the performance obligations in the contract.\nWe \ntypically recognize revenue at a point in time upon the transfer of goods to a customer. Products we transfer at a point in time include our configured hardware systems, OS software licenses, optional add-on software licenses and add-on hardware. Services are typically transferred over time and revenue is recognized based on an appropriate method for measuring our progress toward\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncompletion \nof the performance obligation. Our stand-ready services, including both hardware and software support, are transferred ratably over the period of the contract. Our public cloud services are transferred either 1) for subscription arrangements, ratably over the subscription period or 2) for consumption-based arrangements, as actually consumed by the customer. For other services such as our fixed professional services contracts, we use an input method to determine the percentage of completion. That is, we estimate the effort to date versus the expected effort required over the life of the contract. \n \nDeferred Commissions \n—\n \nWe capitalize sales commissions that are incremental direct costs of obtaining customer contracts for which revenue is not immediately recognized and classify them as current or non-current based on the terms of the related contracts. Capitalized commissions are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which they relate, typically over \none\n to \nthree years\n, and are also periodically reviewed for impairment. Amortization expense is recorded to sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nLeases\n — We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, and we classify leases as operating or finance leases at commencement. In our consolidated balance sheets, operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets are included in other non-current assets, while finance lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment, net. Lease liabilities for both types of leases are included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over that term.\n \n \nOperating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and exclude lease incentives. The lease term is the noncancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised. As the rate implicit in our leases is typically not readily determinable, in computing the present value of lease payments we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are expensed as incurred and not included within the calculation of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe do not separate non-lease components from lease components for any class of leases, and we do not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.\nForeign Currency Translation\n — For international subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in AOCI. For international subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in other (expense) income, net.\nBenefit Plans\n — We record actuarial gains and losses associated with defined benefit plans within AOCI and amortize net gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year or the plans' projected benefit obligation on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of plan participants. The measurement date for all defined benefit plans is our fiscal year end.\nStock-Based Compensation\n — We measure and recognize stock-based compensation for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), including time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs (PBRSUs), and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial statements using the straight-line attribution approach over the requisite service period for the entire award.\nThe fair value of employee time-based RSUs, and PBRSUs that include a performance condition, is equal to the market value of our common stock on the grant date of the award, less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, discounted at a risk-free interest rate. The fair value of PBRSUs that include a market condition is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of time-based RSUs, and PBRSUs that include a market condition, is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations. When there is a change in management’s estimate of expected achievement relative to the performance target for PBRSUs that include a performance condition, such as our achievement against a billings result average target, the change in estimate results in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment of stock-based compensation expense.\nOur expected term assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and post-vesting forfeiture experience. Our stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of our historical and implied volatility. The risk-free interest rates are based upon United States (U.S.) Treasury bills with equivalent expected terms, and the expected dividends are based on our history and expected dividend payouts.\nWe account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n — Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will result in tax deductions or income in future periods, as well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated realizable value.\n \nWe recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes line on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nNet Income per Share\n — Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to the weighted-average number of dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potential dilutive common shares consist primarily of outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under our employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs.\nTreasury Stock\n — We account for treasury stock under the cost method. Upon the retirement of treasury stock, we allocate the value of treasury shares between common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement. The standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented in the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The requirements should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on our disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required for income taxes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on our income tax disclosures.\n \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. We adopted this standard for our annual period beginning fiscal year 2025 on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The adoption o\nf this standard did not result in a significant change to our consolidated financial statement disclosures. See Note 15 – Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our reportable segment disclosures.\n3. Concentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts and accounts receivable. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents with several major financial institutions where the deposits exceed federally insured limits. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of money market funds, U.S. Treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit, all of which are considered high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. General macroeconomic uncertainty has led to an increase in market volatility, however, management believes that the financial institutions that hold our cash, cash equivalents and investments are financially sound and, accordingly, are subject to minimal credit risk.\nBy entering into foreign currency exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe sell our products primarily to large organizations in different industries and geographies. We do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on our customers’ financial condition. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information, including the expected impact of macroeconomic disruptions, and, to date, such losses have been within management’s expectations. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers who are dispersed across many geographic regions.\nThere are no concentrations of business transacted with a particular market that would severely impact our business in the near term. However, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any disruption, or termination of these arrangements could materially adversely affect our operating results.\n4. Business Combinations\n \nFiscal 2023 Acquisition\n \nInstaclustr Acquisition\nOn May 20, 2022, we acquired all the outstanding shares of privately-held Instaclustr US Holding, Inc. (Instaclustr) for $\n498\n million. Instaclustr is a leading platform provider of fully managed open-source database, pipeline and workflow applications delivered as-a-service.\nThe acquisition-date values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntangible assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n107\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n413\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets acquired\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n543\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities assumed\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n45\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal purchase price\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n498\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe components of the intangible assets acquired were as follows (in millions, except useful life):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated useful life\n(years)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped technology\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n55\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer contracts/relationships\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade name\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal intangible assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n107\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe acquired net assets and assumed debt of Instaclustr were recorded at their estimated values. We determined the estimated values with the assistance of valuations and appraisals performed by third party specialists and estimates made by management. We expect to realize revenue synergies and anticipate opportunities for growth through the ability to leverage additional future products and capabilities. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated value of its identifiable net assets acquired, and as a result, we have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\n \nThe results of operations related to the acquisition of Instaclustr have been included in our consolidated statements of income from the acquisition date.

See Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related to these arrangements.\nDuring the years ended April 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024\n, we recognized revenue of $\n2,176\n million and $\n2,218\n million, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue balance at the beginning of the respective periods.\n \nRemaining performance obligations\n As of April 25, 2025, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations related to \ncustomer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $\n5.0\n billion. Because customer orders are typically placed on an as-needed basis, and cancellable without penalty prior to shipment, orders in backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future r\nevenue and have not been included in this amount. We expect to recognize as revenue approximately \n49\n% of our remaining performance obligations in the next \n12 months\n and the remainder thereafter.\nDeferred commissions\n \nThe following table summarizes deferred commissions balances as reported in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25,\n 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther current assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n64\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n69\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n104\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal deferred commissions\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n168\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n169\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDuring the years ended April 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024\n, we recognized amortization expense from deferred commissions of $\n123\n million and $\n101\n million, respectively, and there were \nno\n impairment charges recognized.\nOther income, net (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n112\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n112\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n69\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n64\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n64\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n67\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal other income, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n49\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOther, net for fiscal 2023 includes $\n22\n million of other income for non-refundable, up-front payments from customers in Russia for support contracts, which we were not able to fulfill due to imposed sanctions and for which we have no remaining legal obligation to perform.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nThe accounting guidance for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby the inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the three levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1\n: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2:\n Inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3:\n Unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nWe consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and consider an inactive market to be one in which there are infrequent or few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate, our own or the counterparty’s non-performance risk is considered in measuring the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.\nInvestments\nThe following is a summary of our investments at their cost or amortized cost as of \nApril 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024 (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25,\n 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Treasury and government debt securities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,349\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney market funds\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,126\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,161\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificates of deposit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutual funds\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal debt and equity securities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,216\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,560\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe fair value of our investments approximates their cost or amortized cost for both periods presented.

instruments are held by a custodian who prices some of the investments using standard inputs in various asset price models or obtains investment prices from third-party pricing providers that incorporate standard inputs in various asset price models. These pricing providers utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. We review Level 2 inputs and fair value for reasonableness and the values may be further validated by comparison to multiple independent pricing sources. In addition, we review third-party pricing provider models, key inputs and assumptions and understand the pricing processes at our third-party providers in determining the overall reasonableness of the fair value of our Level 2 debt instruments.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Senior Notes under specified terms. The Senior Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens on assets or on shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries; to engage in certain sale and lease-back transactions; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

Amounts available under the Program, as amended in July 2017, may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $\n1.0\n billion. The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed \n397\n days from the date of issue. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. \nThere were \nno\n commercial paper notes outstanding as of \nApril 25, 2025 or April 26, 2024.\nIn connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders. The credit agreement, \nwhich was amended in March 2025, \nprovides for a $\n1.0\n billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of $\n50\n million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The credit facility matures on \nMarch 5, 2030\n, with an option for us to extend the maturity date for \ntwo\n additional \n1\n-year periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program. As of \nApril 25, 2025\n, we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement. \nNo\n amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented.\n \n \n9. Leases\n \nWe lease real estate, equipment and automobiles in the U.S. and internationally. Our real estate leases, which are responsible for the majority of our aggregate ROU asset and liability balances, include leases for office space, data centers and other facilities, and as of April 25, 2025\n, have remaining lease terms not exceeding \n17\n years. Some of these leases contain options that allow us to extend or terminate the lease agreement. Our equipment leases are primarily for servers and networking equipment and as of \nApril 25, 2025\n, have remaining lease terms not exceeding \n4\n years. As of \nApril 25, 2025, our automobile leases have remaining lease terms not exceeding 5 years.

Stockholders’ Equity\nEquity Incentive Programs\nThe 2021 Plan\n — The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan) was adopted by our Board of Directors and approved by the stockholders on September 10, 2021. The 2021 Plan replaced the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the 1999 Plan), and the 1999 Plan terminated effective as of September 11, 2021, except that the 1999 Plan will continue to govern awards outstanding thereunder as of the date of such plan’s termination and such awards will continue in force and effect until terminated pursuant to their terms. The 2021 Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards to our employees, directors, and consultants.\nUnder the 2021 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees, nonemployee directors, consultants and independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during their period of service. The exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less than \n100\n% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The 2021 Plan prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved by stockholders. RSUs granted under the 2021 Plan include time-based RSUs that generally vest over a \nfour-year\n period with \n25\n% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and \n6.25\n% vesting quarterly thereafter. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) has the discretion to use different vesting schedules. In addition, performance-based RSUs may be granted under the 2021 Plan and are subject to performance criteria and vesting terms specified by the Compensation Committee.\n During fiscal 2025\n, the shares reserved for issuance under the Plan were increased by \n3\n million shares of common stock. \nAs of April 25, 2025\n, \n11\n million shares were available for grant under the 2021 Plan.\nRestricted Stock Units\nIn fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, \nwe granted PBRSUs to certain of our executives. Each PBRSU has performance-based vesting criteria (in addition to the service-based vesting criteria) such that the PBRSUs cliff-vest at the end of a \nthree year\n performance period, which began on the date specified in the grant agreements and typically ends on the last day of the third fiscal year, following the grant date. The number of shares that will be used to calculate the settlement amount for all of these PBRSUs at the end of the applicable performance and service period will range from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of a target number of shares originally granted.\n For half of the PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2025 and 2024, and for most of the PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2023, \nthe \nnumber of shares used to calculate\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe \nsettlement amount will depend upon our Total Stockholder Return (TSR) as compared to the TSR of a specified group of benchmark peer companies (each expressed as a growth rate percentage) calculated as of the end of the performance period.\n For the remaining half of the PBRSUs granted in the fiscal \n2025 and 2024\n, the number of shares used to calculate the settlement amount will depend upon the Company's billings result average over the three-year performance period. The billings result average is computed based on achievement against annual billings targets, with each target set at the beginning of the respective fiscal year, during the three-year performance period. Billings for purposes of measuring the performance of these PBRSUs means the total obtained by adding net revenues as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income to the amount reported as the change in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable measurement period, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n \nThe aggregate grant date fair value of all PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023\n was $\n67\n million, $\n39\n million and $\n28\n million, respectively, and these amounts are being recognized to compensation expense over the remaining performance/service periods.\n \nAs of April 25, 2025, April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023\n, there were approximately \n1\n million PBRSUs outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes information related to RSUs, including PBRSUs (in millions, except for fair value):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of\nShares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date \nFair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 29, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n64.09\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n59.87\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n62.85\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n61.99\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 28, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n62.08\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n76.46\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n59.32\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n65.17\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 26, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n68.87\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n123.45\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n72.07\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n78.21\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 25, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n91.30\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nWe primarily use the net share settlement approach upon vesting, where a portion of the shares are withheld as settlement of employee withholding taxes, which decreases the shares issued to the employee by a corresponding value. \nThe number and value of the shares netted for employee taxes are summarized in the table below (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares withheld for taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair value of shares withheld\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n199\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n128\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n84\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nEligible employees are offered shares through a \n24\n-month offering period, which consists of \nfour\n consecutive \n6\n-month purchase periods.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The maximum length of time over which forecasted foreign currency denominated revenues are hedged is 12 months. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet their obligations under the terms of our agreements. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place master netting arrangements to mitigate the credit risk of our counterparties and to potentially reduce our losses due to counterparty nonperformance.

Restructuring Charges\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, management approved a restructuring plan to redirect resources to the highest return activities and reduce costs. Charges related to the plan consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs and lease termination charges. The activities under the plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nIn the first nine months of fiscal 2025, management approved restructuring plans to redirect resources to the highest return activities and reduce costs, which included in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a plan approved related to the sale of our cloud optimization and management software business known as Spot by NetApp. Charges related to the plans consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs. The activities under these plans were substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2025.\nIn fiscal 2024, management approved restructuring plans to redirect resources to the highest return activities and reduce costs. Charges related to the plans consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs. One of the plans also included termination of certain real estate leases in various countries, resulting in lease termination charges. The activities under these plans were substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2024.\nIn fiscal 2023, we executed, or continued to execute, restructuring plans to redirect resources to the highest return activities, reduce costs and establish our international headquarters in Cork, Ireland. These plans resulted in restructuring charges comprised primarily of employee severance-related costs and legal and tax-related professional fees.

The transaction resulted in a step-up of tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets, and accordingly, created a temporary difference where the tax basis exceeded the financial statement basis of such intangible assets, which resulted in the recognition of a discrete tax benefit and related deferred tax asset of $\n524\n million \nduring the second quarter of fiscal 2023.  Management applied significant judgment when determining the fair value of the IP, which serves as the tax basis of the deferred tax asset. With the assistance of third-party valuation specialists, the fair value of the IP was determined principally based on the present value of projected cash flows related to the IP which reflects management’s assumptions regarding projected revenues, earnings before interest and taxes, and a discount rate. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years the asset is expected to be realized. We\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nexpect \nto realize the deferred tax asset resulting from the IP Transfer and will assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset quarterly.\n \nIn September 2010, the Danish Tax Authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 by our Danish subsidiary were subject to Danish at-source dividend withholding tax. We did not believe that our Danish subsidiary was liable for such withholding tax and filed an appeal with the Danish Tax Tribunal, which issued a ruling in favor of NetApp in December 2011. However, following escalations within the Danish judicial system over the course of numerous years, on January 9, 2023, the Danish Supreme Court ruled the 2005 dividend was subject to withholding tax while the smaller 2006 distribution would not be subject to withholding tax. The Danish Supreme Court ruling on the distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 is non-appealable. During fiscal 2023, we recorded $\n69\n million of discrete tax expense, which includes $\n23\n million of withholding tax and $\n46\n million of interest.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax computed at federal statutory rate\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n290\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n265\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n224\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n14\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n40\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n43\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n21\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and development credits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n31\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n22\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n24\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit for foreign derived intangible income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n28\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal minimum tax on intangible income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax charges (benefits) from integration of acquired companies\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n27\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax benefit due to IP Transfer\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n524\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution of income tax matters \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n39\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n197\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n277\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n208\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nDuring fiscal 2025, we recognized a tax benefit related to the IRS examination of our fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 U.S. income tax returns.

The decrease is mainly attributable to corresponding changes in deferred tax assets, primarily certain state tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of April 25, 2025, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n9\n million. In addition, we have gross state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $\n4\n million and $\n146\n million, respectively. The majority of the state credit carryforwards are California research credits which are offset by a valuation allowance as we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized. We also have $\n9\n million of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards and $\n33\n million of foreign tax credit carryforwards of which the majority were generated by our Dutch subsidiary and are fully offset by a valuation allowance. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. \nThe state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2026 through 2042.\n The federal net operating loss carryforwards, the California research credit, and the Dutch foreign tax credit carryforwards do not expire.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n220\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n222\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n220\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases for tax positions of prior years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n25\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettlements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n139\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n68\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n220\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n222\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAs of April 25, 2025\n, we had $\n68\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $\n45\n million has been recorded in other long-term liabilities. Unrecognized tax benefits of $\n47\n million, including penalties, interest and indirect benefits, would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized.\n \nWe recognized expense for increases to accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of $\n4\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n7\n million, respectively, in fiscal \n2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023\n. Accrued interest and penalties of $\n8\n million and $\n33\n million were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of \nApril 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024, respectively.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) recently enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework known as Pillar Two. These rules have been agreed to by most OECD members. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of Pillar Two rules. On February 1, 2023, the FASB indicated that they believe taxes imposed under Pillar Two is an alternative minimum tax. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the minimum tax would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated future effects of the minimum tax but would be recognized in the period incurred. We are currently subject to Pillar Two rules starting in our fiscal year 2025. As of April 25, 2025, Pillar Two taxes do not have a significant impact on our financial statements, particularly due to the safe harbor relief during the transition period, but we are still closely monitoring developments.\nThe tax years that remain subject to examination for our major tax jurisdictions are shown below:\nFiscal Years Subject to Examination for Major Tax Jurisdictions at April 25, 2025\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nUnited States — federal income tax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nUnited States — state and local income tax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2007\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Netherlands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nCanada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nJapan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 \n— \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nCyprus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nFrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n — \n2025\n\n\n \n\n\nIreland\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nWe are currently undergoing various income tax audits in the U.S. and audits in several foreign tax jurisdictions. Transfer pricing calculations are key topics under these audits and are often subject to dispute and appeals.\nWe continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude, certain statutes of limitations will lapse, or both. As a result of uncertainties regarding tax audits and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of possible impacts to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months cannot be made at this time.\n As of April 25, 2025\n, we continue to record a deferred tax liability related to state taxes on unremitted earnings of certain foreign entities. We estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the earnings we expect to be indefinitely reinvested to be immaterial. We will continue to monitor our plans to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and will assess the related unrecognized deferred tax liability considering our ongoing projected global cash requirements, tax consequences associated with repatriation and any U.S. or foreign government programs designed to influence remittances.\n \n \n14.

Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information\nOur operations are organized into two segments: Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud. The two segments are based on the information reviewed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Chief Executive Officer, to evaluate results and allocate resources. The CODM measures performance of each segment based on segment revenue and segment gross profit by comparing actual revenue and gross profit results to historical results and previously forecasted financial information. We do not allocate to our segments certain cost of revenues which we manage at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We do not allocate assets to our segments.\n \nHybrid Cloud \noffers a unified data storage portfolio of storage management and infrastructure solutions that helps customers modernize their data centers. This portfolio accommodates both structured and unstructured data with unified storage optimized for flash, disk, and cloud storage, capable of handling data-intensive workloads and applications. Hybrid Cloud includes software, hardware, and related support, along with professional and other services.\nPublic Cloud \noffers a portfolio of products delivered primarily as-a-service, including related support. This portfolio includes cloud storage, data services, and operational services. Public Cloud includes certain reseller arrangements in which the timing of our consideration follows the end user consumption of the reseller services.\n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSegment Revenues and

Employee Benefits and Deferred Compensation\nEmployee 401(k) Plan\nOur 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit. We match \n100\n% of the first \n2\n% of eligible earnings an employee contributes to the 401(k) Plan, and then match \n50\n% of the next \n4\n% of eligible earnings an employee contributes. \nAn employee receives the full 4% match when he/she contributes at least \n6\n% of his/her eligible earnings, up to a maximum calendar year matching contribution of $\n6,000\n.\n \nOur employer matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 25, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n401(k) matching contributions\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n29\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nDeferred Compensation Plan\nWe have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows a group of employees within the U.S. to contribute base salary and commissions or incentive compensation on a tax deferred basis in excess of the IRS limits imposed on 401(k) plans.

Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Orders and Other Commitments\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consist of firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. As of April 25, 2025\n, we had $\n0.4\n billion in non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory. We record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of \nApril 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024\n, such liability amounted to $\n22\n million and $\n20\n million, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.\nIn addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services. As of April 25, 2025\n, we had $\n0.6\n billion in other purchase obligations.\nOf the total $\n1.0\n billion in purchase commitments, $\n0.6\n billion is due in fiscal \n2026, with the remainder due thereafter.\n \nFinancing Guarantees\nWhile most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance. We sold $\n65\n million, $\n67\n million and $\n38\n million of receivables during fiscal \n2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nIn addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the end-user customer, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\n \nSome of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally \nthree years\n or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases and collectability is probable, we account for these transactions as sales type leases. If collectability is not probable, the cash received is recorded as a deposit liability and revenue is deferred until the arrangement is deemed collectible. For leases that we are not a party to, other than providing recourse, we recognize revenue when control is transferred. As of \nApril 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.\nWe have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid financing payments under such arrangements. As of April 25, 2025, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets\n.\nLegal Contingencies\nWhen a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.\n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. We may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights, including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by non-practicing entities. We are currently involved in patent litigation brought by non-practicing entities and other third parties. We believe we have strong arguments that our products do not infringe and/or the asserted patents are invalid, and we intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’ claims. However, there is no guarantee that we will prevail at trial and if a jury were to find that our products infringe, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages, and may cause product shipment delays or stoppages, require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\n \nAlthough management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include significant monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and overall trends\n. \nNo\n material accrual has been recorded as of \nApril 25, 2025\n related to such matters.\n \n \n\n\n88\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST\nERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n \nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of NetApp, Inc.\n \n \nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NetApp, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of \nApril 25, 2025, and April 26, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended April 25, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 25, 2025, and April 26, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 25, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 25, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated June 9, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n \n \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n \nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue — Refer to Notes 1, 6, and 15 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer, such as hardware systems, software licenses, software support, hardware support, public cloud services and other services. Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company is required to evaluate whether each performance obligation represents goods and services that are distinct for purposes of determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition. A good or service is distinct where the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and is distinct in the context of the contract, where the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The evaluation of performance obligations can require significant judgment in certain contracts and could change the amount of revenue recognized in a given period.\nWe identified the evaluation of performance obligations in certain contracts as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment management makes in evaluating such contracts and the impact of such judgment on the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of testing.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n   Our audit procedures related to the Company’s evaluation of performance obligations for certain contracts included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to management’s review of contracts to evaluate and determine distinct performance obligations.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to revenue recognition for reasonableness and compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n•\nWe selected a sample of certain contracts with customers and performed the following:\no\nObtained and read contract source documents, including master agreements, amendments, and other documents that were part of the contract.\no\nEvaluated the terms and conditions in the contract source documents and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of their accounting policies in the evaluation of performance obligations.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nRaleigh, North Carolina\nJune 9, 2025\n \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1995.\n \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of NetApp, Inc.\n \nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n     We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of April 25, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 25, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\n     We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended April 25, 2025, of the Company and our report dated June 9, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\n \n     The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n     We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n     A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nRaleigh, North Carolina\nJune 9, 2025\n \n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIt\nem 9.  \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nIt\nem 9A.  \nControls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe phrase “disclosure controls and procedures” refers to controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of April 25, 2025, the end of the fiscal period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of April 25, 2025, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 25, 2025 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nIt\nem 9B.
