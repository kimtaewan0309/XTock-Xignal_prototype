(the Parent), along with its consolidated entities (collectively, Invesco or the company), is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering a superior investment experience. Our comprehensive range of active, passive and alternative investment capabilities has been constructed over many years to help clients achieve their investment objectives. We draw on this comprehensive range of capabilities to provide solutions designed to deliver key outcomes aligned to client needs.\nWith approximately 8,500 employees and an on-the-ground presence in more than 20 countries, Invesco is well positioned to meet the needs of investors across the globe. We have specialized investment teams managing investments across a broad range of asset classes, investment styles and geographies. For decades, individuals and institutions have viewed Invesco as a trusted partner for a comprehensive set of investment needs. We have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC), serving clients in more than 120 countries. As of December 31, 2024, the firm managed approximately $1.85 trillion in assets for investors around the world.\nThe key drivers of success for Invesco are long-term investment performance, high-quality client service, effective distribution relationships delivered across a diverse spectrum of investment management capabilities, distribution channels, geographic areas and market exposures, and competitive pricing. Through our focus on these areas, we seek to deliver better outcomes for clients, generate competitive investment results and positive net flows, and increase AUM and revenues.\nWe measure relative investment performance by comparing our investment capabilities to competitors' products, industry benchmarks and client investment objectives. Generally, distributors, investment advisors and consultants take into consideration longer-term investment performance (e.g., three-year and five-year performance) in their selection of investment products and recommendations to their clients. Third-party ratings may also influence client investment decisions. We monitor the quality of client service in a variety of ways, including periodic client satisfaction surveys, analysis of response times and redemption rates, competitive benchmarking of services and feedback from investment consultants.\nThe company is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Our common shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “IVZ.” We maintain a website at www.invesco.com/corporate. (Information contained on our website shall not be deemed to be part of, or be incorporated into, this document.)\n4\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nIndustry Trends\nTrends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally:\nIndividuals and Institutions expect personalized outcomes and experience\n•\nDistribution partners are becoming more selective and continuing to maintain fewer relationships and partners, reducing the number of trusted investment managers with whom they work. \n•\nClients and distribution partners are demanding more from investment managers. While performance remains paramount and competitive pricing is essential, best-in class experience and value-added services (including portfolio analytics and consultative solutions) increasingly differentiate managers. \nStructural shifts in client portfolio allocations\n•\nPrivate market allocations continue to increase and become a more meaningful part of retail portfolios, driving industry fee growth as well as innovation and democratization.\n•\nBeta, factor, and index offerings will continue to be core to portfolios in transparent, efficient markets. In this space, clients will demand ease of access and competitive pricing.\n•\nInvestors are selecting active strategies and place a high bar on proven and consistent performance.\n•\nInvestors have been shifting their investment strategies toward passively managed strategies, and we believe this trend will continue.\nLeading asset managers must quickly curate options that solve clients’ problems\n•\nInvestment capabilities will be delivered efficiently and seamlessly using technologies, platforms, and vehicles.\n•\nInvestment managers are finding new ways of leveraging data and analytics to create insights that will provide strategic advantage and drive investment, distribution, and operational excellence.\n•\nWinners will invest in talent and skills across new ecosystems, requiring new ways of working and strategic partnerships to drive synergies and scale.\nThese dynamics are driving fundamental changes within the industry and, we believe, will drive increasing consolidation. Additionally, the U.S. and China will continue to be the dominant global wealth markets, and global asset management leaders will need a considerable footprint in these markets. We believe the depth and breadth of Invesco's platform position us to understand, anticipate, and meet our clients' needs, successfully competing within our industry over the long term.\nStrategy \nAt Invesco, we seek to drive sustainable profitable growth by delivering capabilities that build enduring relationships and create better outcomes for our clients. We have an advantageous position globally as a diversified, client-centric asset manager and a strategy to deliver for our shareholders. The firm's strategic priorities are aligned with four key long-term themes that are designed to sharpen our focus on clients' needs, further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our long-term success:\nDeliver the excellence our clients expect   \n \n•\nAchieve strong, long-term investment performance.\n•\nDeliver a quality investment process and a frictionless experience with superior engagement.\n•\nProvide a holistic value proposition including advice and solutions to help our clients best manage their portfolios and succeed with their own clients.\nGrow high demand investment offerings \n•\nPrioritize the intersection of market size, secular change, and Invesco’s unique position to drive growth in the highest opportunity regions.\n•\nGrow high demand private markets capabilities leveraging our strong retail channel and expanding investment strategies.\n•\nDrive profitable organic growth, emphasizing high demand, scalable investment capabilities, and delivery vehicles.\nCreate an environment where talented people thrive\n•\nAttract and develop high performing, diverse talent with skills aligned to deliver against business outcomes.\n•\nCreate an inclusive and engaging culture that values diversity of thought which enables us to work as one team to deliver better outcomes.\n5\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nAct like owners for all stakeholders\n \n•\nEmbed next generation technology across all aspects of the business\n•\nStrengthen financial flexibility emphasizing operating leverage\nAs an integrated global investment manager, we are keenly focused on meeting clients' needs and operating effectively and efficiently. We take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under one operating segment, “investment management.”\nA key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain well-performing investment capabilities. We believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm.\nInvestment Management Capabilities\nWe believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their well-defined investment disciplines and risk management approaches provide us with a robust competitive advantage. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. Our asset classes, broadly defined, include equity, fixed income, balanced, alternatives and money market. \nDistribution Channels\nRetail AUM typically originate from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units. Institutional AUM originate from entities such as individual corporate clients, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities or charities. AUM disclosed as retail AUM include AUM distributed by the company's retail sales teams. AUM disclosed as institutional AUM include AUM distributed by the company's institutional sales teams.\nThe company operates as an integrated global investment manager. Dedicated sales forces deliver our investment strategies through a variety of vehicles that meet the needs of retail and institutional clients. Note that not all products sold in the retail distribution channel are in \"retail\" vehicles, and not all products sold in the institutional channel are in \"institutional\" vehicles, as described in the table below. This aggregation, however, is viewed as a proxy for presenting AUM in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate.\nThe following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel:\n                      \nRetail\n             \nInstitutional\n● Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)\n● Collective Trust Funds\n● Closed-end Mutual Funds\n● ETFs\n● Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)\n● Institutional Separate Accounts\n● Individual Savings Accounts\n● Open-end Mutual Funds\n● Investment Companies with Variable Capital (ICVC)\n● Private Funds\n● Investment Trusts\n● Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT)\n● Open-end Mutual Funds\n● Private Funds\n● Separately Managed Accounts (SMA)\n● Société d'investissement à Capital Variable (SICAV)\n● Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)\n● Variable Insurance Funds\n6\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nRetail\nRetail AUM were $1,265.6 billion at December 31, 2024. We offer retail products within all of the major asset classes. Our retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial intermediaries, including major wire houses, direct wealth platforms, regional broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks and financial planners in the Americas, and independent brokers and financial advisors, banks and direct wealth platforms in EMEA and APAC.\nThe Americas and EMEA retail operations rank among the largest by AUM in their respective markets. As of December 31, 2024, Invesco's U.S. retail business, including our ETFs franchise, is among the leading asset managers in the U.S., and Invesco's retail business in EMEA is among the largest non-proprietary investment managers in the retail channel. In addition, Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (IGW or Invesco Great Wall), our joint venture in China, is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with total AUM of approximately $93.2 billion at December 31, 2024. We provide our retail clients with one of the industry's most robust and comprehensive product lines.\nInstitutional\nInstitutional AUM were $580.4 billion at December 31, 2024. We offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies, including traditional and quantitative equities, fixed income (including money market funds for institutional clients), real estate, financial structures and absolute return strategies. Regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world. We have a diversified client base that includes major public and private entities, unions, non-profit organizations, endowments, foundations, pension funds, financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds. Invesco's institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions, government entities and companies in the world.\nAUM Diversification\nOne of Invesco's competitive strengths is the diversification of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and investment capability. We serve clients in more than 120 countries. The following tables present a breakdown of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and investment capability as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the fourth table below illustrates the split of our AUM as Passive and Active. Passive AUM include index-based ETFs, UITs, non-management fee earning AUM and other passive mandates. Active AUM are total AUM less Passive AUM. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM for the year ended December 31, 2024 in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Assets Under Management” for additional information regarding changes in AUM.\nBy Client Domicile\n(in billions)\nTotal\n1-Yr Change\nc\n \nAmericas\n$\n1,315.5 \n16.0 \n%\nc\n \nEMEA\n260.3 \n20.6 \n%\nc\n \nAPAC\n270.2 \n14.7 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,846.0 \n7\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nBy Distribution Channel\n(in billions)\nTotal\n1-Yr Change\nc\n \nRetail\n$\n1,265.6 \n21.5 \n%\nc\n \nInstitutional\n580.4 \n6.8 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,846.0 \nBy Investment Capability\n(in billions)\nTotal\n1-Yr Change\nc\n \nETFs and Index\n$\n484.0 \n33.7 \n%\nc\n \nFundamental Fixed Income\n281.1 \n3.1 \n%\nc\n \nFundamental Equities\n266.5 \n2.3 \n%\nc\n \nPrivate Markets\n128.5 \n(0.9)\n%\nc\n \nAPAC Managed\n118.8 \n10.0 \n%\nc\n \nMulti-Asset/Other\n58.8 \n2.4 \n%\nc\n \nGlobal Liquidity\n189.4 \n14.8 \n%\nc\n \nQQQ\n318.9 \n38.7 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,846.0 \nActive vs. Passive\n(in billions)\nTotal\n1-Yr Change\nc\n \nActive\n$\n1,026.5 \n4.2 \n%\nc\n \nPassive\n819.5 \n36.6 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,846.0 \nCorporate Responsibility and Human Capital\nInvesco’s long-term success depends on our ability to retain, develop, engage and attract top talent. Invesco invests significantly in talent development, health and welfare programs, technology and other resources that support our employees in developing their full potential both personally and professionally. We believe that an employee community that is diverse and inclusive, engaged in community involvement and invested in employee well-being will drive positive outcomes for our clients and shareholders. \n8\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nAs of December 31, 2024, the company had 8,508 (December 31, 2023: \n8,489\n) employees with an on-the-ground presence in over 20 countries. Our employees are not covered under collective bargaining agreements.\nThe company is committed to reducing our impact on the environment. Across Invesco offices, we carefully manage our operational activities with a focus on using natural resources wisely, increasing efficiencies wherever possible and providing a safe and healthy workplace for employees and visitors. This is the foundation of our environmental, health and safety management approach.\nCompetition \nThe investment management business is highly competitive, with points of differentiation including investment performance, fees, range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service. We compete with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and, increasingly, firms outside the traditional financial services industry, such as technology providers. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and higher brand recognition than Invesco. However, we believe our experience as a trusted partner to clients, the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities, product types and channels of distribution, and our commitment to innovation enable us to compete effectively in the global investment management business. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. We also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage, as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute and/or service those products. Lastly, we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our long-term competitive position.\nManagement Contracts\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts. Fees vary with the type of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and with lower fees earned on fixed income, money market and stable value accounts, and ETFs. Investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days' notice. Typically, retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice and institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with investment managers or reduce the aggregate amount of AUM with very short notice periods.\nRisk Management\nInvesco is committed to continually strengthening and evolving our risk management approach and activities to ensure they keep pace with business change and client expectations. We believe a key factor in our ability to manage through challenging market conditions and significant business change is our integrated and global approach to risk management. We seek to embed risk management in our day-to-day decision-making as well as our strategic planning process, while our global risk management framework seeks to enable consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across the company.\nOur framework leverages two governance structures: (i) our Global Investment Risk and Performance Committee oversees the management of core investment risks; and (ii) our Enterprise Risk Management Committee oversees the management of all other business- and strategy-related risks. A network of regional, business unit and risk-specific management committees, with oversight by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, provides ongoing identification, assessment, management, monitoring, and reporting of existing and emerging risks across all domains of our business.\nAvailable Information \nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers at www.sec.gov. We make available free of charge on our website, www.invesco.com/corporate, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statement and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.\n9\nTable of Contents",

Higher operating revenues along with expense discipline contributed to an increase in operating income from the prior year. See additional discussion in the \"Results of Operations\" section.\nWe also remain highly focused on our capital priorities, investing in our key capabilities, efficiently allocating resources, and simplifying and streamlining the organization to position the company for greater scale, performance and improved profitability. We are delivering on our commitment to improve our leverage profile and maintain a strong balance sheet. We redeemed our $600 million senior notes, that were due on January 30, 2024, and we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion and a zero balance on our revolving credit facility. We believe the progress we have made to build financial flexibility has Invesco well-positioned to navigate various market conditions and deliver long-term growth. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of share repurchases and modestly increasing \n30\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \ndividends. During the year, the company repurchased 2.9 million common shares for $49.6 million in the open market, and we expect to continue common share repurchases on a regular basis going forward. \nPresentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of Consolidated Investment Products (CIP)\nThe company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, investment products sponsored by the company in the normal course of business. The company's investment adviser subsidiaries serve as investment managers to these products, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. The company is required to consolidate certain of these managed funds from time-to-time, as discussed more fully in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, \"Accounting Policies -- Basis of Accounting and Consolidation.\" Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Report as CIP. The company's economic risk with respect to each investment in CIP is limited to its equity ownership, unfunded equity commitments and any uncollected management and performance fees. \nThe majority of the company's CIP balances are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider these assets to be company assets. Likewise, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.\nDue to the significant impact that CIP has on the presentation of the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures (among other adjustments). See \"Schedule of Non-GAAP Information\" for additional information regarding these adjustments. The following discussion therefore combines the results presented under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) with the company’s non-GAAP presentation.  \nTo assess the impact of CIP on the company's Results of Operations and Balance Sheet Discussion, refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18, \"Consolidated Investment Products.\"\n31\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nSummary Operating Information\nWherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.

Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision.\nAUM measured in the one, three and five year quartile rankings represents 37%, 37% and 37% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one, three and five year basis represents 48%, 47%, and 45% of total Invesco AUM as of 12/31/2024. Peer group ranking are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund’s market (Morningstar, IA, Lipper, eVestment, Mercer, Galaxy, SITCA, Value Research) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and prior month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings are calculated against all funds in each peer group. Rankings for the primary share class of the most representative fund in each composite are applied to all products within each composite. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor’s experience.\n Assets Under Management\nThe following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM include index-based ETFs, UITs, non-management fee earning AUM and other passive mandates. Active AUM are Total AUM less Passive AUM.\nNon-management fee earning AUM includes non-management fee earning ETFs, UITs and product leverage. The net flows in non-management fee earning AUM can be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these net flows can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield.\nThe AUM tables and the discussion below refer to certain AUM as long-term. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds. Long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital upon maturity. We present net flows into money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and the flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements.\n33\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nChanges in Active and Passive AUM were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in billions)\nTotal AUM\nActive\nPassive\nTotal AUM\nActive\nPassive\nTotal AUM\nActive\nPassive\nBeginning Assets (January 1)\n$\n1,585.3 \n$\n985.3 \n$\n600.0 \n$\n1,409.2 \n$\n976.2 \n$\n433.0 \n$\n1,610.9 \n$\n1,082.5 \n$\n528.4 \nLong-term inflows\n419.0 \n194.0 \n225.0 \n299.1 \n164.3 \n134.8 \n330.3 \n197.9 \n132.4 \nLong-term outflows\n(353.9)\n(209.4)\n(144.5)\n(288.9)\n(193.3)\n(95.6)\n(330.8)\n(226.2)\n(104.6)\nNet long-term flows\n65.1 \n(15.4)\n80.5 \n10.2 \n(29.0)\n39.2 \n(0.5)\n(28.3)\n27.8 \nNet flows in non-management fee earning AUM\n29.8 \n— \n29.8 \n6.2 \n— \n6.2 \n(3.2)\n— \n(3.2)\nNet flows in money market funds\n23.4 \n23.4 \n— \n(11.1)\n(11.1)\n— \n56.4 \n56.4 \n— \nTotal net flows\n118.3 \n8.0 \n110.3 \n5.3 \n(40.1)\n45.4 \n52.7 \n28.1 \n24.6 \nReinvested distributions\n16.0 \n16.0 \n— \n11.5 \n11.5\n— \n15.2 \n15.2 \n— \nMarket gains and losses\n142.7 \n30.0 \n112.7 \n161.1 \n40.0 \n121.1 \n(243.5)\n(125.6)\n(117.9)\nDispositions\n— \n— \n— \n(1.4)\n(1.4)\n— \n— \n— \n— \nForeign currency translation\n(16.3)\n(12.8)\n(3.5)\n(0.4)\n(0.9)\n0.5 \n(26.1)\n(24.0)\n(2.1)\nEnding Assets (December 31)\n$\n1,846.0 \n$\n1,026.5 \n$\n819.5 \n$\n1,585.3 \n$\n985.3 \n$\n600.0 \n$\n1,409.2 \n$\n976.2 \n$\n433.0 \nAverage AUM\nAverage long-term AUM\n$\n1,233.0 \n$\n808.1 \n$\n424.9 \n$\n1,091.3 \n$\n780.4 \n$\n310.9 \n$\n1,104.8 \n$\n820.8 \n$\n284.0 \nAverage AUM\n$\n1,712.2 \n$\n1,001.9 \n$\n710.3 \n$\n1,500.6 \n$\n992.3 \n$\n508.3 \n$\n1,452.5 \n$\n988.2 \n$\n464.3 \nAverage QQQ AUM\n$\n275.8 \n$\n— \n$\n275.8 \n$\n187.5 \n$\n— \n$\n187.5 \n$\n169.1 \n$\n— \n$\n169.1 \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenue yield (bps) \n(1)\nU.S. GAAP gross revenue yield\n37.4\n40.4\n44.5\nNet revenue yield ex performance fees ex QQQ \n(2)\n30.2\n32.4\n35.5\nActive net revenue yield ex performance fees\n36.9\n37.7\n40.7\nPassive net revenue yield ex QQQ  \n(2)\n14.9\n16.0\n18.1\n____________\n(1)    U.S. GAAP g\nross revenue yield on AUM is equal to U.S. GAAP annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding \nIGW\n A\nUM. \nThe average AUM for IGW was\n $88.6 billion \nin 2024 (2023: $87.2 billion, 2022: $93.5 billion).\n \nIt\n \nis appropriate to exclude the average AUM of IGW as the revenues resulting from these AUM are not pr\nesented in our U.S. GAAP operating revenues. Additionally, th\ne U.S. GAAP gross revenue yield is not a good measure because\n the numerator excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Net revenue yield metrics include the net revenues and average AUM of IGW and CIP. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.\n(2)    Performance fees are earned when certain performance metrics are achieved;\n \nInvesco QQQ Trust\n does\n not earn net revenues. Therefore, net revenue yield is calculated excluding performance fees and Invesco QQQ Trust AUM. Passive net revenue yield is calculated excluding Invesco QQQ Trust AUM.\nFlows\nThere are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients, and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. \n34\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nMarket Returns\nMarket gains and losses include the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period.

Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net inflows (or outflows), and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. See the company’s disclosures regarding the changes in AUM during the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n and \nDecember 31, 2023 \nin the “Assets Under Management” section above for additional information.\nAverage AUM were $1,712.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1,500.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. As secular shifts in client demand continue, our broad set of investment capabilities have allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences, including products that have lower net revenue yields. Due to this change in the mix of AUM, net revenue yield excluding performance fees and Invesco QQQ Trust declined to 30.2 basis points (bps) for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 32.4 bps for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n In addition, as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to the mix of AUM between geographies and exchange rates have an impact on operating revenues and net revenue yields.\n \nInvestment Management Fees\nInvestment management fees were $4,342.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $4,106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of higher average AUM partially offset by the shift in AUM toward lower yield products. See discussion above on how AUM changes impact our Investment management fees.\n42\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nService and Distribution Fees\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, Service and distribution fees were $1,479.7 million as compared to $1,374.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher distribution fees of $91.2 million and administrative fees of $12.9 million resulting from higher average AUM to which the fees apply.\nPerformance Fees\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, Performance fees were $46.4 million as compared to $46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Performance fees for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were primarily generated from multi-asset/other, private markets real estate and fundamental equities products. \nOther Revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, Other revenues were $198.6 million as compared to $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Other revenues was primarily driven by higher front end fees of $10.0 million and real estate transaction fees of $4.1 million, partially offset by lower other transaction fees of $4.6 million.\nInvesco Great Wall\nThe company’s most significant joint venture is our investment in IGW. The company reflects 100% of IGW's results in its Net revenues and Adjusted operating expenses because it is important to evaluate the contribution that IGW is making to the business. The company’s non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues.\nNet revenues from IGW were $318.1 million and average AUM was $88.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Net revenues were \n$368.3 million\n and average AUM was $87.2 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2023). The decrease in IGW revenues was primarily driven by the shift in AUM toward lower yield products and the introduction of regulatory mandated fee reductions in China in August 2023. \nCIP\nManagement believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating Net revenues. As Management and Performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these Operating revenues back in the calculation of Net revenues. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues.\nManagement and Performance fees earned from CIP were $41.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to \n$51.2 million\n for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n43\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nOperating Expenses\nThe main categories of operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows: \nYears ended December 31,\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\n$\n2,025.6 \n$\n1,825.2 \n$\n1,886.2 \n$\n200.4 \n11.0 \n%\n$\n(61.0)\n(3.2)\n%\nEmployee compensation\n2,014.2 \n1,885.8 \n1,725.1 \n128.4 \n6.8 \n%\n160.7 \n9.3 \n%\nMarketing \n(1)\n81.3 \n82.1 \n94.6 \n(0.8)\n(1.0)\n%\n(12.5)\n(13.2)\n%\nProperty, office and technology \n(1)\n474.3 \n450.1 \n446.7 \n24.2 \n5.4 \n%\n3.4 \n0.8 \n%\nGeneral and administrative \n(1)\n594.7 \n567.6 \n493.6 \n27.1 \n4.8 \n%\n74.0 \n15.0 \n%\nTransaction, integration and restructuring \n(2)\n— \n41.6 \n21.2 \n(41.6)\nN/A\n20.4 \n96.2 \n%\nAmortization and impairment of intangibles\n44.8 \n1,298.8 \n63.8 \n(1,254.0)\n(96.6)\n%\n1,235.0 \n1,935.7 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n5,234.9 \n$\n6,151.2 \n$\n4,731.2 \n$\n(916.3)\n(14.9)\n%\n$\n1,420.0 \n30.0 \n%\nThe table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total Operating expenses and Operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense.\n(in millions)\n2024\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Operating Revenues\n2023\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Operating Revenues\n2022\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Operating Revenues\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\n$\n2,025.6 \n38.7 \n%\n33.4 \n%\n$\n1,825.2 \n29.7 \n%\n31.9 \n%\n$\n1,886.2 \n39.9 \n%\n31.2 \n%\nEmployee compensation\n2,014.2 \n38.5 \n%\n33.2 \n%\n1,885.8 \n30.7 \n%\n33.0 \n%\n1,725.1 \n36.5 \n%\n28.5 \n%\nMarketing \n(1)\n81.3 \n1.5 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n82.1 \n1.3 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n94.6 \n2.1 \n%\n1.5 \n%\nProperty, office and technology \n(1)\n474.3 \n9.1 \n%\n7.8 \n%\n450.1 \n7.3 \n%\n7.9 \n%\n446.7 \n9.4 \n%\n7.4 \n%\nGeneral and administrative \n(1)\n594.7 \n11.4 \n%\n9.8 \n%\n567.6 \n9.2 \n%\n9.9 \n%\n493.6 \n10.4 \n%\n8.1 \n%\nTransaction, integration and restructuring \n(2)\n— \n— \n%\n— \n%\n41.6 \n0.7 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n21.2 \n0.4 \n%\n0.4 \n%\nAmortization and impairment of intangibles\n44.8 \n0.8 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n1,298.8 \n21.1 \n%\n22.7 \n%\n63.8 \n1.3 \n%\n1.1 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n5,234.9 \n100.0 \n%\n86.3 \n%\n$\n6,151.2 \n100.0 \n%\n107.6 \n%\n$\n4,731.2 \n100.0 \n%\n78.2 \n%\n__________\n(\n1)    Comparative periods presented reflect reclassification of certain operating expenses to align with current period presentation. The reclassification had no impact on our reported Operating revenues, Operating income, Net income, or any internal performance measure on which management is compensated. See Note \n1\n, \"Accounting Policies,\" for additional information.\n(2)    Transaction, integration and restructuring charges were primarily restructuring costs relating to our strategic evaluation which we completed in the first quarter of 2023.\nOperating expenses decreased $916.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The year ended December 31, 2023 included a $1,248.9 million non-cash impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets related to prior acquisitions of management contracts of U.S. retail mutual funds. The year ended December 31, 2024 included a one-time acceleration of $147.6 million in Employee compensation expense resulting from changes to the retirement criteria for vesting of currently outstanding common share-based awards and other long-term awards (collectively, Long-term awards). Excluding the intangible asset impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the acceleration of Employee compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $185.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \n44\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nThird-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory \nThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic “renewal” commissions which are paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for providing services to their client accounts while they are invested in an Invesco product. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value and apply to much of the company's non-U.S. retail operations. The revenues from the company’s U.S. retail operations include 12b-1 distribution fees, which are largely passed through to brokers who sell the funds as third-party distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs. Both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying AUM of the brokers' clients. The upfront distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client common share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. These costs are reimbursed by the related funds.\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses were $2,025.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1,825.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $112.9 million in service costs and $86.3 million in administrative and other third-party management fees resulting from higher average AUM and fund related costs. See \"Schedule of Non-GAAP Information\" for additional disclosures.\nEmployee Compensation\nEmployee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and long-term incentive plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in Employee compensation. \nEmployee compensation was $2,014.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1,885.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the previously noted acceleration of expense for currently outstanding Long-term awards of $147.6 million, higher variable compensation costs of $47.5 million and an increase of $29.2 million in expense related to the mark-to-market on deferred compensation liabilities. The increase was partially offset by lower costs related to executive retirements and organizational changes of $82.5 million.\nHeadcount at December 31, 2024 was 8,508 (December 31, 2023; 8,489).\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company's products through conferences or other sponsorships.\nMarketing expenses were $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nProperty, Office and Technology\nProperty, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property, equipment and software, and other technology expenses including maintenance and licensing fees.\nProperty, office and technology expenses were $474.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to       $450.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher software costs of $21.2 million.\nGeneral and Administrative \nGeneral and administrative expenses include information service subscriptions, irrecoverable indirect taxes, employee travel, professional fees, recruitment and training costs as well as costs for outsourced services such as technology, middle office and back office management services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $594.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $567.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $52.5 million expense related to the settlement of regulatory matters partially offset by lower professional fees of $28.1 million.\n45\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The year ended December 31, 2023 included a $1,248.9 million non-cash impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets related to management contracts of U.S. retail mutual funds.\nOperating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\nOperating income was $832.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to an operating loss of $434.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) increased to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from (7.6)% in the year ended December 31, 2023. The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the $1,248.9 million intangible asset impairment as discussed above. \nAdjusted operating income increased to $1,370.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $1,213.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted operating margin increased to 31.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of Operating revenues to Net revenues, a reconciliation of Operating income to Adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding Net revenues, Adjusted operating income and Adjusted operating margin.\nOther Income and Expenses\nThe main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: \nYears ended December 31,\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n43.0 \n$\n71.3 \n$\n106.1 \n$\n(28.3)\n(39.7)\n%\n$\n(34.8)\n(32.8)\n%\nInterest and dividend income\n58.9 \n47.8 \n24.4 \n11.1 \n23.2 \n%\n23.4 \n95.9 \n%\nInterest expense\n(58.0)\n(70.5)\n(85.2)\n12.5 \n(17.7)\n%\n14.7 \n(17.3)\n%\nOther gains and losses, net\n47.7 \n98.0 \n(139.5)\n(50.3)\n(51.3)\n%\n237.5 \nN/A\nOther income/(expense) of CIP, net\n81.6 \n50.3 \n24.2 \n31.3 \n62.2 \n%\n26.1 \n107.9 \n%\nTotal other income and expenses\n$\n173.2 \n$\n196.9 \n$\n(70.0)\n$\n(23.7)\n(12.0)\n%\n$\n266.9 \nN/A\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in income of $13.5 million from our joint venture investment in IGW and $9.6 million from our private markets real estate investments.\nInterest and dividend income\nInterest and dividend income was $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in dividend income earned on our private markets, deferred compensation and seed capital investments and higher interest income earned from Cash and cash equivalents. \nInterest expense \nInterest expense was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of the decrease in outstanding debt.\nOther gains and losses, net \nOther gains and losses, net was a gain of $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to a net gain of $98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net gains for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 included net market gains on deferred compensation related investments, other hedging instruments, and seed capital investments. The net gain for the year ended December 31, 2023 also included a $45 million gain on the sale of certain Hong Kong pension sponsorship rights. \n46\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nOther income/(expense) of CIP, net\nOther income/(expense) of CIP, net includes interest and dividend income, interest expense, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt owned by CIP. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net interest income of CIP was $139.5 million as compared to $226.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily a result of newly consolidated investment products in the year ended December 31, 2023 which were deconsolidated in the year ended December 31, 2024 as well as lower net interest income earned by the CLOs. For the year ended December 31, 2024, other gains and losses of CIP were a net loss of $57.9 million as compared to a net loss of $176.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net losses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were attributable to market-driven losses on investments held by consolidated funds.\nNet impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities\nThe adjustment to Net income for the Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities removes the income/(expense) of CIP which is attributable to third-party investors. Therefore, the consolidation of investment products did not have an impact on Net income attributable to Invesco for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Also, the net income or loss of CIP is taxed at the investor level, not at the product level; therefore, a tax provision is not reflected in the net impact of CIP.\nIncome Tax Expense \nThe income tax provision was an expense of $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a benefit of  $(69.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of 25.2%  and 29.3% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily a result of favorable permanent tax adjustments increasing the effective tax due to the pre-tax book loss in 2023. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was unfavorably impacted by nondeductible regulatory settlements and an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against certain net operating losses. For additional income tax information, please refer to Note 14, “Taxation,” in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n47\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nSchedule of Non-GAAP Information\nWe utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: Net revenue (and by calculation, Net revenue yield on AUM), Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco and Adjusted diluted EPS. The company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company’s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. These measures also assist the company’s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are Operating revenues (and by calculation, Gross revenue yield on AUM), Operating income, Operating margin, Net income/(loss) attributable to Invesco and Diluted EPS. Each of these measures is discussed more fully below.\nThe following are reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to the non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates.

The Net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the company, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco’s own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates Net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to Net revenues divided by Average AUM during the reporting period, as an indicator of the Net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage.\nInvestment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees. Service and distributions fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fund-related costs. Other revenues are primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties.\n(2)  Invesco Great Wall: The company reflects 100% of IGW in its Net revenues and Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin\n)\n. The company’s non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earning attributable to the noncontrolling interests.\n(3)  CIP: See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18, “Consolidated Investment Products,” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of CIP. The company believes that the CIP may impact a reader’s analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust Operating revenues and Operating income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective Net revenues and Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin).\n(4)  Transaction, integration and restructuring: The company believes it is useful to adjust for the Transaction, integration and restructuring charges in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and restructuring related charges. Transaction, integration and restructuring charges were primarily restructuring costs relating to our strategic evaluation which we completed in the first quarter of 2023.\n(5)  Amortization and impairment of intangible assets: The company removes amortization and non-cash impairment expense related to acquired assets in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition-related charges.\n(6)  Market valuation changes related to deferred compensation plan liabilities: Certain deferred compensation plan awards provide a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments. The company economically hedges the exposure to market movements on these deferred compensation liabilities. Since these liabilities are economically hedged, the company believes it is useful to  remove the market movements related to the deferred compensation plan liabilities from the calculation of Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin) and to remove the net impact of the economic hedge from the calculation of Adjusted net income (and by calculation, Adjusted diluted EPS) to produce results that will be more comparable period to period.\n49\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \n(7)  One-time acceleration of compensation expense for currently outstanding Long-term awards: In the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded a one-time non-cash acceleration of Compensation expense of $147.6 million resulting from changes to the retirement criteria for vesting of currently outstanding Long-term awards. Due to the non-recurring nature of this item, the company removed this expense in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS as this will aid comparability of our results period to period. \n(8)  General and administrative: In 2024, the company removed the expense related to the settlement of regulatory matters. In 2023 and 2022, the company removed insurance recoveries related to fund-related losses incurred in prior periods. Due to the non-recurring nature of these items, the company removed these expenses in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted EPS as this will aid comparability of our results period to period. \n(9)  Operating margin is equal to Operating income divided by Operating revenues.\n(10)  Adjusted operating margin is equal to Adjusted operating income divided by Net revenues.\n(11)  Tax adjustment for amortization of intangible assets and goodwill: The company reflects the tax benefit realized on the tax amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in Adjusted net income. The company believes it is useful to include this tax benefit in arriving at the Adjusted diluted EPS measure.\n(12)  Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted common shares outstanding.\n50\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nBalance Sheet Discussion \n(1)\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of the balance sheet information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis to the balance sheet information excluding the impact of CIP for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nBalance sheet information\n(in millions)\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nExcluding CIP\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nExcluding CIP\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n986.5 \n$\n— \n$\n986.5 \n$\n1,469.2 \n$\n— \n$\n1,469.2 \nInvestments\n1,240.0 \n401.4 \n1,641.4 \n919.1 \n527.4 \n1,446.5 \nGoodwill and intangible assets, net\n14,067.4 \n— \n14,067.4 \n14,539.6 \n— \n14,539.6 \nOther assets \n(2)\n2,340.5 \n11.1 \n2,351.6 \n2,527.5 \n18.8 \n2,546.3 \nInvestments and other assets of CIP\n (3)\n8,374.5 \n(8,374.5)\n— \n9,478.4 \n(9,478.4)\n— \nTotal assets\n$\n27,008.9 \n$\n(7,962.0)\n$\n19,046.9 \n$\n28,933.8 \n$\n(8,932.2)\n$\n20,001.6 \nLIABILITIES\nDebt\n$\n890.6 \n$\n— \n$\n890.6 \n$\n1,489.5 \n$\n— \n$\n1,489.5 \nOther liabilities \n(4)\n3,596.4 \n— \n3,596.4 \n3,914.4 \n— \n3,914.4 \nDebt and other liabilities of CIP\n6,853.1 \n(6,853.1)\n— \n7,613.9 \n(7,613.9)\n— \nTotal liabilities\n$\n11,340.1 \n$\n(6,853.1)\n$\n4,487.0 \n$\n13,017.8 \n$\n(7,613.9)\n$\n5,403.9 \nEQUITY\nTotal equity attributable to Invesco Ltd.\n$\n14,559.9 \n$\n— \n$\n14,559.9 \n$\n14,597.6 \n$\n0.1 \n$\n14,597.7 \nNoncontrolling interests \n(5)\n1,108.9 \n(1,108.9)\n— \n1,318.4 \n(1,318.4)\n— \nTotal equity\n15,668.8 \n(1,108.9)\n14,559.9 \n15,916.0 \n(1,318.3)\n14,597.7 \nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n27,008.9 \n$\n(7,962.0)\n$\n19,046.9 \n$\n28,933.8 \n$\n(8,932.2)\n$\n20,001.6 \n ____________\n(1)    This table includes non-GAAP presentations. Assets of CIP are not available for use by Invesco. Additionally, there is no recourse to Invesco for CIP debt. \n(2)    Amounts include Accounts receivable, Property, equipment and software, and Other assets. \n(3)    Amounts include Cash and cash equivalents of CIP. \n(4)    Amounts include Accrued compensation and benefits, Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and Deferred tax liabilities.\n(5)    Amounts include Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and Equity attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $482.7 million from $1,469.2 million at December 31, 2023 to $986.5 million at December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the balance on the $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement was zero. \nIn the ordinary course of business, Invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of Invesco. Purchase obligations represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancellable with a penalty. As of December 31, 2024, the company's purchase obligations totaled $694.4 million (December 31, 2023: $663.5 million) and primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's Consolidated Financial Statements when services are provided.\n52\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nCapital Management \nOur capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include, in no particular order of priority: reinvestment in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of share repurchases and modestly increasing dividends. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the company repurchased 2.9 million common shares for $49.6 million in the open market. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $332.6 million remained authorized under the company’s common share repurchase authorization approved by the Board on July 22, 2016.\nOur capital process is executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain strong, investment grade credit ratings. As of the date of our filing, Invesco held credit ratings of BBB+/Stable, A3/Stable and A/Stable from S&P Ratings Service, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively. \nOther Items\nCertain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, liquidity, and working capital. Such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. These and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. Our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us.\n    We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $324.9 million (December 31, 2023: $395.8 million). \n We meet the regulatory liquidity and working capital requirements by holding cash and cash equivalents in the European sub-group. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group in the countries where it is located. Due to the liquidity and working capital requirements, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences.\nThe consolidation of $8,374.5 million and $6,200.9 million of\n \ntotal assets and debt of CIP as of December 31, 2024, respectively, did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources.  See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18, “Consolidated Investment Products,” for additional details.\n53\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nCash Flows Discussion\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of the cash flow information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis to the cash flow information, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIP for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table:\nYears ended December 31, \nCash flows information \n(1)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nExcluding CIP\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nExcluding CIP\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nExcluding CIP\nCash and cash equivalents beginning of the period\n$\n1,931.6 \n$\n(462.4)\n$\n1,469.2 \n$\n1,434.1 \n$\n(199.4)\n$\n1,234.7 \n$\n2,147.1 \n$\n(250.7)\n$\n1,896.4 \nCash flows from operating activities\n1,190.0 \n(114.8)\n1,075.2 \n1,300.8 \n(136.6)\n1,164.2 \n703.2 \n414.1 \n1,117.3 \nCash flows from investing activities\n68.4 \n(308.4)\n(240.0)\n(244.3)\n72.8 \n(171.5)\n(375.6)\n81.5 \n(294.1)\nCash flows from financing activities\n(1,661.6)\n374.0 \n(1,287.6)\n(585.4)\n(196.8)\n(782.2)\n(966.9)\n(449.4)\n(1,416.3)\nIncrease/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n(403.2)\n(49.2)\n(452.4)\n471.1 \n(260.6)\n210.5 \n(639.3)\n46.2 \n(593.1)\nForeign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents\n(32.4)\n2.1 \n(30.3)\n26.4 \n(2.4)\n24.0 \n(73.7)\n5.1 \n(68.6)\nCash and cash equivalents, end of the period\n$\n1,496.0 \n$\n(509.5)\n$\n986.5 \n$\n1,931.6 \n$\n(462.4)\n$\n1,469.2 \n$\n1,434.1 \n$\n(199.4)\n$\n1,234.7 \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n986.5 \n$\n— \n$\n986.5 \n$\n1,469.2 \n$\n— \n$\n1,469.2 \n$\n1,234.7 \n$\n— \n$\n1,234.7 \nCash and cash equivalents of CIP\n509.5 \n(509.5)\n— \n462.4 \n(462.4)\n— \n199.4 \n(199.4)\n— \nTotal cash and cash equivalents per consolidated statement of cash flows\n$\n1,496.0 \n$\n(509.5)\n$\n986.5 \n$\n1,931.6 \n$\n(462.4)\n$\n1,469.2 \n$\n1,434.1 \n$\n(199.4)\n$\n1,234.7 \n____________\n(1)    These tables include non-GAAP presentations. Cash held by CIP is not available for use by Invesco. Additionally, there is no recourse to Invesco for CIP debt. The cash flows of CIP do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions.\n \nOperating Activities\nOperating cash flows include the receipt of Investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by Operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. After allowing for the change in cash held by CIP, investment activities, non-cash activity, and seasonal payments, such as bonus payments in the first quarter, our operating cash flows generally move in the same direction as our Operating income/(loss). \nCash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2024, excluding the impact of CIP, were primarily driven by operating income and changes in payables and receivables due to the timing of payments and receipts. \nInvesting Activities\nCash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2024, excluding the impact of CIP, includes purchases of investments of $307.0 million (year ended December 31, 2023: $108.2 million) and property, equipment and software of $69.1 million (year ended December 31, 2023: $164.3 million), partially offset by proceeds of $135.9 million from Capital distributions from equity method investees (year ended December 31, 2023: $28.0 million). The year ended December 31, 2023 also included proceeds of $26.8 million from the Sale of investments and $46.2 million from the sale of certain Hong Kong pension sponsorship rights.\nFinancing Activities \nFinancing cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2024 included $371.5 million of common dividend payments for dividends declared in January, April, July and October 2024 (year ended December 31, 2023: dividends paid of $357.9 million), $236.8 million of preferred dividend payments for dividends declared in January, April, July and October 2024 (year ended December 31, 2023: $236.8 million), $49.6 million for the repurchase of common shares through the open market (year ended December 31, 2023: $150.0 million), and the payment of $29.7 million to meet employees' withholding tax obligations on common share vestings (2023: $37.5 million). Financing cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2024 also included a $600.0 million redemption of senior notes. Net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were zero during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n54\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nDividends\nWhen declared, Invesco pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. Holders of our preferred shares are eligible to receive dividends at an annual rate of 5.9%\n \nof the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, or $59 per share per annum. The preferred dividend is payable quarterly on a non-cumulative basis when, if and as declared by our Board. However, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for a particular dividend period, we may not declare or pay dividends on, redeem, purchase or acquire our common stock or other junior securities in the next succeeding dividend period. In addition, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for six quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors of the company will be increased by two and the holders of the preferred shares shall have the right to elect such two additional members of the Board.\nOn January 27, 2025, the company declared a fourth quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.205 per common share to the holders of common shares. The dividend is payable on March 4, 2025, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2025, with an ex-dividend date of February 14, 2025.\nOn January 27, 2025, the company declared a preferred dividend of $14.75 per preferred share representing the period from December 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025. The preferred dividend is payable on March 3, 2025.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The company has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels and historical dividend payouts.\nCommon Share Repurchase Plan \nDuring 2024, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares for $49.6 million in the open market as compared to 9.6 million shares for $150 million during 2023. At December 31, 2024, approximately $332.6 million remained authorized under the company's common share repurchase authorization approved by the Board on July 22, 2016 (December 31, 2023: $382.2 million).\nDebt\nThe carrying value of our debt at December 31, 2024 was $890.6 million (December 31, 2023: $1,489.5 million), See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, “Debt,” for additional disclosures. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the company's weighted average cost of debt was 4.64% (year ended December 31, 2023: 4.28%).\nFinancial covenants under the revolving credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of an Adjusted debt/Earnings before income tax, depreciation, amortization, interest expense, common share-based compensation expense, unrealized (gains)/losses from investments, net, and unusual or otherwise non-recurring gains and losses (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) leverage ratio, as defined in the revolving credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00, (ii) an interest coverage ratio (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA/interest expense for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At December 31, 2024, our leverage ratio was 0.25:1.00 (December 31, 2023: 0.69:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 26.84:1.00 (December 31, 2023: 20.40:1.00).\n55\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nThe \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n coverage ratio calculations are as follows:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Invesco Ltd.\n$\n538.0 \n$\n(333.7)\nDividends on preferred shares\n236.8 \n236.8 \nInterest expense\n58.0 \n70.5 \nTax expense/(benefit)\n252.9 \n(69.7)\nAmortization/depreciation/impairment \n(1)\n184.1 \n1,431.7 \nCommon share-based compensation expense\n71.1 \n114.6 \nOne-time acceleration of compensation expense for currently outstanding Long-term awards \n(2)\n147.6 \n— \nRegulatory matters \n(2)\n52.5 \n— \nUnrealized (gains)/losses from investments, net \n(3)\n16.0 \n(11.9)\nCovenant Adjusted EBITDA \n(4)\n$\n1,557.0 \n$\n1,438.3 \nAdjusted debt \n(4)\n$\n393.8 \n$\n992.4 \nLeverage ratio (Adjusted debt/Covenant Adjusted EBITDA - maximum 3.25:1.00)\n0.25 \n0.69 \nInterest coverage (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA/Interest expense - minimum 4.00:1.00)\n26.84 \n20.40 \n____________\n(1)    Includes amortization of cloud technology implementation costs.  \n(2)    Unusual or otherwise non-recurring gains and losses, as defined in our revolving\n \ncredit agreement, are adjusted for in the determination of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. A one-time acceleration of $147.6 million in expense resulting from changes to the criteria for retirements for currently outstanding Long-term awards and an expense of $52.5 million related to the settlement of regulatory matters in 2024 are non-recurring expenses and have been removed from the determination of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA.\n(3)    Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our revolving credit agreement, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures.\n(4)    Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management in connection with certain debt covenant calculations under our revolving credit agreement. The calculation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA above (a reconciliation from Net income attributable to Invesco\n \nLtd.) is defined by our revolving credit agreement, and therefore Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. The calculation of 2024 Adjusted debt is defined in our amended revolving credit agreement and equals debt of $890.6 million plus $3.2 million in letters of credit less $500.0 million of excess unrestricted cash (cash and cash equivalents less the minimum regulatory capital requirement, not to exceed $500 million (2023: $500.0 million).\nOn January 30, 2024, Invesco Finance PLC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Parent, paid in full the outstanding balance of the $600.0 million senior notes which were due on January 30, 2024. \nThe discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. The Item 1. Business - Risk Management section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management. \nCredit and Liquidity Risk \nThe company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”), through measurement and analysis. \nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. As of December 31, 2024, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our Cash and cash equivalent balances is $986.5 million, of which $479.3 million is invested in affiliated money market funds. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, \"Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\" for information regarding Cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds.\n56\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $890.6 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed revolving credit agreement, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our net income could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. A decline in the value of AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the value of AUM.\nOff Balance Sheet Commitments\nSee Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, “Accounting Policies.\" Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these Consolidated Financial Statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. The discussion below provides information on the significant judgments and assumptions applied in each area and should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies footnote previously referenced.\nIntangible Assets\nManagement has the option to first assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e., the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset). In addition, management's judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense. \nIntangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If a quantitative assessment is required, the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Management used an income approach to value indefinite-lived intangible assets related to acquired management contracts of U.S. retail mutual funds. An income approach includes assumptions for current market conditions, including the asset’s updated forecasts of AUM to take into consideration market gains or losses, net long-term flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. The most sensitive assumptions used in the income approach are the long-term growth rate and the discount rate applied to the cash flow forecast to determine present value. Taking into consideration the AUM mix of the U.S. retail mutual funds, the long-term growth rate was determined using the historical returns of the S&P 500 index, treasury bonds and treasury bills. The long-term growth rate used by management in the annual impairment test was 2.5% and is consistent with the prior year annual impairment test. The discount rate is an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and considers an applicable size premium for the intangible asset. The discount rate used by management was 12.88%, which declined 17 bps from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the risk-free rate. We continued to factor an asset-specific risk premium into the discount rate for the U.S. retail mutual fund indefinite-lived intangible assets to account for the uncertainty around future AUM flows given the continued shift \n57\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nin investor preferences away from actively managed funds. We assessed the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the intangible assets by considering applicable market data.\nBased on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2024, we determined that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to acquired management contracts of U.S. retail mutual funds exceeded its carrying value of $4,572.1 million by $267.4 million or 6%. Headroom increased from the prior year due to favorable market conditions\n \nand a decrease in the discount rate. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts which could drive impairment in future periods. For example, assuming all other assumptions remain static, a decrease to the long-term growth rate of 25 bps would decrease headroom to $178.1 million or 3.9%. Also, an increase to the discount rate of 15 bps would decrease headroom to $206.2 million or 4.5%. \nOur annual impairment reviews of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that there was not an impairment of these intangibles. The classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of definite-lived intangible assets were required.\nGoodwill\nManagement has the option to first assess goodwill for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. We performed a quantitative annual impairment test as of October 1, 2023 and determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 5%. For our annual impairment test in 2024, management performed the optional qualitative approach. Based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of October 1, 2024, we determined that a quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary. The qualitative impairment analysis indicated that headroom improved from the prior year impairment test due to improved profitability, favorable market conditions and a decrease in the discount rate. \nThe company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill of $8,318.1 million at December 31, 2024. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions or a significant decline in our revenue and operating income due to a change in AUM mix or unfavorable market conditions, including a significant decline in our stock price for an extended period of time. However, an impairment in the future would not impact the company’s liquidity or capital resources.\nIncome Taxes\nThe company files U.S. federal, state and numerous foreign income tax returns. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in the determination of our annual income tax provision, which includes the assessment of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, as well as the interpretation and application of existing and newly enacted tax laws, regulation changes and new judicial rulings. Therefore, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements due to changes in the interpretation of applicable guidance or as a result of examinations by taxing authorities.\nDeferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the company considers all available evidence, which includes the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability and the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, among other factors.\nIn the assessment of uncertain tax positions, significant judgment is required to estimate the range of possible outcomes and determine the probability, on a more likely than not basis, of favorable or unfavorable outcomes upon ultimate settlement of an issue. Changes in the estimate of uncertain tax positions occur periodically due to changes in interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by tax authorities and new regulatory or judicial guidance that could impact the relative merits and risk of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially impact results of operations. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense.\n58\nTable of Contents\n    \n                                 \nCIP\nAssessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors assessed as part of the analysis include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. If the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the fund's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund, then the company is deemed to be the fund's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund. Assessing if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the fund’s economic results may involve significant judgment.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, “Accounting Policies - Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements.”",
