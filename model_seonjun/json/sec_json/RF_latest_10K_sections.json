In addition, Regions operates several offices delivering specialty capabilities in New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Salt Lake City, and other locations nationwide. Regions provides financial solutions for a wide range of clients including retail and mortgage banking services, commercial banking services and wealth and investment services. Further, Regions and its subsidiaries deliver other financial services capabilities described below. At December 31, 2024, Regions had total consolidated assets of approximately $157.3 billion, total consolidated deposits of approximately $127.6 billion and total consolidated shareholders’ equity of approximately $17.9 billion.  \nThe terms “Regions,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” as used herein mean collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. Regions' principal executive offices are located at 1900 Fifth Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, and its telephone number at that address is (800) 734-4667.\nBanking Operations\nRegions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2024, Regions operated 2,011 ATMs and 1,253 total branch outlets primarily across the South, Midwest and Texas.\nThe following table reflects the distribution of branch locations in each of the states in which Regions conducts its banking operations.\n \nBranches\nFlorida\n270 \nTennessee\n195 \nAlabama\n185 \nGeorgia\n117 \nMississippi\n98 \nTexas\n86 \nLouisiana\n80 \nArkansas\n55 \nMissouri\n48 \nIllinois\n40 \nIndiana\n40 \nSouth Carolina\n18 \nKentucky\n9 \nNorth Carolina\n6 \nIowa\n5 \nUtah\n1 \nTotal\n1,253 \nOther Financial Services Operations\nIn addition to its banking operations, Regions and its subsidiaries deliver specialty capabilities including merger and acquisition advisory services, capital markets solutions, home improvement lending, investment advisory services, equipment financing for commercial clients and small business customers, low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management, financing to CRA-qualified customers, investment and insurance products, broker-dealer services to commercial clients, and others.\nBusiness Segments\nRegions operates under three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. See \"Note 22 \"Business Segment Information\" in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details on each of Regions reportable segments. \nSupervision and Regulation\nWe are subject to the extensive regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to BHCs and their subsidiaries. This framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC’s DIF and the banking system as a whole and is not intended for the protection of shareholders or other investors. \n9\nTable of Contents\n \nBanking and other financial services statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to Regions and its subsidiaries. Regions cannot predict future changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory agency policies, including any changes resulting from changes in the U.S. presidential administration and U.S. Congress. Yet, such changes may have a material impact on Regions’ business, financial condition or results of operations. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others.\nThe scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which Regions is subject have increased in recent years, initially in response to the financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors, including the failure of  U.S. depository institutions in the first half of 2023, technological factors, market changes, climate change concerns, as well as increased scrutiny and possible denials of bank mergers and acquisitions by federal banking regulators. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Regions expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nThe descriptions below summarize certain significant federal and state laws to which Regions is subject. These descriptions do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOverview \nAs a BHC, Regions is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve. Regions has elected to be treated as an FHC which allows it to engage in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permissible for a BHC. The BHC Act provides for “umbrella” regulation of FHCs by the Federal Reserve and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. The BHC Act also requires the Federal Reserve to examine any subsidiary of a BHC, other than a depository institution, engaged in activities permissible for a depository institution. The Federal Reserve is also granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of, examine and adopt rules applicable to any holding company subsidiary.\nRegions Bank is an Alabama state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Its operations are generally subject to supervision and examination by both the Federal Reserve and the Alabama State Banking Department. Regions Bank is also affected by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it implements monetary policy. As a Federal Reserve System member bank, Regions Bank is required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in an amount equal to six percent of its capital stock and surplus. Member banks with total assets in excess of $10 billion, including Regions Bank, receive a floating rate dividend tied to 10-year U.S. Treasuries, with the maximum dividend rate capped at six percent.\nRegions Bank and its affiliates that provide consumer financial products and services are also subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. \nRegions and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in derivatives transactions, securities underwriting, market making, brokerage, investment advisory and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other federal and state regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, CFTC, FINRA and the NYSE. Regions Bank is also subject to additional state and federal laws, as well as various compliance regulations, that govern its activities, the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower.\nExaminations by Regions’ regulators consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory policies of the agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, the ability and performance of management and the Board, the effectiveness of internal controls, earnings, liquidity, interest rate risk management and various other factors. Following those examinations, Regions and Regions Bank are assigned supervisory ratings. This supervisory framework, including the examination reports and supervisory ratings, which are considered confidential supervisory information, could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of Regions’ operations.\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s Large Financial Institution Rating System, component ratings are assigned for capital planning, liquidity risk management, and governance and controls. To be considered “well managed” under this rating system, a firm must be rated “broadly meets expectations” or “conditionally meets expectations” for each of its three component ratings.\nThe results of examinations by any of Regions’ federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on Regions’ activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad enforcement authority and discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and non-monetary requirements against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice.\n10\nTable of Contents\n \nPermissible Activities under the BHC Act \nThe BHC Act limits the activities permissible for BHCs to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incidental thereto. A BHC electing to be treated as a FHC, like Regions, may also engage in a range of activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally. These activities include securities dealing, underwriting and market making, insurance underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments.\nThe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a BHC electing to be treated as an FHC. Furthermore, if the Federal Reserve determines that an FHC has not maintained a CRA rating of at least “satisfactory,” the FHC would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although the FHC would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities.\nThe Federal Reserve has the power to order any BHC or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the BHC.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory Tailoring Rules\nAs a BHC with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets, we are subject to enhanced prudential standards and capital rules  (the “Tailoring Rules”). The Tailoring Rules assign each U.S. BHC with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well as its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and five other risk-based indicators: (1) cross-jurisdictional activity, (2) wSTWF, (3) non-bank assets, (4) off-balance sheet exposure and (5) status as a U.S. G-SIB. \nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Regions and Regions Bank are each subject to Category IV standards, which apply to banking organizations with at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for Categories I through III. Firms subject to Category IV standards are generally subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as firms with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, but are, among other things, subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and also required to monitor and report certain risk-based indicators. Accordingly, under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms are, among other things, (1) not subject to LCR or NSFR requirements (or, in certain cases, subject to reduced requirements), (2) eligible to opt-out of the requirement to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital, (3) not subject to company-run capital stress testing requirements, (4) subject to supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis, (5) subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and (6) subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements.\nPause on Major Federal Reserve Rulemakings\nIn January 2025, the Federal Reserve stated that Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr would step down from the position, effective February 28, 2025. The Federal Reserve stated that it will not issue any major rulemaking from the time of the announcement until a new vice chair for supervision is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nRegions and Regions Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the Basel III framework.\nThe Basel III Rules, among other things, include both risk-based requirements, which compare three measures of capital to RWAs, as well as leverage requirements, which in the case of Category IV banking organizations such as Regions, consist of the Tier 1 leverage ratio described below.\nThe capital rules also require firms to maintain a buffer (referred to as the SCB) consisting of solely CET1 capital, in addition to the minimum risk-based requirements. Failure to satisfy the buffer requirement in full results in graduated constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and discretionary executive compensation. The extent to which capital distributions will be constrained depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income,” which is defined as the greater of (1) a banking institution’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions to shareholders and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (2) the average of a banking institution’s net income over the preceding four quarters. As a Category IV banking organization, Regions’ SCB is determined through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR supervisory stress tests which include analyses using baseline and severely adverse economic and financial scenarios. Regions’ SCB requirement is determined by adding the Federal Reserve’s modeled capital degradation, in the supervisory severely adverse scenario, plus four quarters of planned common \n11\nTable of Contents\n \nstock dividends. As a Category IV banking organization, the capital degradation component of the SCB is calculated every other year, in even-numbered years. During a year in which a Category IV banking organization does not undergo a supervisory stress test, it will receive an updated SCB requirement that reflects its updated planned common stock dividends. A Category IV banking organization is also able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which it would not normally be subject to the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated SCB requirement. The SCB is subject to a 2.5 percent floor. \nThe Company's results of the 2024 stress test from the Federal Reserve reflect that the Company exceeded all minimum capital levels. The Company's SCB will remain floored at 2.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025.\nSee Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details on minimum capital ratios and those needed to be well capitalized. \nRegions is also subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital.\nAs a Category IV banking organization, Regions must also develop and maintain a capital plan, and must submit the capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process. The CCAR process is intended to help ensure that BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company’s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule relating to the CCAR process provides that a BHC must receive prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan, subject to an exception for distributions on newly issued capital instruments. Among other circumstances, a BHC may be required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with certain acquisitions or dispositions.  \nIn 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies published a final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Regions adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. \nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal to revise the risk-based capital standards applicable to Regions, which generally aligns with the global Basel Accord. The proposal would introduce a new measure of RWAs, which would reflect the proposed new standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, as well as a proposed new measure for market risk that would be based on both internal models and standardized supervisory models of market risk. For Category III and IV institutions, this includes removing the AOCI opt-out in calculating regulatory capital. The proposal, if enacted, would have an effective date of July 1, 2025, with certain elements, such as the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital and changes in risk-weighted assets calculated under the Expanded Risk-Based Approach, having a three-year phase-in period. The proposal has not been finalized. Recent public statements suggest changes to the proposal will ultimately be made before it is finalized. The Company will continue to evaluate this proposal, as well as any potential future changes to the proposal, and the potential impacts on Regions. \nIn August 2023, the U.S. banking regulators proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets to comply with long-term debt requirements and clean holding company requirements that currently apply only to global systemically important banking organizations. This proposal would also impose a long-term debt requirement on certain categories of IDIs, including IDIs with $100 billion or more in total assets, such as Regions Bank. If adopted, this proposal would require the Company and Regions Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. Regions Bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt to the Company, and the Company would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt externally. In addition, if adopted as proposed, the clean holding company requirement would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution, including, for example, prohibiting the Company from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties, as well as limiting the amount of the Company’s liabilities that are not eligible long-term. This proposal was subject to a comment period that closed January 16, 2024. The Company will continue to evaluate this proposal and the potential impacts, if adopted as proposed.\nFor more information, see the “Regulatory Requirements” section of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity Requirements \nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in wSTWF, including Regions and Regions Bank, are not subject to an LCR or any NSFR. However, BHCs that are Category IV firms are subject to minimum quarterly liquidity buffers and liquidity stress testing requirements under the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards. Additionally, as a \n12\nTable of Contents\n \nCategory IV firm, Regions is required to engage in certain practices, including, but not limited to: (i) calculating collateral positions monthly; (ii) establishing an internally determined set of liquidity risk limits; (iii) monitoring elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures; and (iv) reporting liquidity data on the FR 2052a on a monthly basis. \nResolution Planning\nCategory IV firms such as Regions are not required to submit 165(d) resolution plans. The FDIC separately requires insured depositary institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as Regions Bank, to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of the bank’s failure. Regions Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan in November 2022. \nOn June 20, 2024, the FDIC approved a final rule to amend its current resolution plan rule to modify the required frequency and informational content of resolution plan submissions applicable to certain IDIs, which describe the IDI’s strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. The final rule requires IDIs with more than $100 billion in total assets that are not affiliated with a U.S. G-SIB to submit full resolution plans every three years with limited supplements filed in the off years. The rule increases the engagement between the FDIC and covered IDIs on resolution matters, requires periodic testing to validate key capabilities and processes needed in a resolution and introduces a new credibility standard that will be used to evaluate the full resolution plan submissions. If the FDIC finds an IDI’s resolution plan to be not credible, it could subject the IDI to an enforcement action. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2024. Regions Bank is required to file its next full resolution plan by July 1, 2025, which will be its initial filing under the final rule.\nFDIA and Prompt Corrective Action \nThe FDIA requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories (“well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”), and the federal banking agencies must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2024, both Regions and Regions Bank were well-capitalized.\nAn institution that is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital levels may be treated as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment.\nAn institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a BHC must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The BHC must also provide appropriate assurances of performance.\nThe FDIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards. Regulators also must take into consideration: (i) concentrations of credit risk; (ii) interest rate risk (when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution’s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off-balance sheet position); and (iii) risks from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution’s ability to manage those risks, when determining the adequacy of an institution’s capital. Regulators make this evaluation as a part of their regular examination of the institution’s safety and soundness. Additionally, regulators may choose to examine other factors in order to evaluate the safety and soundness of financial institutions.\nSafety and Soundness\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems, informational security, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. For example, the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice, and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder.\nProperly managing risks is critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing banking institutions including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, compliance and reputational risk. Some of the regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, \n13\nTable of Contents\n \nbreaches in internal controls, fraud or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that financial institutions are expected to address in the current environment. To address safety and soundness, Regions Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive and effective internal controls.\nEnforcement Authority\nThe federal banking agencies have broad authority to issue orders to depository institutions and their holding companies prohibiting activities that constitute violations of law, rule, regulation or administrative order, or that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices, as determined by the federal banking agencies.  The federal banking agencies also are empowered to require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice; issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced; direct increases in capital; limit dividends and distributions; restrict growth; assess civil money penalties against institutions or individuals who violate any laws, regulations, orders or written agreements with the agencies; order termination of certain activities of holding companies or their non-bank subsidiaries; remove officers and directors; order divestiture of ownership or control of a non-banking subsidiary by a holding company; or terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver.  \nPayment of Dividends \nRegions is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. The principal source of cash flow to us, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on any of our outstanding debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by Regions Bank to us, as well as by us to our shareholders.\nIf, in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency, an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, such agency may require, after notice and hearing, that such institution cease and desist from such practice. The federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDIA, an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. See “FDIA and Prompt Corrective Action” above. Moreover, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that BHCs and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.\nPayment of Dividends by Regions Bank\n. Under the Federal Reserve’s Regulation H, Regions Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or pay a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank’s net income for that year and (b) its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock.\nUnder Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90% of its net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least 20% of capital. Regions Bank is also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama Superintendent of Banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (a) Regions Bank’s net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal, state and local taxes. Regions Bank cannot, without approval from the Federal Reserve and the Alabama Superintendent of Banking, declare or pay a dividend to Regions unless Regions Bank is able to satisfy the criteria discussed above.\nPayment of Dividends by Regions.\n Payment of dividends to our shareholders is subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. In particular, the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large BHC, such as Regions, are reviewed by the Federal Reserve based on capital plans submitted as part of the CCAR process and may be constrained in certain scenarios. See “Capital Requirements” above. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, Regions is subject to the limitations on dividends and share repurchases set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL). The DGCL allows Regions to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or if it has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. \n \nIn addition, the DGCL does not permit Regions to repurchase shares of its capital stock where the repurchase would cause an impairment of the capital of the corporation. \nSupport of Subsidiary Banks \nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, Regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, its subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when Regions may not be inclined to provide it. \n14\nTable of Contents\n \nLimits on Exposure to One Borrower and Exposure to Insiders \nAlabama banking law imposes limits on the amount of credit a bank can extend to any one person (or group of related persons). For Regions Bank, this limit includes credit exposures arising from loan and equivalent exposure and investment and trading exposure.\nApplicable banking laws and regulations also place restrictions on loans by FDIC-insured banks and their affiliates to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.\nLending Standards and Guidance\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. Under these regulations, all IDIs, such as Regions Bank, must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulators’ Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies.\nThe federal banking agencies have also jointly issued guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending,” which defines commercial real estate loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development and construction (including 1-4 family residential construction), multi-family property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50 percent or more of the source of repayment comes from third-party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. The guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. The required heightened risk management practices could include enhanced strategic planning, underwriting policies, risk management, internal controls, portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs. Higher allowances for credit losses and capital levels may also be required. The guidance states that the following metrics may indicate a concentration of commercial real estate loans, but that these metrics are neither limits nor a safe harbor: (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, nonfarm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 percent or more during the prior 36 months.\nDe Novo Branching and De Novo Banks\nWith the approval of applicable regulators, state banks may establish de novo branches in states other than their home state as if such state was the bank’s home state.\nAnti-Tying Provisions\nRegions Bank is prohibited from conditioning the availability of any product or service, or varying the price for any product or service, on the requirement that the customer obtain some additional product or service from the bank or any of its affiliates, other than loans, deposits and trust services.\nTransactions with Affiliates \nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates, including a parent BHC. Regions Bank is subject to these restrictions, which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place, including extensions of credit to affiliates, investments in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates. These restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank. Generally, a bank’s covered transactions with any single affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus.\nDeposit Insurance  \nRegions Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits, which is currently $250,000 per account ownership type. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for an IDI based on an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each IDI poses to the \n15\nTable of Contents\n \nDIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.\nThe FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent within eight years. This plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. Based on the FDIC’s recent projections, however, the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028 without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates.  \nDuring 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. This rule, combined with other factors influenced by Regions’ financial performance, increased regulatory premiums in 2023. The FDIC also concurrently maintained the Designated Reserve Ratio for the DIF at 2 percent. \nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the DIF associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023, which became effective on April 1, 2024. Under the rule, the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of uninsured deposits. The total amount of the special assessment is to be paid in ten quarterly installments that began with the invoice for the first quarter of 2024 (received in June 2024) and will end with the invoice for the second quarter of 2026. The payments are deductible for income taxes. For more details on the special assessment, see the “Non-Interest Expense” section of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFDIC Recordkeeping Requirements\nAs a part of the FDIC Part 370 recordkeeping requirements, Regions is subject to facilitate rapid and accurate payment of FDIC-insured deposits to customers when large IDIs fail. FDIC rules require IDIs with two million or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor's ownership interest by right and capacity and to develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner by ownership right and capacity. \nAcquisitions  \nThe BHC Act requires every BHC to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (i) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition, the BHC will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the voting shares of the institution; (ii) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association; or (iii) it may merge or consolidate with any other BHC. FHCs must obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring certain non-bank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion. FHCs seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be well-capitalized and well-managed.\nThe BHC Act further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the U.S., or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the BHCs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to be served includes the parties’ performance under the CRA. The Federal Reserve must also take into account the institutions’ effectiveness in combating money laundering. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHC Act was amended to require the Federal Reserve to, when evaluating a proposed transaction, consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.\nLate in the preceding administration, the standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions would be evaluated have been undergoing review and change by the OCC, FDIC and DOJ, but not by the Federal Reserve. These reviews and changes were incorporated into non-binding guidance. The DOJ withdrew its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and issued the 2024 Banking Addendum to its 2023 Merger Guidelines. The DOJ clarified that it will assess competition considerations in connection with bank and BHC mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines, which is the general merger review framework the DOJ now uses to evaluate transactions in all segments of the economy, and the 2024 Banking Addendum. The 2024 Banking Addendum provides guidance on how the DOJ will assess competition in the context of bank and bank holding company mergers. An analysis under the 2023 Merger Guidelines and 2024 Banking Addendum may include consideration of theories of harm and relevant markets not considered under the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, which focused primarily on concentrations of deposits and branches. Whether and how the guidance might be further changed or interpreted by the new administration is uncertain.\n16\nTable of Contents\n \nDepositor Preference  \nUnder federal law, claims of depositors and certain claims for both administrative expenses and employee compensation against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver.\nVolcker Rule  \nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be considered an investment company for purposes of the Volcker Rule. The compliance requirements under regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are tailored based on the size and scope of trading activities. Because TAL are maintained under $1 billion, Regions is categorized with \"limited\" TAL and benefits from a presumption of compliance with the Volcker Rule. Regions has put in place the compliance programs required by the Volcker Rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in illiquid funds.   \nConsumer Protection Laws  \nWe are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Act and their respective state law counterparts.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, other fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws for depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The CFPB may issue regulations that impact products and services offered by Regions or Regions Bank. The regulations could reduce the fees that Regions receives, alter the way Regions provides its products and services or expose Regions to greater risk of private litigation or regulatory enforcement action.\nFor example, the CFPB has, among other things, issued final rules as part of an initiative to reduce the amounts and types of fees financial institutions may charge. In December 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule amending Regulation Z that would impose certain requirements on overdraft fees, including requirements similar to those that apply to credit cards under Regulation Z, charged by IDIs with more than $10 billion in total assets unless the IDI limits the overdraft fee to an amount that covers the IDI’s costs and losses to provide the service or $5. The final rule is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2025. Several banking industry groups filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the final rule, in which they argued that the CFPB exceeded its statutory authority in adopting the final rule. In addition, new CFPB leadership has taken actions that call into question the effectiveness of new rules and their implementation dates. Furthermore, under the presidential memorandum entitled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,” rules with future effective dates may be re-evaluated.\n \nTherefore, the Company cannot predict the nature and timing of future developments that may potentially impact CFPB rules and proposals.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\nWe are, or may in the future become, subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules and standards at the federal, state and local level regarding privacy and cybersecurity. Privacy and cybersecurity are currently areas of considerable legislative and regulatory attention, with new or modified laws, regulations, rules and standards being frequently adopted and potentially subject to divergent interpretation or application in a manner that may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for businesses. Privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations often impose strict requirements regarding the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, protection and other processing of personal information, which may have adverse consequences on our business, including incurring significant compliance costs, requiring changes to our business or operations and imposing severe penalties for non-compliance. \nFor example, at the federal level, the federal banking regulators have adopted certain rules, including pursuant to the GLBA, that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public personal information about consumers to third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain non-public personal information to non-affiliated third parties. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure among affiliated companies of certain non-public personal information that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and application information. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share certain information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.\nFederal law also requires financial institutions to implement a written IS Program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The program should be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against unanticipated \n17\nTable of Contents\n \nthreats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Financial institutions must also conduct ongoing oversight of third-party service providers to ensure they are maintaining appropriate security controls. Financial institutions must report on the institution’s cybersecurity program annually to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors. The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense against security threats and to ensure their risk management processes appropriately address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively identify, prevent and detect a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to a cyber-attack. In addition to the GLBA, we are subject to various other federal and state laws, regulations, rules and standards. The Regions IS Program is designed to reflect the regulatory requirements and guidance.\nIn addition, in the spring of 2022, federal banking regulators have imposed a new cybersecurity-related notification rule that requires banking organizations, including Regions and Regions Bank to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and within 36 hours of incidents that, among other things, have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization’s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, or ability to carry out key operations of the banking organization, the failure of which would pose a threat to the stability of the U.S. financial sector. The rule also imposes requirements on bank service providers to notify their affected banking organization customers of certain computer-security incidents. Additionally, the enactment of the CIRCIA in 2022, once rulemaking is complete, will require, among other things, covered entities to report significant cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks, to the CISA  Further, in 2023, the SEC adopted regulations requiring public companies to disclose certain information regarding material cybersecurity incidents impacting those companies, as well as descriptions about how they manage material cybersecurity risks. \nState regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, rules and standards. Several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and have provided detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also implemented or are considering implementing, comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, such as the CCPA. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. Moreover, the United States Congress has considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity legislation, to which Regions and/or Regions Bank may be subject if passed. We expect this trend of state and federal activity to persist, and we continue to monitor such developments in the geographic areas in which our customers are located.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act  \nThe CRA requires Regions Bank’s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the Federal Reserve, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” This assessment is considered for any bank that applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or to open or relocate a branch office. The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a FHC also is assessed by the Federal Reserve in connection with reviewing any proposed acquisition or merger application. Regions Bank’s most recent CRA rating from the Federal Reserve was “Satisfactory.”\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC issued a final rule to amend their regulations implementing the CRA. The rule materially revises the current CRA framework, including the assessments areas in which a bank is evaluated to include activities associated with online and mobile banking, the tests used to evaluate the bank in its assessment areas, new methods of calculating credit for lending, investment and service activities and additional data collection and reporting requirements. The rule is expected to result in a significant increase in the thresholds for large banks to receive “Outstanding” ratings in the future. The rule was originally intended to take effect on April 1, 2024, with most of the provisions becoming applicable on January 1, 2026 and reporting of the collected data would not be required until 2027. Several banking industry groups filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the final rule, in which they argued that the agencies exceeded their statutory authority in adopting it. In March 2024, a preliminary injunction was granted that provides a day-for-day extension for each day the injunction remains in place. The court's decision granting a preliminary injunction is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Uncertainty consequently remains around the actual implementation date, as well as around which elements of the final rule may be implemented. The Company continues to monitor the outcome of this rule.\nCompensation Practices \nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. The federal banking regulators have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive \n18\nTable of Contents\n \ncompensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness.\nAnti-Money Laundering  \nA continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Regions Bank is subject to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA. The BSA requires financial institutions to, among other things, establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act, which amended the BSA, broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes internal policies, procedures and internal controls, the designation of a chief compliance officer, as well as training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain due diligence on private bank accounts and due diligence on and verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition. A financial institution's failure to comply with the BSA could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Regions Bank has continued to augment its anti-money laundering compliance program to comply with the BSA and its implementing regulations and will continue to revise and update its anti-money laundering policies, procedures and controls to reflect future regulatory changes. The AMLA, which amends the BSA, was enacted in January 2021. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Treasury for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemaking, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, implementation guidance. \nAs required by AMLA, in June 2021, FinCEN, which promulgates the implementing regulations of the USA PATRIOT Act, BSA, and other anti-money laundering legislation, issued the national anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism priorities. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. Banks are not required to implement any immediate changes related to the national priorities to their anti-money laundering compliance programs until FinCEN issues the implementing regulations related to the national priorities. Bank regulators continue to examine financial institutions for anti-money laundering compliance and Regions Bank will continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance framework, including the anti-money laundering program, policies and procedures of Regions Bank to ensure that it is commensurate with our risk profile.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation \nThe U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, organizations, regimes and other entities. In the United States, economic sanctions are administered by OFAC. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets, issues regulations and implements executive orders that restrict dealings with certain countries and territories. Territorial sanctions, which target certain countries, regions and territories, take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property within U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). OFAC also administers sanctions lists that have various associated prohibitions, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with Specially Designated Nationals regardless of location, and all assets of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons are blocked. Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a general or specific license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.\n19\nTable of Contents\n \nRegulation of Broker Dealers and Investment Advisers  \nOur subsidiaries, Regions Securities and BlackArch Securities LLC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and FINRA, and Regions Investment Management, Inc. and Highland Associates, Inc. are registered investment advisers with the SEC. These subsidiaries are, as a result, subject to regulation and examination by the SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations. These regulations cover a broad range of issues, including capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material non-public information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. In addition to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration of certain broker-dealers and investment advisers.\nCompetition \nAll aspects of our business are highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states, as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, fintechs, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations. We expect competition to remain intense among financial services companies. Our success will depend, in part, on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services. Further, despite delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we expect consolidation in the financial services industry to continue, which may produce larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. \nIn addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer traditional bank or bank-like products and services and therefore compete with financial institutions like us in providing electronic, internet-based and mobile phone-based financial solutions. In particular, the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. A number of fintechs have applied for, and in some cases been granted, bank or industrial loan charters, while other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. In addition to fintechs, traditional technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Regions provides an array of digital products and services to our customers and we expect a bank’s digital offerings to be a key competitive differentiator. The continued move toward digital banking and financial services, combined with customer expectations regarding digital offerings, will require us to invest greater resources in technological improvements. Customers for banking services and other financial services offered by our subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience, quality of service, price of service, personal contacts, the quality of the technology that supports the customer experience and availability of products. Although our position varies in different markets, we believe that our affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant market areas. \nHuman Capital\nOne pillar of our strategic priorities at Regions is the commitment to “Build the Best Team”. We believe one of the biggest differentiators of our performance is the people we employ. The need to attract, retain and develop the right talent to accomplish our strategic plan is central to our success. As of December 31, 2024, Regions and its subsidiaries had 19,644 full-time equivalent employees supporting our consumer and commercial banking, wealth management and mortgage product and services primarily across the Southeast and Midwest. \nA strong and impactful human capital program begins at the top. Our Board oversees our corporate strategy and sets the tone for our culture, values and high ethical standards, and through its Committees, holds management accountable. The primary committee responsible for the oversight of human capital is the CHR Committee. The CHR Committee strategically meets with subject matter experts regarding talent management and acquisition, succession planning, associate conduct, associate learning and development, inclusive practices, and associate retention. Additionally, on a quarterly basis the CHR Committee reviews the HCM Dashboard which includes a mixture of trending and point-in-time metrics designed to provide information and analysis of workforce demographics; talent acquisition; workforce stability (retention, turnover, etc.); and associate conduct and engagement.\nIn order to build the best team, it is necessary for us to fill talent needs with qualified and engaged associates. Key to our success is our internal talent management program which strives to optimally deploy existing talent across Regions by focusing on where our associates excel and helping them find the best roles that maximize their talents, abilities and interests. For those roles which we fill externally, we continually build talent pipelines with an eye toward not only current needs, but also future demands of our business. Regions uses innovative tools and structured processes to achieve our goals including applications and resources designed to reach broader audiences. Our recruiting technology is agile, user friendly and allows us to offer to candidates a robust understanding of our needs, requirements and a view of our culture to support the building of an inclusive and engaged workforce.\n20\nTable of Contents\n \nRegions provides transparency into our workforce demographics by disclosing 2023 EEO-1 results on our 2023 Workforce Demographics Report available on our website, www.regions.com. Information included on our website is not incorporated into, or otherwise made a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe also consider it critical to our success to invest in the professional development of all of our associates. We emphasize our commitment to professional development through opportunities such as technical, skills-based, management, and leadership training programs; formal talent and performance management processes; and sustainable career paths. We also aim to prepare our workforce for a rapidly changing environment and understand that reskilling and upskilling are crucial to staying competitive, meeting the needs of the modern workforce, and retaining associates. We have established a customized learning experience platform that provides the tools to measure, build, and communicate skills inside the Company. This tool provides the ability to inventory the skills our associates have, allowing us to target our development efforts on specific areas where elevated skills are needed. Regions also offers leader development programs created to help people managers understand how to evaluate performance by leveraging the power of a strengths-based and engagement-focused workforce and culture. Our partnership with Guild, an education, skilling and mobility solution provider has allowed us to transition our tuition reimbursement program for associates to a best-in-class tuition assistance program that targets adult learners and provides coaching support and access to a curated catalog from Guild’s Learning Marketplace. Through the Guild program, associates can now pursue a degree or other educational opportunities while building their career at the same time. By removing barriers and expanding access to education, we are continuing our commitment to Build the Best Team.\nUnderstanding that automation, cognitive technologies and the open talent economy are reshaping the future of work, Regions makes available to technology associates courses on-demand that offer intensive learning in application development, information technology operations, security and technology architecture. This solution also offers professional development for data and business professionals. In addition, almost all associates may access a full suite of courses regardless of whether the application is needed in their current role.\nWe aim to offer competitive and fair compensation to our associates. Base salaries are established considering market competitive rates for specific roles; additionally, on an individual basis base salaries reflect the experience and performance levels of our associates. We assess the competitiveness of our ranges on an annual basis by benchmarking our rates against those paid by our peers. In addition to base salaries, we promote a robust pay-for-performance philosophy and incentivize a large majority of our associate population with incentive compensation designed to drive strategies, behaviors and business goals within our unique lines of business. Long-term stock-based incentive compensation is also key to the attraction and retention of key talent and is offered thoughtfully to our executive and leadership ranks. We believe tying the interests of our leaders to those of our shareholders creates a strong link to company performance.\nAs the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our associates, we aim to offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits program to support associates throughout all life stages. Our benefits include comprehensive health, life, and disability coverage that are funded in whole or in part by the Company as well as a 401(k) plan with a dollar-for-dollar company match on employee contributions up to 5 percent of pay and a base contribution of 2 percent of pay for all associates who do not participate in our grandfathered pension program. We also offer our associates programs and tools to support their total well-being including a range of flexible work arrangements, generous time-off policies, physical, mental and financial wellness benefits as well as other programs and practices that support associates and their families throughout the full spectrum of their careers and lives.\nAvailable Information \nWe maintain a website at ir.regions.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, Form DEF 14A, and current reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports that are filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These documents are made available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC also maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including Regions. Also available on our website are our (i) Corporate Governance Principles, (ii) Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, (iii) Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, (iv) Fair Disclosure Policy, (v) the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation and Human Resources Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Risk Committee, Technology Committee, and Executive Committee, and (vi) a number of voluntary disclosures, reports and other documents.

  "item7": "Item 7.  \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nManagement believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of Regions' business, particularly regarding its 2024 results. Cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within MD&A and the consolidated financial statements are included. This summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with the entire MD&A and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEconomic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets  \nAfter what is expected to be full-year 2024 growth of around 2.8 percent, Regions' baseline forecast anticipates real GDP growth of 2.2 percent in 2025. Though the economy grew at a robust pace in 2024, performance across individual sectors varied considerably. Interest rates rose over the latter part of 2024, reflecting persistent inflation pressures and uncertainty over looming policy changes. The Company's  baseline forecast anticipates real GDP growth settling back toward the pre-pandemic trend rate of growth over coming quarters. There is considerable uncertainty around any forecast for 2025 made before the specific details of changes to fiscal, trade, immigration, and regulatory policy are made known.\nThe pace of job growth slowed over the course of 2024 reflecting a slower pace of hiring amongst firms as opposed to a rising pace of layoffs. The combination of slowing job growth and rapid growth in the supply of labor pushed the unemployment rate higher in 2024. While Regions' forecast anticipates further moderation in the pace of job growth, it also anticipates much slower growth in the supply of labor, in part reflecting likely changes to immigration policy. These two factors should leave the unemployment rate relatively unchanged from where it ended 2024, with an expected annual average rate of 4.2 percent for 2025.\nDespite slowing job growth, aggregate labor earnings, the largest component of personal income, have continued to grow at a rate faster than inflation, which is expected to remain the case through 2025. This will continue to act as a support for consumer spending, and Regions' forecast anticipates growth in consumer spending will align more closely with growth in after-tax income than has been the case over the past few years. Nonetheless, the divide in spending patterns across the various income cohorts that has developed over recent quarters will likely persist in 2025.\nStill-soft global economic growth and uncertainty around looming policy changes have acted as headwinds for the manufacturing sector. Business capital spending has been somewhat limited in range, but the Company's forecast anticipates faster growth over the back half of 2025, in part reflecting expectations there will be a push to enhance labor productivity. Additionally, what is anticipated to be a more conducive regulatory environment could trigger a meaningful pick-up in merger and acquisition activity in 2025.\nMortgage rates moved higher along with yields on longer-dated U.S. Treasury securities during the fourth quarter of 2024, dealing a setback to construction and sales of new single family homes. Builders have been able to facilitate sales via aggressive use of incentives, including mortgage rate buydowns, but have been more focused on paring down spec inventories. As such, construction starts of new single family homes tailed off over the second half of 2024 and Regions' forecast anticipates further declines in 2025.\nThough the FOMC cut the Fed funds rate at their final meeting of 2024, it signaled a slower pace of rate cuts in 2025. Inflation pressures have proven to be more persistent than had been anticipated, and while having some concerns about cooling labor market conditions, FOMC members perceive growing upside risks to their inflation forecasts. Regions' baseline forecast anticipates two twenty-five basis point funds rate cuts in 2025, though the timing of any cuts remains somewhat uncertain, particularly given the perceived inflation impacts of looming changes to fiscal, trade, and immigration policy. To the extent there is less relief on the rates front than anticipated, potential downside risks from certain pockets of commercial real estate and the volume of debt in the non-financial corporate sector coming up for refinancing over coming quarters will continue to loom over the outlook.\nPatterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be broadly similar to those seen for the U.S. as a whole. As the Company anticipated, the pace of domestic in-migration into the Regions footprint slowed in 2024, likely reflecting a less dynamic labor market and challenging housing market conditions. Still, this left the pace of domestic in-migration in line with pre-pandemic norms, and growth in total population in the footprint continued to easily outpace the national average, and that also remains the case with growth in nonfarm payrolls. Some of the metro areas which had seen the largest cumulative increases over the prior few years have begun to see house prices decline, but underlying demand, in part reflecting above-average population growth, will help stem the extent of any such declines. Also, given the extent to which house prices have risen over recent years in these markets, the declines in house prices do not threaten to push owners into negative equity positions.  \nThe economic environment, as described above, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of December 31, 2024. See the \"Allowance\" section for further information.\n47\nTable of Contents\n \n2024 Results\nRegions reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.8 billion or $1.93 per diluted share in 2024 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $2.0 billion or $2.11 per diluted share in 2023.\nNet interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $4.9 billion in 2024 compared to $5.4 billion in 2023. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.54 percent in 2024, reflecting a 36 basis point decrease from 2023. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were primarily driven by higher funding costs, which included an increase in deposit costs due to continued re-mixing. Partially offsetting the increase in funding costs was higher asset yields benefiting from the maturity and continued replacement of lower-yielding, fixed-rate loans and securities. See Table 2 \"Volume and Yield/Rate Variances\" for further details.\nThe provision for credit losses totaled $487 million in 2024 compared to $553 million in 2023. The provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $29 million in 2024. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by asset quality normalization. Refer to the \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail.\nNon-interest income improved slightly, totaling $2.3 billion in both 2024 and 2023. The improvement was driven by increases in most categories, led by capital markets income. These increases were largely offset by net securities losses and decreased card and ATM fees. See Table 3 \"Non-Interest Income\" for further details. \nNon-interest expense was $4.2 billion in 2024 and $4.4 billion in 2023. The decrease was driven by declines in operational losses, FDIC insurance assessments primarily related to the special assessment initially recognized in 2023, and miscellaneous expenses. The declines were partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits. See Table 4 \"Non-Interest Expense\" for further details.\nRegions' effective tax rate was 19.6 percent in 2024 compared to 20.5 percent in 2023. See the \"Income Taxes\" section for further details.\nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n\"Operating Results\" section of MD&A\n•\n“Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin” discussion within the “Operating Results” section of MD&A\n•\n“Interest Rate Risk” discussion within the “Risk Management” section of MD&A\nCapital\nCapital Actions\nRegions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results.\nOn April 20, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Regions repurchased approximately 34 million shares of common stock under this program, which reduced shareholders' equity by $614 million. On December 10, 2024, the Board authorized an extension of the common stock repurchase program through the fourth quarter of 2025.\nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n\"Shareholders' Equity\" discussion in MD&A\n•\n\"Regulatory Requirements\" section of MD&A\n•\nNote 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements\nRegulatory Capital\nRegions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. The Basel III Rules maintain the minimum guidelines for Regions to be considered well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital at 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2024, Regions’ Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios were estimated to be 12.17% and 14.06%, respectively. \nThe Basel III Rules also officially defined CET1. Regions' CET1 ratio at December 31, 2024 was estimated to be 10.80%. \nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n“Supervision and Regulation” discussion within Item 1. Business\n48\nTable of Contents\n \n•\n\"Regulatory Requirements\" section of MD&A\n•\nNote 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements\nLoan Portfolio and Credit\nDuring 2024, total loans decreased by $1.7 billion or 1.7 percent compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the commercial portfolio of $1.2 billion. The decline in commercial loans, specifically commercial and industrial loans, is due to lower line of credit utilization and loans refinanced off the Company's balance sheet through the debt capital markets. Refer to the \"Portfolio Characteristics\" section for further discussion.\nNet charge-offs totaled $458 million, or 0.47 percent of average loans, in 2024, compared to $397 million, or 0.40 percent in 2023, driven by an increase in commercial and industrial  and commercial investor real estate mortgage net charge-offs. The allowance was 1.79 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2024, an increase from 1.73 percent at December 31, 2023. The coverage ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding held for sale was 186 percent at December 31, 2024, compared to 211 percent at December 31, 2023.\nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n\"Portfolio Characteristics\" section of MD&A\n•\n“Allowance for Credit Losses” discussion within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of  MD&A\n•\n“Provision for Credit Losses” discussion within the “Operating Results” section of MD&A\n•\n“Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Non-performing Assets” discussions within the “Balance Sheet Analysis” section of MD&A\n•\nNote 4 \"Loans\" to the consolidated financial statements \n•\nNote 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements\nLiquidity\nAt the end of 2024, Regions Bank had $7.8 billion in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 76 percent. Cash and cash equivalents at the parent company totaled $2.4 billion. Cash at the Federal Reserve increased from December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve was $21.6 billion based on available collateral. Borrowing availability with the FHLB was $10.2 billion based on available collateral at the same date. Regions also maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by the Company to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. \nRegions is required to conduct liquidity stress testing and measure its available sources of liquidity against minimums as established by Regions' internal liquidity policy. Regions was fully compliant with those requirements as of year-end. \nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n“Supervision and Regulation” discussion within Item 1.

The emphasis of this discussion will be on operations for the years 2024 and 2023; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate. \nRegions’ profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions’ net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and \n49\nTable of Contents\n \ntrust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software expenses, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.\nEconomic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions’ market areas.\nRegions’ business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking.\nBusiness Segments\nRegions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. \nSee Note 22 \"Business Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on Regions’ business segments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RELATED POLICIES\nIn preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP, regulatory guidance, where applicable, and general banking practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to the allowance, fair value measurements, intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets), MSRs measured at fair value, and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance\nThe allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Regions determines its allowance in accordance with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance.\nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements for information about areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance. \nThe allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as changes in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, inflation, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. \nManagement considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.\nChanges in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates.  Volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The scenarios discussed below, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. Changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be \n50\nTable of Contents\n \ndirectionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, Regions estimated the allowance using a scenario that was one standard deviation unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable. This unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance approximately 15 percent higher than the allowance using the expected scenario.\nSimilar to the scenarios above, it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the allowance. Changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across product or industry types. Regions conducted a separate sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. Regions stressed risk ratings by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans. This scenario resulted in an allowance approximately 20 percent higher for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios.\nFair Value Measurements\nA portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These include debt securities available for sale, mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily determinable market values), residential MSRs, commercial MSRs through non-DUS agency programs and derivative assets and liabilities. From time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. For example, the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information, less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types. The determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.\nFair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity, management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. The value to the Company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates.\nA fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the Company utilizes. Fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company-specific data (Level 3 valuations). These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.\nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes.\nIntangible Assets \nRegions’ intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses (“goodwill”) and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses). Goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Goodwill is allocated to each of Regions’ reportable segments (each a reporting unit: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management). Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist (refer to Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). \nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024, by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed.  In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory actions and assessments, \n51\nTable of Contents\n \nchanges in the business climate, company-specific factors, and trends in the banking industry.  After assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values. Therefore, a quantitative impairment test was not required. Refer to Note 9 \"Intangible Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill.\nSpecific factors as of the date of filing the consolidated financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include: a protracted decline in the Company’s market capitalization; adverse business trends resulting from litigation and/or regulatory actions; higher loan losses; forecasts of high unemployment levels; future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds (refer to Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements); future federal rules and regulations (e.g., such as those resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act); and/or significant volatility in interest rates.\nOther identifiable intangible assets such as relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. These events could include loss of customer relationships, increased competition, or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to Regions’ operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s review indicated there was no impairment in the value of the other identifiable intangible assets.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nRegions has elected to measure and report both its residential MSRs and commercial MSRs through non-DUS agency programs using the fair value method. Although sales of MSRs do occur, MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are therefore Level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the \"Fair Value Measurements\" section. Specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential and commercial MSRs. As a result, Regions stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, as applicable. Regions values its residential and commercial MSRs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. These techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, escrow balances and servicing costs. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of MSRs which impacts earnings. \nRefer to Note 6 \"Servicing of Financial Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information including quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of MSRs.  \nIncome Taxes\nAccrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management’s estimate of income taxes to be paid or received. The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple state and local jurisdictions. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Therefore, the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the Company’s tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method with the net balance reported in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. In projecting future taxable income, the Company utilizes forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated temporary differences and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. Determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards.\nThe Company’s estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes in income tax rates and changes in operating activities. Any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n52\nTable of Contents\n \nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 19 \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN \nNet interest income is Regions’ principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of Regions’ ability to meet its overall performance goals. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by both long-term and short-term market interest rates. Long-term and short-term rates were higher for most of 2024 compared to 2023. Late in the third quarter of 2024, the FOMC decreased the Fed funds rate by approximately 50 basis points and by an additional 25 basis points at the November and December meetings, for a total of 100 basis points. See the \"Executive Overview\" for a discussion of recent FOMC activity.\nNet interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) decreased by $503 million in 2024 compared to 2023, and net interest margin decreased by 36 basis points to 3.54 percent in 2024. This represents a normalization from elevated post-pandemic levels. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven primarily by higher funding costs in a prolonged high rate environment. In 2024, funding costs, which includes deposits and wholesale borrowings utilized during the year, increased to 1.73 percent compared to 1.19 percent in 2023. The increase in funding costs was driven by higher deposit costs due to continued deposit remixing as depositors moved into higher interest earning products, albeit at a slower pace than the remixing experienced in 2023. Deposit costs increased to 1.56 percent for 2024 compared to 0.99 percent for 2023.  \nPartially offsetting the increase in funding costs were higher asset yields benefiting from the maturity and continued replacement of lower-yielding, fixed-rate loans and securities. The Company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day term SOFR, which averaged 5.19 percent in 2024 compared to 4.98 percent in 2023. Additionally, fixed-rate lending production, which contains significant residential mortgage fixed-rate exposure, benefited from higher middle and long-term rates. The Company also continued its reinvestment strategy in the securities portfolio and executed multiple, distinct debt securities repositioning transactions. As a result, the debt securities yield increased to 2.89 percent in 2024 from 2.38 percent in 2023.

Over recent years, changes in the interest rate environment and the impact on product pricing and mix has been the primary contributor to changes in net interest income. \nThe mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. Regions’ primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. Certain types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as securities or interest-bearing deposits in other banks. Average earning assets in 2024 totaled $137.5 billion, a decrease of $383 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a modest decline in loans, net of unearned income, partially offset by growth in debt securities and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. See the \"Loans\" and \"Debt Securities\" sections for further details. \nThe mix of interest-bearing liabilities can also affect the interest spread. Funding for Regions’ earning assets comes from interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. As previously discussed, in 2024 the Company continued to experience a remixing of deposits into higher-interest-bearing categories, albeit at a slower pace. Higher balances within these categories contributed to the overall increase in funding costs.  \n PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. During 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled $487 million and net charge-offs were $458 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $553 million and net charge-offs of $397 million in 2023.\nFor further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses, see the \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" and  “Risk Management” sections found later in this report. See also Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n55\nTable of Contents\n \nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTable 3—Non-Interest Income \n \nYear Ended December 31\nChange 2024 vs. 2023\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\nService charges on deposit accounts \n$\n612 \n$\n592 \n$\n641 \n$\n20 \n3.4 \n%\nCard and ATM fees\n467 \n504 \n513 \n(37)\n(7.3)\n%\nCapital markets income\n348 \n222 \n339 \n126 \n56.8 \n%\nInvestment management and trust fee income\n338 \n313 \n297 \n25 \n8.0 \n%\nMortgage income\n146 \n109 \n156 \n37 \n33.9 \n%\nInvestment services fee income\n157 \n138 \n122 \n19 \n13.8 \n%\nCommercial credit fee income\n111 \n105 \n96 \n6 \n5.7 \n%\nBank-owned life insurance\n102 \n78 \n62 \n24 \n30.8 \n%\nMarket valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets\n25 \n15 \n(45)\n10 \n66.7 \n%\nInsurance proceeds \n(1)\n— \n— \n50 \n— \nNM\nSecurities gains (losses), net\n(208)\n(5)\n(1)\n(203)\nNM\nOther miscellaneous income\n167 \n185 \n199 \n(18)\n(9.7)\n%\n$\n2,265 \n$\n2,256 \n$\n2,429 \n$\n9 \n0.4 \n%\n_______  \nNM- Not meaningful.\n(1) In the third quarter of 2022, the Company settled a previously disclosed matter with the CFPB. The Company received an insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the settlement.\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts\nService charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees, treasury management fees and other customer transaction-related service charges. Service charges increased modestly in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by an increase in fees from treasury management services. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in overdraft fees as a result of recent overdraft-related policy enhancements.\nOn October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal  for public comment that, if finalized, would lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive for a debit card transaction. Under the proposed rule the maximum interchange fee would be subject to adjustments every other year based upon issuer cost data. The Company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact.\nOn December 12, 2024, the CFPB adopted a final rule that caps overdraft fees in line with a benchmark fee of $5 or an amount that covers an institution's costs and losses using a standard set forth in the rules. Alternatively, an institution can charge higher overdraft fees by complying with the standard regulatory requirements governing other loans, including credit cards. The final rule is currently scheduled to take effect on October 1, 2025. However, under the presidential memorandum entitled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,” rules with future effective dates may be re-evaluated. Therefore, though the Company will continue to monitor and evaluate potential impact, the nature and timing of future developments that may potentially impact this or other CFPB rules and proposals cannot be predicted. \nCard and ATM Fees\nCard and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. Card and ATM fees decreased in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by credit card rewards liability adjustments combined with higher trending rewards utilization, as well as a decline in foreign ATM revenue due to elimination of balance inquiry fees in February 2024.\nCapital Markets Income\nCapital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Capital markets income increased in 2024 compared to 2023, impacted by a benefit from less negative credit/debit valuation adjustments due to rate and spread movements. Additionally, all other categories of capital markets income were higher year-over-year due to increased transaction volume and deal activity.\n56\nTable of Contents\n \nMortgage Income \nMortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase in mortgage income in 2024 compared to 2023 was due primarily to an increase in servicing income due to bulk purchases of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans in the third quarter of 2023 and $8 billion of residential mortgage loans at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in mortgage production and margins sold to the agencies. These increases were offset by a reduction in the valuation of MSRs and related hedges.\nInvestment Services Fee Income\nInvestment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. Investment services fee income increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to strong advisor production.\nBank-owned Life Insurance\nBank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Bank-owned life insurance income increased during 2024 compared to 2023 driven primarily by increased claim volume.\nMarket Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets\nMarket value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-interest expense.\nSecurities Gains (Losses), Net\nNet securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's asset/liability and capital management processes. In 2024, the Company sold debt securities and reinvested the proceeds at higher current market yields, incurring $205 million in total pre-tax losses. See Table 5 \"Debt Securities\" for more information. An additional $3 million in losses was incurred associated with the sale of certain employee benefit assets. \nTable 4—Non-Interest Expense \n \n \nYear Ended December 31\nChange 2024 vs 2023\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\nPercent\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n2,529 \n$\n2,416 \n$\n2,318 \n$\n113 \n4.7 \n%\nEquipment and software expense\n406 \n412 \n392 \n(6)\n(1.5)\n%\nNet occupancy expense\n278 \n289 \n300 \n(11)\n(3.8)\n%\nOutside services\n162 \n163 \n157 \n(1)\n(0.6)\n%\nMarketing\n110 \n110 \n102 \n— \n— \n%\nProfessional, legal and regulatory expenses\n94 \n85 \n263 \n9 \n10.6 \n%\nCredit/checkcard expenses\n59 \n60 \n66 \n(1)\n(1.7)\n%\nFDIC insurance assessments\n109 \n228 \n61 \n(119)\n(52.2)\n%\nVisa class B shares expense\n32 \n28 \n24 \n4 \n14.3 \n%\nOperational losses\n95 \n212 \n56 \n(117)\n(55.2)\n%\nEarly extinguishment of debt\n— \n(4)\n— \n4 \n100.0 \n%\nBranch consolidation, property and equipment charges\n3 \n7 \n3 \n(4)\n(57.1)\n%\nOther miscellaneous expenses\n365 \n410 \n326 \n(45)\n(11.0)\n%\n$\n4,242 \n$\n4,416 \n$\n4,068 \n$\n(174)\n(3.9)\n%\nSalaries and Employee Benefits\nSalaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in incentives, base salaries, and benefits expenses. Salaries and employee benefits were also impacted by an increase in market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets that are offset in non-interest income. Full-time equivalent headcount decreased to 19,644 at December 31, 2024 from 20,101 at  December 31, 2023.\nProfessional, Legal and Regulatory Expenses\nProfessional, legal, and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to accruals for legal and regulatory matters in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower other professional fees.\n57\nTable of Contents\n \nFDIC Insurance Assessments\nFDIC insurance assessments decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily resulting from the special assessment that was initially recorded in 2023.\nFederal law requires that any losses to the FDIC’s DIF related to the protection of uninsured depositors under the Systemic Risk Exception be repaid by a special assessment on IDIs. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC finalized a special assessment related to the two March 2023 bank failures, which was required to be recognized as the accrual of a liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $119 million. In late February 2024, the FDIC published revised loss estimates related to the failures, increasing the estimated loss to the DIF. Based on updated information provided by the FDIC, Regions increased the special assessment accrual during 2024 by $16 million. The total special assessment is to be paid in ten quarterly installments that began with the invoice for the first quarter of 2024 (received in June 2024) and are deductible for income taxes.\nIn addition to the reduction in accruals for the special assessment, favorability in the base assessment which was driven by higher levels of unsecured debt and cash as well as lower exposures in higher risk assets, further drove the year-over-year decrease in FDIC insurance assessments.\nOperational Losses\nOperational losses include losses related to fraud, execution, delivery and process management, and damage to physical assets. Operational losses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to check fraud that occurred in the second and third quarters of 2023.\nOther Miscellaneous Expenses \nOther miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to lower pension related costs and a reduction for a contingent reserve release in the second quarter of 2024 related to a prior acquisition.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company’s income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $461 million compared to $533 million in 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of 19.6% and 20.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2024 was primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023, causing tax preferential items to have a more favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to UTBs. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $775 million compared to $741 million at December 31, 2023. \nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 19 \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nThe following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories. \nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents increased approximately $3.9 billion from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2023 to $10.7 billion at December 31, 2024 resulting from an increase in cash balances on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank driven primarily by FHLB advances utilized in 2024. Cash balances were also impacted by a decline in loans. See the \"Loans\", \"Liquidity\" and \"Borrowed Funds\" sections for more information.\n58\nTable of Contents\n \nDEBT SECURITIES\n The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including both held to maturity and available for sale, as of December 31:\nTable 5—Debt Securities \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n2,003 \n$\n1,223 \nFederal agency securities\n444 \n1,043 \nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n2 \n2 \nMortgage-backed securities:\nResidential agency\n22,865 \n17,611 \nCommercial agency\n4,597 \n7,822 \nCommercial non-agency\n82 \n83 \nCorporate and other debt securities\n658 \n1,074 \n$\n30,651 \n$\n28,858 \nDebt securities, which comprise approximately 22 percent of earning assets, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company, as much of the portfolio is highly liquid. Additionally, some of the securities portfolio is eligible to be used as collateral for funding of various types of borrowings. See the \"Liquidity\" section for more information on these arrangements.  Also see the \"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk\" section for more information.\nDebt securities held to maturity constituted approximately 14 percent of the securities portfolio at December 31, 2024. The Company reclassified securities with an amortized cost, excluding items recognized in OCI, of $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion, in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively, from available for sale into held to maturity to reduce the volatility in AOCI in preparation for expected, upcoming changes to regulatory guidance as discussed in the \"Regulatory Requirements\" section. See also Note 3 \"Debt Securities\" for additional information.\nDebt securities available for sale, constituted approximately 86 percent of the securities portfolio at December 31, 2024. Regions maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency MBS. Regions’ investment policy emphasizes credit quality and liquidity. Debt securities backed by the U.S. Government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 98 percent of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2024. All other debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by the U.S. Government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 2 percent of total debt securities at December 31, 2024. \nDebt securities increased $1.8 billion from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 as the Company purchased $750 million of residential agency MBS securities with proceeds from a debt issuance in the second quarter of 2024 and an additional $1.0 billion of residential agency MBS securities and U.S Treasury securities with proceeds from a debt issuance in the third quarter of 2024 (see Note 11 \"Borrowed Funds\"). Additionally, four distinct securities repositioning transactions occurred during 2024 involving the sale of mostly shorter-duration commercial agency MBS and replacement with residential agency MBS with favorable prepayment profiles. The intent was to maintain the securities portfolio duration that would otherwise shorten naturally. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested at higher market yields. Through these transactions, in 2024, the Company sold approximately $4.3 billion of debt securities available for sale and realized approximately $205 million in pre-tax losses. \nThe average life of the debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2024 was estimated to be 6.1 years, with a duration of approximately 4.5 years. These metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.5 years and a duration of approximately 4.5 years for the portfolio at December 31, 2023.\n59\nTable of Contents\n \nTable 6 \"Relative Contractual Maturities\" details the contractual maturities of debt securities, including held to maturity and available for sale, and the related weighted-average yields.\nTable 6— Relative Contractual Maturities \n \nDebt Securities Maturing as of December 31, 2024\n \nWithin One\nYear\nAfter One But\nWithin Five\nYears\nAfter Five But\nWithin Ten\nYears\nAfter Ten\nYears\nTotal\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n131 \n$\n1,495 \n$\n372 \n$\n5 \n$\n2,003 \nFederal agency securities\n— \n— \n330 \n114 \n444 \nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n— \n— \n— \n2 \n2 \nMortgage-backed securities:\nResidential agency\n6 \n75 \n859 \n21,925 \n22,865 \nCommercial agency\n247 \n2,293 \n1,841 \n216 \n4,597 \nCommercial non-agency\n— \n— \n— \n82 \n82 \nCorporate and other debt securities\n196 \n436 \n24 \n2 \n658 \n$\n580 \n$\n4,299 \n$\n3,426 \n$\n22,346 \n$\n30,651 \nWeighted-average yield \n(1)\n2.20 \n%\n2.76 \n%\n3.30 \n%\n3.13 \n%\n3.08 \n%\n_________\n(1)\nThe weighted-average yields are calculated on the basis of the yield to maturity based on the carrying value of each debt security.

Lending at Regions is generally organized along three portfolio segments: commercial loans (including commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans), investor real estate loans (commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans) and consumer loans (residential first mortgage, home equity lines and loans, consumer credit card, other consumer—exit portfolios, and other consumer loans). \n60\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table illustrates a year-over-year comparison of loans, net of unearned income, by portfolio segment and class as of December 31:\nTable 8—Loan Portfolio \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions, net of unearned income)\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n49,671 \n$\n50,865 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n4,841 \n4,887 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n333 \n281 \nTotal commercial\n54,845 \n56,033 \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n6,567 \n6,605 \nCommercial investor real estate construction\n2,143 \n2,245 \nTotal investor real estate\n8,710 \n8,850 \nResidential first mortgage\n20,094 \n20,207 \nHome equity lines\n3,150 \n3,221 \nHome equity loans\n2,390 \n2,439 \nConsumer credit card\n1,445 \n1,341 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n4 \n43 \nOther consumer\n6,089 \n6,245 \nTotal consumer\n33,172 \n33,496 \n$\n96,727 \n$\n98,379 \nThe following table details the contractual maturities for loans as of December 31, 2024.

For some lending arrangements, Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on variable rate loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps and interest rate floors. The impact of hedging is not considered within this disclosure. \nPORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS\n Loans, net of unearned income, decreased $1.7 billion year over year, primarily due to decreases in the commercial and industrial portfolio class. Regions manages loan growth with a focus on risk management and risk-adjusted return on capital. \nThe following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 9, explain changes in balances from year-end 2023 and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, and certain loan products. See Note 4 \"Loans\" and Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. \nCommercial\nThe commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans for use in customers' normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, expansion projects and acquisitions. Regions' commercial loans generally mature within a five-year period with applicable amortization based on the underlying collateral or financing purpose. Typical loan structures consist of revolving and non-revolving lines of credit, amortizing term loans, guidance facilities, and single-pay loans, further tailored to meet the specific needs of the customer. These loans frequently have a covenant package combination inclusive of applicable debt service coverage, leverage, and liquidity measurements.\nUnderwriting of commercial loans includes the assessment of the financial performance and profile, management experience and capability, industry position and outlook, the applicability of the transactional structure, as well as the repayment enhancement provided by collateral, guarantees, and ownership or sponsorship. Any forward view of operating performance is tested against applicable stressors that may include revenue decline, margin compression, and interest rate hikes. \nCommercial and industrial loans decreased $1.2 billion since year-end 2023, due to lower line of credit utilization and loans refinanced off the Company's balance sheet through the debt capital markets. Throughout 2024, the decline in commercial and industrial loans was broad-based as shown in Table 11.\nThe commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing on real estate assets, and are repaid by cash generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. These owner-occupied real estate and real estate construction loans generally mature within a 10 year period and with amortization periods reflecting the longer life of the underlying collateral. Typical structure is an amortizing term loan, though construction loans are short-term, monitored, non-revolving draw facilities. These loans frequently have a covenant package combination \n62\nTable of Contents\n \nconsistent with the underwriting of commercial loans, inclusive of applicable debt service coverage, leverage, and liquidity measurements.\nUnderwriting for owner-occupied real estate and real estate construction loans is consistent with the underwriting of commercial loans, with particular attention to the enhancement provided by the underlying real estate collateral. \nReal estate appraisals, for both commercial and IRE loans, are performed in accordance with regulatory guidelines. In some cases, reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed. An appraisal is ordered and reviewed prior to loan closing, and a new appraisal or evaluation is generally ordered when market conditions indicate a potential decline in the value of the collateral, or when the loan is either modified, renewed, or deteriorates to a certain level of credit weaknesses. \nOver half of the Company’s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in Table 11. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. \nInvestor Real Estate\nLoans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions’ IRE portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions’ markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total IRE loans decreased $140 million in comparison to year-end 2023 balances. \nIRE loans generally mature within a three-to-seven-year period and consist of full, partial, and non-recourse guarantee structures. Typical term loan structures include annually testing operating covenants that require loan rebalancing based on minimum debt service coverage, debt yield, and/or LTV tests. Construction and land development loans generally mature in 12 to 24 months for acquisition and development, to 42 to 60 months for construction and contain full or partial recourse guarantee structures with 12 to 24 month extension options or roll-to-permanent financing options that often result in term loans. \nUnderwriting on IRE properties is based on the economic viability of the project with significant consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor, who is responsible for managing the property. The Company generally requires that the owner, who provides the capital to purchase the property, infuse their equity prior to any advances. Re-margining requirements (e.g., required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral) are often included in the loan agreement along with required guarantees of the sponsor.\n63\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial and IRE lending balances in selected industries as of December 31.\nTable 11—Commercial and Investor Real Estate Industry Exposure\n2024\nLoans\nUnfunded Commitments\nTotal Exposure\nPercent of Balance\n(In millions)\nCommercial:\nAdministrative, support, waste and repair\n$\n1,306 \n$\n751 \n$\n2,057 \n2.0 \n%\nAgriculture\n211 \n142 \n353 \n0.3 \n%\nEducational services\n3,229 \n875 \n4,104 \n4.0 \n%\nEnergy \n1,322 \n3,484 \n4,806 \n4.7 \n%\nFinancial services \n8,463 \n9,308 \n17,771 \n17.4 \n%\nGovernment and public sector\n3,121 \n437 \n3,558 \n3.5 \n%\nHealthcare\n3,338 \n2,480 \n5,818 \n5.7 \n%\nInformation\n2,186 \n1,115 \n3,301 \n3.2 \n%\nManufacturing \n5,037 \n5,138 \n10,175 \n9.9 \n%\nProfessional, scientific and technical services \n1,970 \n1,736 \n3,706 \n3.6 \n%\nReal estate\n (1)\n8,857 \n9,110 \n17,967 \n17.6 \n%\nReligious, leisure, personal and non-profit services\n1,579 \n852 \n2,431 \n2.4 \n%\nRestaurant, accommodation and lodging\n1,285 \n216 \n1,501 \n1.5 \n%\nRetail trade\n2,604 \n1,908 \n4,512 \n4.4 \n%\nTransportation and warehousing\n3,655 \n1,645 \n5,300 \n5.2 \n%\nUtilities\n2,329 \n3,223 \n5,552 \n5.4 \n%\nWholesale goods\n4,232 \n3,371 \n7,603 \n7.4 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n121 \n1,677 \n1,798 \n1.8 \n%\nTotal commercial\n$\n54,845 \n$\n47,468 \n$\n102,313 \n100 \n%\nInvestor real estate:\nHotel\n$\n188 \n$\n18 \n$\n206 \n1.8 \n%\nIndustrial\n808 \n160 \n968 \n8.5 \n%\nLand\n74 \n49 \n123 \n1.1 \n%\nMulti-family\n3,834 \n1,417 \n5,251 \n46.2 \n%\nOffice\n1,325 \n34 \n1,359 \n12.0 \n%\nRetail\n314 \n2 \n316 \n2.8 \n%\nSingle-family/condo\n668 \n467 \n1,135 \n10.0 \n%\nData center\n215 \n32 \n247 \n2.2 \n%\nSelf storage\n16 \n1 \n17 \n0.1 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n1,268 \n482 \n1,750 \n15.3 \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n$\n8,710 \n$\n2,662 \n$\n11,372 \n100 \n%\n64\nTable of Contents\n \n2023 \n(3)\nLoans\nUnfunded Commitments\nTotal Exposure\nPercent of Balance\n(In millions)\nCommercial:\nAdministrative, support, waste and repair\n$\n1,461 \n$\n916 \n$\n2,377 \n2.3 \n%\nAgriculture\n239 \n208 \n447 \n0.4 \n%\nEducational services\n3,502 \n827 \n4,329 \n4.2 \n%\nEnergy\n1,484 \n3,349 \n4,833 \n4.7 \n%\nFinancial services \n7,562 \n8,428 \n15,990 \n15.5 \n%\nGovernment and public sector\n3,161 \n414 \n3,575 \n3.5 \n%\nHealthcare\n3,216 \n2,478 \n5,694 \n5.5 \n%\nInformation\n2,791 \n1,250 \n4,041 \n3.9 \n%\nManufacturing \n4,789 \n5,122 \n9,911 \n9.6 \n%\nProfessional, scientific and technical services\n \n2,328 \n1,799 \n4,127 \n4.0 \n%\nReal estate \n(1)\n9,166 \n9,219 \n18,385 \n17.8 \n%\nReligious, leisure, personal and non-profit services\n1,562 \n630 \n2,192 \n2.1 \n%\nRestaurant, accommodation and lodging\n1,408 \n289 \n1,697 \n1.7 \n%\nRetail trade\n2,764 \n2,327 \n5,091 \n4.9 \n%\nTransportation and warehousing\n \n3,486 \n1,858 \n5,344 \n5.2 \n%\nUtilities\n3,044 \n2,732 \n5,776 \n5.6 \n%\nWholesale goods \n4,006 \n3,768 \n7,774 \n7.5 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n64 \n1,511 \n1,575 \n1.6 \n%\nTotal commercial\n$\n56,033 \n$\n47,125 \n$\n103,158 \n100 \n%\nInvestor real estate:\nHotel\n$\n218 \n$\n5 \n$\n223 \n1.8 \n%\nIndustrial\n740 \n141 \n881 \n7.1 \n%\nLand\n109 \n38 \n147 \n1.2 \n%\nMulti-family\n3,483 \n2,103 \n5,586 \n45.3 \n%\nOffice\n1,426 \n64 \n1,490 \n12.1 \n%\nRetail\n340 \n4 \n344 \n2.8 \n%\nSingle-family/condo\n698 \n591 \n1,289 \n10.4 \n%\nData center\n321 \n12 \n333 \n2.7 \n%\nSelf storage\n16 \n3 \n19 \n0.2 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n1,499 \n531 \n2,030 \n16.4 \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n$\n8,850 \n$\n3,492 \n$\n12,342 \n100 \n%\n_______\n(1)\n\"Real estate\" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial products that are real estate related.

When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted.\n65\nTable of Contents\n \nThe Company's total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate lending consists of both unsecured commercial and industrial loans that are real estate related (including REITs) and investor real estate loans and are considered to be well diversified across property types. The following table provides detail of these loans: \nTable 12— Unsecured Commercial Real Estate and Investor Real Estate Exposure\nDecember 31, 2024\nLoan Balance\nPercent of Total \n(1)\n(In millions)\nResidential homebuilders\n$\n1,081 \n7.1 \n%\nApartments \n4,371 \n28.6 \n%\nIndustrial\n2,287 \n15.0 \n%\nData center\n332 \n2.2 \n%\nDiversified\n1,740 \n11.4 \n%\nBusiness offices \n1,473 \n9.6 \n%\nResidential land\n55 \n0.4 \n%\nRetail\n1,458 \n9.5 \n%\nHealthcare \n1,129 \n7.4 \n%\nHotel\n785 \n5.1 \n%\nCommercial land\n19 \n0.1 \n%\nSelf Storage\n296 \n1.9 \n%\nOther\n260 \n1.7 \n%\nTotal \n(2)\n$\n15,286 \n100 \n%\n_______\n(1)\nAmounts calculated based on whole dollar values.\n(2)\nOwner-occupied commercial real estate is not included as the principal source of repayment is individual businesses, which more closely aligns with the commercial portfolio credit performance. \nPortfolios that are experiencing higher risk due to conditions such as inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and adverse underlying market fundamentals resulting in rising vacancies and reductions in net effective rents are identified as portfolios of interest. These portfolios have an increased focus through credit management and monitoring in order to accurately capture risk and enhance strategies for positive resolutions. Included within Table 11 above, the business offices, senior housing (included within healthcare), and trucking (including within transportation and warehousing) portfolios are considered by Regions to be portfolios of interest. The multi-family portfolio that was previously identified as a portfolio of interest was removed in the fourth quarter of 2024 as Regions does not expect near term losses nor has there been a significant amount of downward migration to non-performing status. Recent and potential future interest rate cuts should ease pressure on borrowers across the entire loan portfolio. See Table 13 below for more details on these portfolios, as well as the allowance discussion following Table 16.\nTable 13—Portfolios of Interest\nAs of and for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024\nOffice \n(1)\nSenior Housing \n(2)\nTrucking \n(3)\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommitments\n$\n1,546 \n$\n1,215 \n$\n1,941 \nLoan balance\n$\n1,473 \n$\n1,077 \n$\n1,514 \nLoan balance as a percent of total loans\n1.5 \n%\n1.1 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nNon-performing loans\n$\n241 \n$\n114 \n$\n105 \nCharge-offs\n$\n32 \n$\n10 \n$\n35 \nRelated allowance for credit losses to loans\n7.5 \n%\n3.7 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n___\n(1)    Approximately 89 percent of the office portfolio was secured, with approximately 60 percent of secured balances located in the South region of the U.S, of which 90% were Class A properties. Additionally, the IRE office portfolio had a weighted-average LTV of approximately 69 percent at December 31, 2024, based upon appraisal at origination or most recent received, and a stressed weighted-average LTV of approximately 85 percent as of January 7, 2025, based upon GreenStreet's Commercial Property Price Index. No new loan originations are being contemplated in this portfolio.\n(2)   Senior housing herein represents the CRE portfolio and excludes approximately $147 million in non-real estate commercial loans in the senior housing sector. Client activity in senior housing has been limited for several years as the portfolio has recovered from the vacancy rate lows of 2020-2021, but signs of improvement have been observed with expected improvements continuing in 2025.\n(3)   Considered a portfolio of interest as trucking companies have been working through one of the most prolonged downturns in the U.S. domestic freight market, recent measures of freight demand remained mostly positive. While there is optimism for the industry, the recovery in 2025 is expected to be gradual. Regions' strategy remains primarily centered around larger, existing clients and slowing originations of smaller trucking deals at this point in the cycle. \n66\nTable of Contents\n \nResidential First Mortgage\nResidential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Total residential first mortgage loans decreased $113 million in comparison to year-end 2023 balances. \nHome Equity Lines\nHome equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity lines decreased $71 million in comparison to year-end 2023 balances, as payoffs and paydowns continue to outpace production. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network. \nBeginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term “balloon payment” means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.\nThe following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of December 31, 2024. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.\nTable 14—Home Equity Lines of Credit - Future Principal Payment Resets\nFirst Lien\n% of Total\nSecond Lien\n% of Total\nTotal\n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n$\n78 \n2.47 \n%\n$\n73 \n2.33 \n%\n$\n151 \n2026\n102 \n3.23 \n%\n106 \n3.37 \n%\n208 \n2027\n253 \n8.04 \n%\n214 \n6.79 \n%\n467 \n2028\n248 \n7.86 \n%\n160 \n5.11 \n%\n408 \n2029\n106 \n3.36 \n%\n77 \n2.44 \n%\n183 \n2030-2034\n600 \n19.06 \n%\n1,029 \n32.65 \n%\n1,629 \n2035-2039\n4 \n0.13 \n%\n4 \n0.12 \n%\n8 \nThereafter\n7 \n0.22 \n%\n6 \n0.18 \n%\n13 \nRevolving Loans Converted to Amortizing\n50 \n1.60 \n%\n33 \n1.04 \n%\n83 \nTotal\n$\n1,448 \n45.97 \n%\n$\n1,702 \n54.03 \n%\n$\n3,150 \nHome Equity Loans\nHome equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions’ branch network.\nConsumer Credit Quality Data\nThe Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (“current LTV”). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party that is updated typically every three months. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.\nThe following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the “Above 100%” category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall. \n67\nTable of Contents\n \nTable 15—Estimated Current Loan to Value Ranges\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nResidential\nFirst Mortgage\nHome Equity Lines of Credit\nHome Equity Loans\n \n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n \n(In millions)\nEstimated current LTV:\nAbove 100%\n$\n63 \n$\n2 \n$\n— \n$\n1 \n$\n— \nAbove 80% - 100%\n1,799 \n2 \n3 \n9 \n11 \n80% and below\n17,898 \n1,430 \n1,687 \n1,883 \n484 \nData not available\n334 \n14 \n12 \n2 \n— \n$\n20,094 \n$\n1,448 \n$\n1,702 \n$\n1,895 \n$\n495 \n \nDecember 31, 2023\nResidential\nFirst Mortgage\nHome Equity Lines of Credit\nHome Equity Loans\n \n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n \n(In millions)\nEstimated current LTV:\n`\nAbove 100%\n$\n57 \n$\n2 \n$\n— \n$\n2 \n$\n— \nAbove 80% - 100%\n1,822 \n3 \n2 \n5 \n7 \n80% and below\n17,981 \n1,567 \n1,619 \n2,055 \n365 \nData not available\n347 \n15 \n13 \n5 \n— \n$\n20,207 \n$\n1,587 \n$\n1,634 \n$\n2,067 \n$\n372 \nConsumer Credit Card\nConsumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. Consumer credit card increased $104 million from year-end 2023 driven by both active account and balance per account growth. \nOther Consumer—Exit Portfolios\nExit portfolios primarily include lending initiatives through third parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balances have been in run-off. \nOther Consumer\nOther consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $156 million from year-end 2023 driven by a decline in certain direct lending channels and a slight decline in consumer home improvement lending.\nRegions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for most consumer loans. For more information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\". \nALLOWANCE\nThe allowance represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan portfolio and consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The allowance totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios.\nRegions' quarterly allowance estimation process utilizes loss forecasting models for pooled loans, specific reserves for significant individually evaluated non-performing loans, and qualitative adjustments for items not captured by the models including specific adjustments and general imprecision. Key inputs to Regions' loss forecasting models include, but are not limited to, loan risk ratings (commercial and investor real estate loans), maturity date, days past due and FICO scores (consumer loans), collateral values securing loans, and Regions' internally prepared economic forecast. Changes in any of these factors, assumptions, or the availability of new information, could require the allowance to be adjusted in future periods, perhaps materially. Outputs from the loss forecasting models, in combination with Regions' qualitative framework and other analyses, inform management in its estimation of Regions' expected credit losses to ensure the overall allowance estimate is appropriate from both a bottom-up and top-down perspective. Actual losses could vary, perhaps materially, from management’s estimates. See Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for more information.\n68\nTable of Contents\n \nThe December 31, 2024 allowance was flat compared to September 30, 2024. The stable allowance resulted from increases in specific reserves driven by non-performing loans in portfolios of interest, offset by decreases due to moderate improvement in the economic forecast and decreases in qualitative adjustments as more of the portfolio risk was captured in the forecasting models and specific reserves. The following sections provide additional details on the key components of the allowance.\nBase economic forecast\nIn deriving any forecast, Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available.  Regions' December 2024 baseline forecast was stable compared to the September 2024 forecast. While job and wage growth are slowing, growth in labor earnings is expected to continue to outpace inflation. Global uncertainty and soft growth have acted as a headwind for manufacturing and business capital spending has been somewhat limited, but the Company expects faster growth in the back half of 2025. Core inflation is expected to slow further but remain above the FOMC's 2.0 percent target rate through 2025. The risks to the base economic forecast are considered to be balanced. See the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets discussion in the \"Executive Overview\" section for additional information.\nTable 16 below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the base economic forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of December 31, 2024. The unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the allowance models and is expected to remain relatively consistent over the forecast period.\nTable 16— Macroeconomic Factors in the Forecast\n \nPre-R&S Period\nBase R&S Forecast\nDecember 31, 2024\n4Q2024\n1Q2025\n2Q2025\n3Q2025\n4Q2025\n1Q2026\n2Q2026\n3Q2026\n4Q2026\nUnemployment rate\n4.2 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n3.9 \n%\nReal GDP, annualized % change\n2.5 \n%\n2.2 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n2.2 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n1.9 \n%\nHPI, year-over-year % change\n3.1 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n1.8 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n2.2 \n%\nCPI, year-over-year % change\n2.6 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n2.7 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n2.5 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n2.3 \n%\nPortfolio credit metrics and specific reserves\nCredit metrics are monitored throughout each quarter and are a key consideration in the allowance process. In the fourth quarter of 2024, overall asset quality continued to perform within the Company's expectations. Commercial and investor real estate criticized balances increased approximately $24 million, which included a decrease in classified balances of $192 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. \nNon-performing loans, excluding held for sale, increased approximately $107 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. The increase in non-performing loans was primarily due to credits in previously identified portfolios of interest. The increase in non-performing loans therefore resulted in higher specific reserves in the fourth quarter. See Table 19 for more details regarding non-performing assets. \nQualitative adjustments\nWhile it is the intent of Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies to reflect all risk factors, including incremental risk in portfolios identified as under stress, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. Regions' qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the general imprecision component remained stable as there were no significant changes in the level of uncertainty in the economic scenario or in the models' performance.\nThe qualitative framework also has specific adjustment components which are reserves meant to capture specific issues or events that management believes are not adequately captured in the model outcomes. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Regions maintained qualitative adjustments for certain commercial real estate sectors due to elevated interest rates, vacancy rates and potential declining property values, as well as for certain consumer portfolios where stabilization to historical averages is still anticipated. While qualitative adjustments were maintained in the fourth quarter of 2024, they were reduced from the third quarter of 2024 due to more of the risk being captured in the loss forecasting models and specific reserve estimates, as well as additional portfolio stability resulting in less uncertainty in some portfolios.\n69\nTable of Contents\n \nDetails regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from previous year's totals, are included in Table 17 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\". \nTable 17—Allowance for Credit Losses\nTwelve Months Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nAllowance for loan losses at January 1\n$\n1,576 \n$\n1,464 \n$\n1,479 \nCumulative effect from change in accounting guidance \n(1)\n— \n(38)\n— \nAllowance for loan losses, January 1 (as adjusted for change in accounting guidance) \n(1)\n1,576 \n1,426 \n1,479 \nLoans charged-off:\nCommercial and industrial\n257 \n195 \n102 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n4 \n2 \n5 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n— \n— \n— \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n42 \n— \n5 \nResidential first mortgage\n2 \n1 \n1 \nHome equity lines\n3 \n3 \n5 \nHome equity loans\n— \n1 \n1 \nConsumer credit card\n63 \n52 \n40 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n1 \n50 \n18 \nOther consumer\n189 \n186 \n198 \n561 \n490 \n375 \nRecoveries of loans previously charged-off:\nCommercial and industrial\n57 \n50 \n47 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n2 \n2 \n3 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n1 \n— \n— \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n3 \n— \n2 \nResidential first mortgage\n3 \n1 \n5 \nHome equity lines\n6 \n7 \n12 \nHome equity loans\n— \n1 \n2 \nConsumer credit card\n8 \n8 \n8 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n1 \n3 \n5 \nOther consumer\n22 \n21 \n28 \n103 \n93 \n112 \nNet charge-offs (recoveries):\nCommercial and industrial\n200 \n145 \n55 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n2 \n— \n2 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n(1)\n— \n— \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n39 \n— \n3 \nResidential first mortgage\n(1)\n— \n(4)\nHome equity lines\n(3)\n(4)\n(7)\nHome equity loans\n— \n— \n(1)\nConsumer credit card\n55 \n44 \n32 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n— \n47 \n13 \nOther consumer\n167 \n165 \n170 \n458 \n397 \n263 \nProvision for loan losses\n495 \n547 \n248 \nAllowance for loan losses at December 31\n1,613 \n1,576 \n1,464 \nReserve for unfunded credit commitments at January 1\n124 \n118 \n95 \nProvision for (benefit from) unfunded credit losses\n(8)\n6 \n23 \nReserve for unfunded credit commitments at December 31\n116 \n124 \n118 \nAllowance for credit losses at December 31\n$\n1,729 \n$\n1,700 \n$\n1,582 \nLoans, net of unearned income, outstanding at end of period\n$\n96,727 \n$\n98,379 \n$\n97,009 \nAverage loans, net of unearned income, outstanding for the period\n$\n97,036 \n$\n98,239 \n$\n92,282 \n70\nTable of Contents\n \nTwelve Months Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a % of average loans, annualized \n(2)\n:\nCommercial and industrial\n0.40 \n%\n0.28 \n%\n0.11 \n%\nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n0.04 \n%\n— \n%\n0.04 \n%\nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n(0.18)\n%\n(0.09)\n%\n(0.03)\n%\nTotal commercial\n0.37 \n%\n0.26 \n%\n0.11 \n%\nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n0.60 \n%\n— \n%\n0.06 \n%\nCommercial investor real estate construction\n— \n%\n(0.01)\n%\n— \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n0.45 \n%\n(0.01)\n%\n0.04 \n%\nResidential first mortgage\n(0.01)\n%\n— \n%\n(0.02)\n%\nHome equity lines\n(0.08)\n%\n(0.10)\n%\n(0.19)\n%\nHome equity loans\n(0.02)\n%\n(0.02)\n%\n(0.05)\n%\nConsumer credit card\n4.04 \n%\n3.58 \n%\n2.72 \n%\nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n(3.88)\n%\n12.79 \n%\n1.75 \n%\nOther consumer\n2.71 \n%\n2.74 \n%\n2.99 \n%\nTotal\n0.47 \n%\n0.40 \n%\n0.29 \n%\nRatios \n(2)\n:\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period to loans, net of unearned income \n1.79 \n%\n1.73 \n%\n1.63 \n%\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period to non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale\n186 \n%\n211 \n%\n317 \n%\n_______\n(1)\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n(2)\nAmounts have been calculated using whole dollar values.\nNet charge-offs increased $61 million year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in commercial and industrial and commercial investor real estate mortgage net charge-offs, and partially offset by a decline in net charge-offs in exit portfolios.

The balance at December 31, 2024 totaled $1.6 billion, increasing from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase of investments in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock. Refer to Note 7 \"Other Earning Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AT FAIR VALUE\nResidential MSRs increased approximately $101 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a bulk purchase of the rights to service $8 billion of residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting the increase was higher amortization of servicing rights. An analysis of residential MSRs is presented in Note 6 \"Servicing of Financial Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements. \nOTHER ASSETS\nOther assets increased $646 million to $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to Regions' Early Pay program which provides customers access to their payroll funds up to two days in advance. Also contributing was an increase in a receivable related to the sale of commercial loans held for sale which fluctuates based on the timing of sale and subsequent settlement, as well as an increase in investments in economic development projects.\nDEPOSITS\nRegions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions’ ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers’ needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services through the Company's digital channels and contact center.\n73\nTable of Contents\n \nDeposits are Regions’ primary source of funds, providing funding for 92 percent of average earning assets in both 2024 and 2023. Table 21 \"Deposits by Category and by Segment\" details year-over-year deposit balance changes on a period-ending basis.  \nThe following table summarizes deposits by category and by segment as of December 31:\nTable 21—Deposits by Category and by Segment\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nNon-interest-bearing demand\n$\n39,138 \n$\n42,368 \nInterest-bearing checking\n25,079 \n24,480 \nSavings\n12,022 \n12,604 \nMoney market—domestic\n35,644 \n33,364 \nTime deposits\n15,720 \n14,972 \n$\n127,603 \n$\n127,788 \nConsumer Bank segment\n$\n78,637 \n$\n80,031 \nCorporate Bank segment\n38,361 \n36,883 \nWealth Management segment\n7,736 \n7,694 \nOther\n(1)\n2,869 \n3,180 \n$\n127,603 \n$\n127,788 \n____\n(1)   Other deposits represent non-customer balances primarily consisting of wholesale funding (for example, selected deposits and brokered time deposits). Other deposits include brokered deposits totaling $2.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2023.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2024 decreased approximately $185 million compared to year-end 2023 levels. Growth in corporate and wealth deposits were overcome by declines in consumer and other deposits. As expected, deposit balances were further impacted by the remixing experienced in 2023, albeit at a slower pace. Non-interest-bearing demand and savings accounts that provide a lower or no interest rate decreased in 2024 while categories that provide a higher interest rate to customers, such as money market and time deposits, grew in 2024. The pace of remixing slowed in the second half of 2024 as competitive rates declined ahead of the reduction in the Fed funds rate in the third quarter and continued with 2 additional rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024. Overall the non-interest-bearing mix has remained mostly stable at approximately 31 percent of total deposits at year-end 2024 compared to 33 percent at year-end 2023. \nThe deposit mix influenced an increase in deposit costs to 156 basis points for 2024, compared to 99 basis points for 2023. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 228 basis points for 2024 compared to 156 basis points for 2023. See the “Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk” section for further discussion of these balances. \nRegions' deposits are granular and diversified including insured and collateralized deposits, with consumer deposits making up more than 62 percent of the total deposit base. Furthermore, corporate deposits include those that are operational in nature (where the primary use is certain operational services such as clearing, custody, payments or other cash management activities). A significant amount of the Company's deposit base is insured by the FDIC or collateralized, with approximately $10.7 billion in deposits collateralized in public funds or in trusts at December 31, 2024. The amount of estimated uninsured deposits totaled $49.9 billion at December 31, 2024, therefore over 60 percent of total deposits were insured by the FDIC. The granularity of the Company's deposits was also evidenced by an average deposit account balance of approximately $18 thousand at December 31, 2024. The estimates of uninsured deposits and average account size were based on methodologies used in the Company's Call Report, which is prepared on an unconsolidated bank basis.\nSee the \"Liquidity\" and \"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk\" sections for further discussion on liquidity and interest rates.\nTime deposit accounts with balances of $250,000 or more totaled $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe following table shows scheduled maturities of estimated uninsured time deposits as of December 31, 2024:\nTable 22—Maturity of Uninsured Time Deposits \n2024\n \n(In millions)\nUninsured time deposits, maturing in:\n3 months or less\n$\n726 \nOver 3 through 6 months\n630 \nOver 6 through 12 months\n155 \nOver 12 months\n94 \n$\n1,605 \n74\nTable of Contents\n \nBORROWED FUNDS\nTotal short-term borrowings increased from zero at December 31, 2023 to $500 million at December 31, 2024 due to the use of FHLB advances. The levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the sources utilized. Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, are a portion of Regions' funding strategy. See the \"Liquidity\" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.\nTotal long-term borrowings increased approximately $3.7 billion to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024 due to the use of FHLB borrowings and debt issuances during the second and third quarters of 2024. \nSee Note 11 \"Borrowed Funds\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of both short-term and long-term borrowings. \nRATINGS\n    Table 23 \"Credit Ratings\" reflects the debt ratings information of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank by S&P, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS.\nTable 23—Credit Ratings\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nS&P\nMoody’s\nFitch\nDBRS \n(1)\nRegions Financial Corporation\nSenior unsecured debt\nBBB+\nBaa1\nA-\nA\nSubordinated debt\nBBB\nBaa1\nBBB+\nWR\nRegions Bank\nShort-term \nA-2\nP-1\nF1\nR-1M\nLong-term bank deposits \nN/A\nA1\nA\nAH\nSenior unsecured debt\nA-\nBaa1\nA-\nAH\nSubordinated debt\nBBB+\nBaa1\nBBB+\nA\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nStable\n____\n(1)    As of March 31, 2024, DBRS withdrew their rating on Regions Financial Corporation's subordinated debt.\nOn September 16, 2024, Moody's affirmed the Company's senior unsecured debt rating and revised its outlook to stable from negative citing its very strong deposit franchise, sound profitability and conservative asset risk profile.\nIn general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions’ access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions’ financial condition and liquidity. See “Risk Factors” for more information.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.\nSHAREHOLDERS' AND TOTAL EQUITY\nShareholders’ equity was $17.9 billion at December 31, 2024 as compared to $17.4 billion at December 31, 2023. During 2024, net income increased shareholders' equity by $1.9 billion, cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $895 million. Cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $104 million. Changes in AOCI decreased shareholders' equity by $116 million, primarily due to available for sale securities and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued Series F preferred stock, which increased shareholders' equity by $489 million and redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, which decreased shareholders' equity by $500 million. Common stock repurchased during 2024 decreased shareholders' equity by $348 million. These shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The cumulative effect from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the accounting for tax credit investments decreased shareholders' equity by $5 million. See Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements for information.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, the Company purchased 3.4 million shares for approximately $82 million through February 20, 2025. These shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock.\n75\nTable of Contents\n \nTotal equity included noncontrolling interest of $31 million and $64 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The noncontrolling interest represents the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which Regions held the majority interest at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nSee Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" section for additional information.\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS \nCAPITAL RULES\nRegions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Regions is a \"Category IV\" institution under the Federal Reserve's Tailoring Rules. \nFederal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2022 and will conclude in the first quarter of 2025. At December 31, 2024, the net impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $102 million or approximately 8 basis points. \nRegions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, proposals were issued by the U.S federal banking regulators that, if adopted, would impact the Company related to long-term debt requirements and U.S. implementation of capital requirements under Basel IV rules, more recently referred to as the Basel III \"Endgame\". The Company is studying the proposals and evaluating their impacts. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the \"Supervision and Regulation\" subsection of the \"Business\" section.\nAdditional discussion and a tabular presentation of the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements is included in Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY\nRegions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions’ Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with Regions’ operating model and risk profile.\n See the “Supervision and Regulation—Liquidity Regulation” subsection of the “Business” section, the \"Risk Factors\" section and the \"Liquidity\" section for more information.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRegions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of operations. The exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that apply to the entire Company. Accordingly, Regions has established a risk management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives.\nThe primary risk exposures identified and managed through the Company’s risk management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk.\n•\nMarket risk is the risk to the Company’s financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices.\n•\nLiquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as \"funding liquidity risk\") or the potential that the \n76\nTable of Contents\n \nCompany cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (referred to as \"market liquidity risk\").\n•\nCredit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation.\n•\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.\n•\nLegal risk is defined as the risk associated with the failure to meet Regions' legal obligations from legislative, regulatory, or contractual perspectives.\n•\nCompliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards.\n•\nReputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.\n•\nStrategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment.\nSeveral of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nRegions’ risk management framework outlines the Company’s approach for managing risk that includes the following four components:\n•\nCollaborative Risk Culture\n - A strong, collaborative risk culture is fundamental to the Company's core values and operating principles. It ensures focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within the bounds of the Company’s risk appetite. The Company's risk culture requires that risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged; thereby, benefiting the overall performance of the Company. Sustaining a collaborative risk culture is critical to the Company's success and is a clear expectation of executive management and the Board.\n•\nSound Risk Appetite\n - The Company's risk appetite statements define the types and levels of risk the Company is willing to take to achieve its objectives.\n•\nSustainable Risk Processes\n - Effective risk management requires sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risk.\n•\nResponsible Risk Governance \n- Governance serves as the foundation for comprehensive management of risks facing the Company. It outlines clear responsibility and accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both existing and emerging risks.\nClearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective management of risk and are central to the four components of the Company’s approach to risk management. Regions utilizes the Three Lines of Defense concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the Company.\n•\n1st Line of Defense activities include the proactive identification, management (including mitigation and risk acceptance), and ownership of risks.\n•\n2nd Line of Defense activities provide for objective oversight of the Company’s risk-taking activities and assessment of the Company’s aggregate risk levels.\n•\n3rd Line of Defense activities provide for independent reviews and assessments of risk management practices across the Company.\nThe Board provides the highest level of risk management governance. The principal risk management functions of the Board are to oversee processes for evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. The Board has designated an Audit Committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. See the \"Financial Disclosures and Internal Controls\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information. The Board has also designated a Risk Committee of outside directors to focus on Regions’ overall risk profile. The Risk Committee annually approves an Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement that reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk type. This statement is designed to be a high-level document that sets the tone for the Board’s risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, customers and other stakeholders, the Company’s risk appetite is aligned with its strategic priorities and goals.\n77\nTable of Contents\n \nThe Risk Management Group, led by the Company’s Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistent application of Regions’ risk management approach within the structure of the Company’s operating, capital and strategic plans. The primary activities of the Risk Management Group include:\n•\nInterpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues for the Company;\n•\nIdentifying risks and determining which Company areas and/or products will be affected;\n•\nEnsuring there are mechanisms in place to specifically determine how risks will affect the Company as a whole and the individual area and or product;\n•\nAssisting business groups in analyzing trends and ensuring Company areas have appropriate risk identification and mitigation processes in place; and\n•\nReviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure the continued appropriateness of risk controls.\nAs part of its ongoing assessment process, the Risk Management Group makes recommendations to management and the Risk Committee of the Board regarding adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Company’s internal control structure and related systems and processes.\nManagement, with the assistance of the Risk Management Group, follows a formal process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated, as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. The Risk Committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are within the limits established by the Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement.\nSome of the more significant processes used by management to manage and control risks are described in the remainder of this report.  External factors beyond management’s control may result in losses despite the Risk Management Group’s efforts.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. While the implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of total assets and deposits in the banking industry and the resulting level of profitability and capitalization. Inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and therefore, the pricing of financial instruments.\nManagement believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of Regions’ ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. The Company’s interest rate risk positioning was mostly neutral as of December 31, 2024, and therefore, net interest income increases or declines only modestly from higher or lower interest rates. Hedging activity has reduced the exposure to net interest income late in the rising interest rate cycle as intended. Refer to Table 24 \"Interest Rate Sensitivity\" for additional details on Regions’ interest rate sensitivity.\nAdditionally, inflation has the potential to impact credit risk. Periods of inflation could influence asset prices and business input costs which could affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. The Company has sound credit risk management practices to maintain a credit portfolio through the economic cycle. Refer to the \"Credit Risk\" section for further details on Regions' credit risk management process. \nEFFECTS OF DEFLATION\nA period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial institutions. Deflation potentially could lead to lower profits, higher unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions. In addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans. \nManagement believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to Regions’ ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses. However, the Company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop.\nMARKET RISK—INTEREST RATE RISK \nRegions’ primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. As its primary tool to analyze this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions’ interest rate risk.\n78\nTable of Contents\n \nIn addition to net interest income simulations, Regions also utilizes an EVE analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longer-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Importantly, EVE values only the current balance sheet, excluding the growth assumptions used in net interest income sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the results are highly dependent on assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities. The uncertainty surrounding important assumptions used in EVE analysis may limit its efficacy.\nSensitivity Measurement\n—Financial simulation models are Regions’ primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions’ balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.\nThe primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using “market forward rates.” The set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes. In addition to parallel rate shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements.\nExposure to Interest Rate Movements\n—Regions' balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive, with net interest income  increasing with higher interest rates, and decreasing with lower interest rates. This is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices, and funding from a large, mostly stable retail deposit portfolio.  Importantly, the stability and rate sensitivity of Regions' deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles. With this natural balance sheet profile, the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through derivative hedges is critical in mitigating the Bank’s naturally asset sensitive position. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Regions evidenced a mostly balanced, or \"neutral\" asset/liability position, with an asset duration of approximately 2.5 years and a liability duration of approximately 2.4 years, using historically-informed approximations. While the derivative hedging portfolio and securities portfolio have been recorded on the balance sheet at an unrealized loss, deposit value increases more than offset this loss during the rising rate cycle. The additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment is realized in the form of lower-cost funding when compared with wholesale sources. While balance sheet analysis, particularly EVE analysis, does contemplate the economic value of deposits, the estimated fair value of deposits is equal to their carrying value for certain financial statement footnote disclosures, consistent with industry practices. See Note 21 \"Fair Value Measurements\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRecently, pay-fixed fair value hedges and securities transfers from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity classification have been used to reduce AOCI volatility associated with unrealized securities gains and losses. Inclusive of these activities, the total securities portfolio duration is 4.5 years, the available-for-sale securities portfolio duration is 4.2 years, and the held-to-maturity securities portfolio duration is 5.9 years. As pay-fixed fair value hedges are further utilized to manage AOCI volatility, receive-fixed cash flow hedges may be entered as an offset to preserve Regions’ interest rate sensitivity.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, Regions' net interest income profile was mostly neutral to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending December 2025. The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in Table 24 below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the interest rate on reserve balances, and SOFR) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. In either scenario, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will offset the change in asset yields, resulting in little change to net interest income.\nNet interest income remains exposed to intermediate and long-term yield curve tenors. While this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment, it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth given higher interest rates today. Elevated, or increasing intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swaps and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed-rate, newly originated or renewed loans, and increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases. The opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall.  Additionally, shifts in the long end of the yield curve will impact securities prepayments and alter the amount of discount accretion and premium amortization in any given period.\n79\nTable of Contents\n \nThe interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 24 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity, management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered predictive of future results.\nThe Company’s baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming 12 months. Deposit balances and mix have mostly reverted to normal historical patterns and trends. Additional deposit balance outflow of $1 billion would reduce net interest income by $19 million over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 24. Conversely, if an additional $1 billion are retained, a positive benefit of $19 million would be expected over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 24.\nIn rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Currently, however, much of the anticipated mix shift has already occurred or is expected to occur within the baseline scenario, mitigating the amount of additional remixing in higher rate scenarios. The magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $1.1 billion over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 24. Furthermore, over the 12 month horizon, an increase of $1 billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately $24 million, and a decrease of $1 billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by $24 million in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario.\nThe interest-bearing deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. The parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point shock scenario in Table 24 incorporates an incremental beta between 40 and 45 percent when compared to the base case scenario, while the parallel, instantaneous -100 basis point shock scenario incorporates an incremental beta between 35 and 40 percent when compared to the base case scenario. Incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of 5 percent in a parallel, instantaneous 100 basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $43 million.\nThe table below summarizes Regions' positioning over the next 12 months in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 25 and its accompanying description.  \nTable 24—Interest Rate Sensitivity \nEstimated Annual Change\nin Net Interest Income\nDecember 31, 2024\n(1)(2)\n \n(In millions)\nGradual Change in Interest Rates\n+ 200 basis points\n$\n46 \n+ 100 basis points\n27 \n - 100 basis points\n(41)\n - 200 basis points\n(80)\nInstantaneous Change in Interest Rates\n+ 200 basis points\n$\n(36)\n+ 100 basis points\n(9)\n- 100 basis points\n(24)\n - 200 basis points\n(49)\n________\n(1)\nDisclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12-month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing.\n(2)\nActive hedges, including forward starting hedges, are included in the sensitivity analysis to the extent that they fall within the measurement horizon.\nRegions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position. \nInterest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions’ securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders’ equity.\nDerivatives\n—Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions’ senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions \n80\nTable of Contents\n \nemploys are forward rate contracts, forward sale commitments, futures contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate options (caps, floors and collars), and contracts with a combination of these instruments. \nForward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform.\nRegions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing. \nThe following table presents additional information about hedging interest rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:\nTable 25—Hedging Derivatives by Interest Rate Risk Management Strategy\nDecember 31, 2024\nNotional\nAmount\nWeighted-Average \nMaturity (Years)\nReceive Rate\nPay Rate\n(Dollars in millions)\nDerivatives in fair value hedging relationships:\nReceive variable/pay fixed swaps - debt securities available for sale\n(1)(2)(3)\n$\n2,334 \n5.2 \n4.4 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nReceive fixed/pay variable swaps - borrowings and time deposits\n(3)\n3,150 \n4.9 \n2.3 \n%\n4.3 \n%\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationships:\nReceive fixed/pay variable swaps - floating-rate loans\n(1)(2)(3)\n$\n36,660 \n3.2 \n3.1 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n   Interest rate options\n(4)\n2,000 \n3.5 \nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments\n$\n44,144 \n_________\n(1)\nFloating rates represent the most recent fixing for active derivatives and the first forward fixing for future starting derivatives.  \n(2)\nIncludes forward starting notional with maturity relative to current quarter-end. For more information on notional by year, see Table 26.\n(3)\nAll floating rates are SOFR based and may include SOFR conversion spread. \n(4)\nInterest rate options have an average cap strike of  6.22% and a floor of  1.86%. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company added $3.0 billion in forward-starting interest rate swaps (floating rate loan hedges) with a receive rate of 3.6 percent, which will become active in both July 2026 and July 2028 and mature in July 2031. The Company also added $2.0 billion in pay-fixed interest rate swaps (AFS securities hedges) with an average pay rate of 3.9 percent and an average maturity in 2030 to reduce AOCI volatility in the AFS securities portfolio. As an offset to the interest rate risk associated with these pay-fixed fair value hedges, the Company added $2.0 billion in spot-starting receive-fixed interest rate swaps (floating rate loan hedges) with an average receive rate of 3.8 percent and an average maturity in 2030. Cash flow swaps (floating rate loan hedges) typically have a different day count convention than fair value swaps (AFS securities hedges), resulting in a lower fixed rate.\n81\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table presents the average asset hedge notional amounts that are active during each of the remaining quarterly and annual periods. \nTable 26—Schedule of Notional for Asset Hedging Derivatives\nAverage Active Notional Amount\nQuarter Ended\nYears Ended\n12/31/2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n(In millions)\nAsset Hedging Relationships:\nReceive fixed/pay variable swaps\n$\n19,421 \n$\n20,998 \n$\n20,175 \n$\n18,707 \n$\n14,177 \n$\n9,226 \n$\n7,850 \n$\n3,228 \n$\n470 \n$\n350 \n$\n217 \nReceive variable/pay fixed swaps\n803 \n2,310 \n2,259 \n2,025 \n1,721 \n1,363 \n623 \n623 \n472 \n350 \n217 \nNet receive fixed/pay variable swaps\n$\n18,618 \n$\n18,688 \n$\n17,916 \n$\n16,682 \n$\n12,456 \n$\n7,863 \n$\n7,227 \n$\n2,605 \n$\n(2)\n$\n— \n$\n— \nInterest rate options\n$\n1,500 \n$\n1,999 \n$\n2,000 \n$\n2,000 \n$\n999 \n$\n1 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n_________\n(1)\nActive hedges, including forward-starting hedges, are included in the sensitivity levels disclosed in Table 24 to the extent that they fall within the measurement horizon.\nRegions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. Most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The “Credit Risk” section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk.\nRegions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe primary objective of Regions’ hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions’ execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. \nSee Note 20 \"Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions’ year-end derivatives positions and further discussion.\nRegions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions’ current portfolio.\nLIQUIDITY \nLiquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions’ ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers. Regions’ goal in liquidity management is to maintain diverse liquidity sources and reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further described below. See also Note 23 \"Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company’s funding requirements. Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk. \n Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans, and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by Regions' deposit base. \n82\nTable of Contents\n \nCash reserves, liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation. As part of its normal management practice, Regions maintains collateral and operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank on a same-day basis (subject to any practical constraints affecting these market participants). While the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity, the secured borrowing capabilities, in addition to cash reserves on hand, assist in alleviating the Company's need to sell securities for funding purposes. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such markets. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's available sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2024:\nTable 27—Liquidity Sources\nAvailability as of December 31, 2024\n(In billions)\nCash at the Federal Reserve Bank\n(1)\n$\n7.8 \nUnencumbered investment securities\n(2)\n23.1\nFHLB borrowing availability\n10.2\nFederal Reserve Bank borrowing availability through the discount window\n21.6\nTotal liquidity sources\n$\n62.7 \n____\n(1)  Includes small in transit items that may not yet be reflected in the Federal Reserve Bank master account closing balance. \n(2)  Unencumbered investment securities comprise securities that are eligible as collateral for secured transactions through market channels or are eligible to be pledged to the FHLB, the Federal Reserve discount window, or the Standing Repo Facility.\nThe balance with the Federal Reserve Bank is the primary component of the balance sheet line item “interest-bearing deposits in other banks.” At December 31, 2024, Regions had approximately $7.8 billion in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and other depository institutions, an increase from approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, 2023, driven by incremental secured and unsecured borrowing to optimize liquidity.\nThe securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 3 \"Debt Securities\" to the consolidated financial statements). Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the available for sale securities portfolio (for example, the agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements. Regions' securities portfolio consists of residential and commercial agency MBS, U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency securities, and corporate and other debt. In evaluating the liquidity within the securities portfolio, unencumbered investment securities are primarily comprised of U.S Treasury securities and residential and commercial agency MBS. Unencumbered investment securities also includes certain corporate bonds considered to be highly liquid and other securities, primarily non-agency commercial MBS.\nRegions’ financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of December 31, 2024, Regions had $500 million in short-term FHLB borrowings, $2.0 billion in long-term FHLB borrowings and had borrowing capacity as shown in Table 27. FHLB borrowing capacity was determined based on eligible securities and loan amounts, as of December 31, 2024, that were pledged as collateral for future borrowing capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding.\nRegions has additional borrowing availability with the Federal Reserve Bank through the discount window as shown in Table 27. Federal Reserve Bank borrowing capacity is determined based on eligible loan amounts that were pledged as collateral for future borrowing capacity. Also through the Federal Reserve Bank, Regions is an eligible Standing Repo Facility counterparty, which supplements Regions' available channels for monetizing unencumbered securities.\nRegions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. Refer to Note 11 \"Borrowed Funds\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nRegions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nRegions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company exceeded minimums and totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2024. Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the \n83\nTable of Contents\n \nBoard through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits.\nMARKET RISK—PREPAYMENT RISK \nRegions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income. For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a borrower, so that the borrower may refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions’ interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions’ greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its MBS portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSRs. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management.\nCREDIT RISK\nRegions’ objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the \"Portfolio Characteristics\" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type. \nManagement Process\nCredit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken are aligned with Regions' credit risk appetite.  The credit quality of borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on Regions' earnings; however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and consumer lending.  Regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making.  Credit policies, another key component of Regions' culture, are designed and adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. These policies guide lending activities in a manner consistent with Regions' strategy and provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives.  \nEffective credit risk management requires coordinated identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure, credit quality, and emerging risk trends. Accordingly, Regions has implemented a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the Board to the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication.\nOccasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations and Regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses.  Teams are in place to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. Regions maintains an allowance for credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses in the portfolio.\nFor a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses refer to the “Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies” section found earlier in this report, Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements. Details regarding the allowance for credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year’s total, are included in Table 17 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\". Also, refer to Table 18 \"Allowance Allocation\" for details pertaining to management’s allocation of the allowance to each loan category.\nResponsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks, including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line of defense. Risk Management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. Finally, Credit Risk Review provides ongoing oversight, as a third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure Regions’ activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the Company.\n84\nTable of Contents\n \nCounterparty Risk\nCounterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal obligations. Exposure may be to a financial institution (such as a commercial bank, an insurance company, a broker dealer, etc.) or a corporate client.\nRegions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of counterparty exposure. The Counterparty Risk Management Group is responsible for the independent credit risk management of financial institution counterparties and their affiliates. Market Risk Management is responsible for the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. The Corporate and Commercial Credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk management of client side counterparties.\nFinancial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types generated in one or more departments of the Company. Aggregate exposure limits are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the Company. Counterparty client credit risk arises when Regions sells a risk management product to hedge risks in the client’s business. Exposures to counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management.\nINFORMATION SECURITY RISK\nRegions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems. In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. \nSee Part I, Item 1C. \nCybersecurity\n found earlier in this report for further information.\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS\nRegions maintains internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Regions’ process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective. These risks, control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format. This format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective.\nRegions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. These controls and procedures as defined by the SEC are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nRegions’ Disclosure Review Committee, which includes representatives from the legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the CEO and CFO meet quarterly with the SEC Filings Review Committee, which includes senior representatives from accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. The SEC Filings Review Committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose to the CEO and CFO any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Regions’ internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the Company’s Form 10-K and 10-Q filings are accurate, complete, and timely. As part of this process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from Regions’ associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring effective internal controls over financial reporting. These certifications are reviewed and presented to the CEO and CFO as support of the Company’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. The Form 10-K is presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for approval, and the Forms 10-Q are reviewed by the Audit Committee. Financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\nAs required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the CEO and the CFO review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of Regions’ periodic public reports filed with the SEC, as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. With the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the previous paragraph, Regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and makes refinements as necessary.\nCOMPARISON OF 2023 WITH 2022\nRefer to the “2023 Results” and \"Operating Results\" sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for comparisons of 2023 with 2022.\n85\nTable of Contents",
