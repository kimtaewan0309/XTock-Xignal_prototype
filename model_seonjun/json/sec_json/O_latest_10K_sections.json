Founded in 1969, we invest in diversified commercial real estate and as of December 31, 2024, have a portfolio of over 15,600 properties in all 50 states of the United States (\"U.S.\"), the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), and six other countries in Europe. We are known as “The Monthly Dividend Company\n®\n” and have a mission to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. Since our founding, we have declared 656 consecutive monthly dividends and are a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats\n®\n index for having increased our dividend for the last 30 consecutive years. \nOver the past 56 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients. We are structured as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") requiring us annually to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to our stockholders. \nOn January 23, 2024, we closed on our merger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (\"Spirit\", formerly NYSE: SRC), which is further described in note\n \n2\n, Merger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc.\n,\n to the consolidated financial statements. The Spirit portfolio consisted of 2,018 U.S. retail, industrial, and other properties across 49 states. This transaction enhanced the diversification and depth our real estate portfolio and allowed us to strengthen our longstanding relationships with existing clients and curate new ones. \nBUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY\nWe believe that actively managing a diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.\nDiversification is a key component of our investment philosophy. We believe that diversification of the portfolio by client, industry, geography, and property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration. Our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio and as of December 31, 2024, we owned or held interests in 15,621 properties located in all 50 U.S. states, the U.K., France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain\n \nwith clients doing business in 89 industries. \nAs we look to continue to expand our platform globally, we focus upon building relationships with new multinational clients that seek a real estate partner with an expanding geographic footprint.\nInvestment Strategy\nWe seek to acquire, invest in and develop high-quality real estate that our clients consider important to the successful operation of their businesses. We generally seek to own or hold interests in commercial real estate that has some or all of the following characteristics:\n•\nProperties in markets or locations important to our clients;\n•\nProperties with strong demographic attributes or that we deem to be profitable for our clients; \n•\nProperties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs;\n•\nProperties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents for similar properties; \n•\nProperties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases;\n2\nTable of \nContents\n•\nProperties that leverage relationships with clients, sellers, investors, or developers as part of a long-term strategy; and\n•\nProperties that leverage our proprietary insights, including those in locations and geographic markets we expect to remain strong or strengthen in the future.\nWe typically seek to invest in properties or portfolios of properties owned or leased by clients that are already or could become leaders in their respective businesses supported by mechanisms including (but not limited to) occupancy of prime real estate locations, pricing, merchandise assortment, service, quality, economies of scale, consumer branding, e-commerce, and advertising. We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our relationships with various clients, owners/developers, brokers, and advisers to uncover and secure transactions. We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations, clients, and industries for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering investment opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value.\nIn selecting potential investments, we generally look for clients with the following attributes:\n•\nReliable and sustainable cash flow, including demonstrated economic resiliency;\n•\nRevenue and cash flow from multiple sources;\n•\nAre willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and\n•\nAre large owners and users of real estate.\nFrom a retail perspective, our investment strategy is to target clients that have a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price-point component to their business. We target investments with clients who have demonstrated resiliency to e-commerce or have a strong omnichannel retail strategy, uniting brick-and-mortar and mobile browsing, both of which reflect the continued importance of last mile retail, the movement of goods to their final destination, real estate as part of a customer experience and supply chain strategy. Our overall investments (including last mile retail) are driven by an optimal portfolio strategy that, among other considerations, targets allocation ranges by asset class and industry. We review our strategy periodically and stress test our portfolio in a variety of positive and negative economic scenarios to ensure we deliver consistent earnings growth and value creation across economic cycles. As a result of the execution of this strategy, approximately 91% of our annualized retail contractual rent on\n \nDecember 31, 2024, is derived from our clients with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties.\nAfter applying this investment strategy, we pursue those transactions where we believe we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to evaluate all investments for consistency with our objective of owning net lease assets.\nUnderwriting Strategy\nTo be considered for acquisition, investments must meet stringent underwriting requirements. We analyze investments based on one or more of the following criteria:\n•\nIndustry, client (including credit), and market conditions;\n•\nExpected financial returns under various scenarios (including default);\n•\nThe value of real estate (based on replacement cost, comparative rental rates and alternative uses), or other collateral backing the client’s contractual obligations; and\n•\nStore profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available or the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the clients’ business. \nWith regard to real estate investments, we typically own the land and building in which a client conducts its business or which are critical to the client’s ability to generate revenue. It has been our experience that clients must retain their profitable and critical locations to survive. Therefore, in the event of reorganization, we believe they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property.\nThus, as the property owner, we believe that we should fare better than unsecured creditors of the same client in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by our client during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new client or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of our clients’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition.\n3\nTable of \nContents\nWe conduct comprehensive reviews of the business segments and industries in which our clients operate. In addition, prior to entering into any transaction, our credit research team conducts a review of a client’s credit quality. The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization, and other financial metrics. We conduct due diligence, including financial reviews of the client, monitor our clients’ credit quality on an ongoing basis, and provide summaries of these findings to management. \nAt December 31, 2024, 32.4% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent (as defined in \"Property Portfolio Information\"\n \nbelow) comes from properties leased to our investment grade clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies. At December 31, 2024, our top 20 clients (based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent) represented 36.4% of our annualized rent and 10 of these clients have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies.\nAsset Management Strategy\nIn addition to pursuing new properties for investment, we seek to increase earnings and dividends through active asset management.\nGenerally, our asset management efforts seek to achieve: \n•\nRent increases during and at the expiration of existing leases, when market conditions permit;\n•\nOptimum exposure to certain clients, industries, and markets through re-leasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties;\n•\nMaximum asset-level returns on properties that are renewed, re-leased or sold; and\n•\nAdditional value creation opportunities from the existing portfolio by leveraging internal capabilities to enhance individual properties, pursue alternative uses, and derive ancillary revenue.\nAs part of our ongoing credit and predictive analytics research, we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our clients, our clients’ industries, and the real estate locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality. \nOur disposition strategy remains a function of our active investment management approach, supported by several data-driven tools, and aims at further enhancing our portfolio and maximizing portfolio returns through the sale of select assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:\n•\nGenerate higher returns;\n•\nEnhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;\n•\nExtend our average remaining lease term; and/or\n•\nStrategically decrease client, industry, or geographic concentration.\nThe active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy of maintaining high occupancy.\nCapital Philosophy\nA primary objective of Realty Income is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time. To achieve this goal, we make a variety of capital allocation decisions, including with respect to our investments, leasing and releasing terms, and property development among other capital expenditures. We fund these expenditures by utilizing internally generated cash flow, dispositions, debt and equity issuances and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should represent the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price supports accretive deployment of proceeds into additional properties, to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities, and to repay or refinance debt. In addition, we continue to explore capital diversification initiatives, including the establishment of a fund business which we believe has the potential to expand our alternatives for sources of future capital. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to these sources of capital at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us. \nHuman Capital \nWe put great effort into cultivating an inclusive company culture. We seek to hire talented employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and look to foster an environment that allows for regular, open communication where capable team members have fulfilling careers and are encouraged to engage with and make a positive impact on our Company, its operations, its business partners, and the communities in which we operate. \n4\nTable of \nContents\nEmployees operate as \"One Team\" and, together, we are committed to providing an engaging work environment centered on our values of:\n•\nDo the Right Thing, \n•\nTake Ownership, \n•\nEmpower Each Other, \n•\nCelebrate Differences, and \n•\nGive More than We Take. \nRecruitment, Development and Retention\nAt the heart of our corporate culture lie our dedicated employees, who form the foundation of our organization, representing our most valuable assets. As of December 31, 2024, our workforce comprises 468 professionals. The majority of our talented team members are recruited and hired from the communities in which we operate, embodying our commitment to local engagement. To extend the scope of our talent acquisition efforts, we have implemented various initiatives, including college and high school internship programs. Our comprehensive approach encompasses a wide range of strategies, such as engaging with affinity associations, and fostering employee referrals. These measures ensure that we continually attract and embrace a diverse pool of candidates. Furthermore, we recognize that internal mobility within our organization unlocks yet another great source of talent. By encouraging our current employees to expand their skills and take on new challenges, we tap into a rich reservoir of potential that enhances our workforce's capabilities and reinforces our corporate culture. \nWe offer leadership development programs and train on critical topics such as ethics, insider trading, anti-discrimination and harassment, anti-bribery, consumer privacy, cybersecurity, workplace violence prevention, safety, and other Company policies. We provide professional development opportunities for One Team members and provide assistance and support to employees who are pursuing job-related licenses, certifications, and continuing education.  \nEmployee retention is essential for supporting a positive culture and productive workforce. Accordingly, we believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages. Benefits include medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and their families, 401(k) or equivalent plans with Company matching opportunity; paid time-off or equivalent vacation; disability and life insurance; and, in years that the Company's performance meets certain goals, the ability to earn equity in the Company subject to applicable vesting periods.   \nAdditional information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives is available in our annual Proxy Statement and Sustainability Report, both of which can be found on our website. Information on our website, including our Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into this annual report.\nEmployee Health, Safety and Wellbeing\nWe prioritize the health, safety, and wellbeing of our team members. Our wellbeing program is thoughtfully designed to empower employees by fostering personal and professional growth through engaging activities and educational initiatives. Centered around five key pillars—purpose, social connection, financial health, community engagement, and physical wellness—our program provides a holistic approach to enhancing overall wellbeing. In fostering a healthy work environment, we promote work-life balance by offering flexible schedules and providing discounted fitness programs, paid family leave, parental leave, onsite lactation rooms, an infant-at-work program, employee health fairs, and an employee assistance program, among other programs and services. \nGovernment Regulation\nGeneral\nCompliance with various governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with applicable federal, international, state and local governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, U.S. federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations, data privacy laws and regulations, sanctions restrictions, foreign laws and regulations, gaming laws and regulations and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (\"ADA\"). We believe that our properties generally have the necessary permits and approvals needed and are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.\n5\nTable of \nContents\nEnvironmental Matters\nInvestments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. While our tenants are generally primarily responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we as the property owner have faced and can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination; the timing of the contamination; the cause of the contamination; or the party responsible for the contamination of the property.\nSome of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near properties that contain or have contained storage tanks for petroleum products or that involve or involved the use of hazardous or toxic substances. Under certain laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant may be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases, and may be held liable to a government entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the contamination. The liability may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations.\nEnvironmental laws also govern asbestos-containing materials (“ACM”). Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations, and we could be subject to lawsuits if personal injury from exposure to ACM occurs. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. In addition, our properties have contained and may contain in the future or develop harmful mold or other airborne contaminants. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties has required us to and could require us to undertake in the future costly remediation to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. Further, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a corporate website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, and other reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC. None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of this report.\nPROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION\nAt December 31, 2024, most of the properties in our portfolio were leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients' gross sales above a specified level.\nWe define total portfolio annualized contractual rent as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables, as of the balance sheet date, multiplied by 12, excluding percentage rent, interest income on loans and preferred equity investments, and including our pro rata share of such revenues from properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe total portfolio annualized contractual rent is a \nuseful supplemental operating measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Total portfolio annualized contractual rent has not been reduced to reflect reserves recorded as adjustments to rental revenue under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (\"U.S. GAAP\") in the periods presented.\nTop 10 Industry Concentrations\nWe are engaged in a single business activity, which is the leasing of property to clients, generally on a net basis. That business activity spans various geographic boundaries and includes property types and clients engaged in various industries. Even though we have a single segment, we believe our investors continue to view diversification as a key component of our investment philosophy and so we believe it remains important to present certain information regarding our property portfolio classified according to the business of the respective clients, expressed as a percentage of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent:\nPercentage of Total Portfolio Annualized Contractual Rent by Industry\nAs of\nDec 31,\n2024\nDec 31,\n2023\nDec 31,\n2022\nDec 31,\n2021\nDec 31,\n2020\nConvenience Stores\n10.2%\n10.2%\n8.6%\n9.1%\n11.9%\nGrocery\n10.1\n11.4\n10.0\n10.2\n9.8\nDollar Stores\n6.4\n7.1\n7.4\n7.5\n7.6\nHome Improvement\n6.0\n5.9\n5.6\n5.1\n4.3\nRestaurants-Quick Service\n4.9\n5.2\n6.0\n6.6\n5.3\nDrug Stores\n4.7\n5.5\n5.7\n6.6\n8.2\nAutomotive Service\n4.5\n4.3\n4.0\n3.2\n2.7\nHealth and Fitness\n4.3\n3.9\n4.4\n4.7\n6.7\nRestaurants-Casual Dining\n4.0\n4.4\n5.1\n5.9\n2.8\nGaming\n3.2\n3.9\n2.9\n—\n—\nProperty Type Composition\nThe following table sets forth certain property type information regarding our property portfolio as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nProperty Type\nNumber of\nProperties\nApproximate\nLeasable\nSquare Feet \n(1)\nTotal Portfolio Annualized Contractual Rent\nPercentage of Total Portfolio Annualized Contractual Rent\nRetail\n14,983\n213,026,200\n$\n3,944,534 \n79.4 \n%\nIndustrial\n566\n116,138,200\n722,251 \n14.5 \nGaming\n2\n5,053,400\n160,854 \n3.2 \nOther \n(2)\n70\n5,154,100\n143,185 \n2.9 \nTotal\n15,621\n339,371,900\n$\n4,970,824 \n100.0 \n%\n(1)\nRepresents leasable building square footage and includes our portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures based on ownership percentage.

  "item7": "Item 7:\n                             \n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis reflect our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, please refer to Part II, Item 7. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on \nForm 10-K\n for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGENERAL\nRealty Income (NYSE: O), an S&P 500 company, is real estate partner to the world's leading companies. Founded in 1969, we invest in diversified commercial real estate and, as of December 31, 2024, have a portfolio of over 15,600 properties in all 50 U.S. states, the U.K., and six other countries in Europe. We are known as “The Monthly Dividend Company\n®\n” and have a mission to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. Since our founding, we have declared 656 consecutive monthly dividends and are a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats\n®\n index for having increased our dividend for the last 30 consecutive years. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned or held interests in 15,621 properties, with approximately 339.4 million\n \nsquare feet of leasable space leased to 1,565 clients doing business in 89 separate industries. Of the 15,621\n \nproperties in our portfolio as of December 31, 2024, 15,316, or 98.0%, were single-client properties, and the remaining were multi–client properties. Our total portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the client) of approximately 9.3 years. Total portfolio annualized contractual rent (defined as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables) on our leases as of December 31, 2024 was $4.97 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 32.4% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent came from properties leased to our investment grade clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies. As of December 31, 2024, our top 20 clients (based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent) represented approximately 36.4% of our annualized rent and 10 of these clients had investment grade credit ratings or were subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies. Approximately 91% of our annualized retail contractual rent as of December 31, 2024, was derived from our clients with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business.\nUnless otherwise specified, references to rental revenue in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are exclusive of reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses totaling $303.1 million, $274.2 million, and $184.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIncreases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders\nWe have continued our 56-year history of paying monthly dividends. In addition, we have increased the dividend five times during 2024 and twice during 2025. As of February 2025, we have paid 109 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 129 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.\n2024 Dividend increases\nMonth Declared\nMonth Paid\nMonthly Dividend per share\nIncrease per share\n1st increase\nDec 2023\nJan 2024\n$\n0.2565 \n$\n0.0005 \n2nd increase\nMar 2024\nApr 2024\n$\n0.2570 \n$\n0.0005 \n3rd increase\nMay 2024\nJun 2024\n$\n0.2625 \n$\n0.0055 \n4th increase\nJun 2024\nJul 2024\n$\n0.2630 \n$\n0.0005 \n5th increase\nSep 2024\nOct 2024\n$\n0.2635 \n$\n0.0005 \n2025 Dividend increases\n1st increase\nDec 2024\nJan 2025\n$\n0.2640 \n$\n0.0005 \n2nd increase\nFeb 2025\nMar 2025\n$\n0.2680 \n$\n0.0040 \n24\nTable of \nContents\nThe dividends paid per share during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $3.126, as compared to $3.051 during the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $0.075, or 2.5%.\nThe monthly dividend of $0.2680 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $3.216 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of 6.0% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $53.41 on December 31, 2024. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.\nClosing of Spirit Merger\nOn January 23, 2024, we closed on our previously announced stock-for-stock merger with Spirit. The Merger is further described in note\n 2, Merger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc.\n,\n to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report. \nInvestments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we invested $3.9 billion at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.4%, including an investment in 546 properties, properties under development or expansion, and investments in loans. See notes \n4\n, \nInvestments in Real Estate,\n \n5,\n \nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities, \nand \n6, Investments in Loans and Financing Receivables, \nto the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for further details. \nDispositions \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 294 properties with total net proceeds received of $589.5 million. \nEquity Capital Raising\nDuring 2024, we raised $1.8 billion of proceeds from the sale of common stock, at a weighted average price of $58.33 per share, primarily through proceeds from the sale of common stock through our ATM program. The ATM program issuances during 2024 included 30.2 million shares issued pursuant to forward sale confirmations.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, 1.8 million shares of common stock subject to forward sale confirmations have been executed but not settled. See note \n15\n, \nStockholders' Equity\n, to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for further details. \nNote Issuances\nIn September 2024, we issued £350.0 million of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due October 2029 and £350.0 million of 5.250% senior unsecured notes due September 2041.\nIn August 2024, we issued $500.0 million of 5.375%\n \nsenior unsecured notes due September 2054. \nIn January 2024, we issued $450.0 million of 4.750% senior unsecured notes due February 2029 and $800.0 million of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due February 2034. In connection with the Merger, we also completed the $2.7 billion exchange in principal of outstanding notes issued by Spirit Realty, L.P. (“Spirit OP”). \nSee note \n10,\n \nNotes Payable\n, to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for further details. \nRedemption of Preferred Stock\nOn September 30, 2024, we redeemed all 6.9 million shares outstanding of our 6.000% Series A Preferred Stock (“Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock”), which was converted from Spirit's outstanding preferred stock in connection with the Merger, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. For more details, see note \n16, Series A Preferred Stock, \nto the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report.\n25\nTable of \nContents\nPortfolio Discussion\nLeasing Results\nAt December 31, 2024, we had 205 properties available for lease or sale out of 15,621 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.7% occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio. Our property-level occupancy rates exclude properties with ancillary leases only, such as cell towers and billboards, and properties with possession pending, and include properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. Below is a summary of our portfolio activity for the periods indicated below:\nThree months ended December 31, 2024\nProperties available for lease at September 30, 2024\n196 \nLease expirations \n(1) \n286 \nRe-leases to same client\n(197)\nRe-leases to new client\n(24)\nVacant dispositions\n(56)\nProperties available for lease at December 31, 2024\n205 \nYear ended December 31, 2024\nProperties available for lease at December 31, 2023\n193 \nLease expirations \n(1)\n928 \nRe-leases to same client\n(638)\nRe-leases to new client\n(56)\nVacant dispositions\n(222)\nProperties available for lease at December 31, 2024\n205 \n(1)\nIncludes scheduled and unscheduled expirations (including leases rejected in bankruptcy), as well as future expirations resolved in the periods indicated above.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was $52.5 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of $48.9 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 107.4% on the units re-leased. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was $184.0 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of $174.2 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 105.6% on the units re-leased. \nAs part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions to unrelated, third-party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard, and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients. We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations.\nImpact of \nInflation\nLeases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, retail price index in the case of certain leases in the U.K. (typically subject to ceilings), or increases in clients’ sales volumes. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs. \nMoreover, our strategic focus on the use of net lease agreements reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses. Even though the utilization of net leases reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients' ability to pay rent. Additionally, inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, make it difficult to refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the properties we can acquire if the cost of financing an acquisition is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such property, thereby limiting the properties that can be acquired.\n26\nTable of \nContents\nImpact of Real Estate and Capital Markets\nIn the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the global capital markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and global capital markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.\nImpact of Current Macroeconomic Conditions\nWe continue to monitor developments related to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse impact on our business and our clients. Our clients face additional challenges, including potential changes in consumer confidence levels, behavior and spending and increased operational expenses, such as with respect to labor costs. The extent of the future effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth strategies is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $3.7 billion of liquidity, which consists of cash and cash equivalents of $445.0 million, unsettled ATM forward equity of $91.8 million, and $3.1 billion of availability under our $4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, net of $1.1 billion of borrowing on the revolving credit facility and after deducting $67.3 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs. We use our unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under our commercial paper programs.\nOur primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Material Cash Requirements” table, which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through a combination of the following:\n•\nCash and cash equivalents;\n•\nFuture cash flows from operations;\n•\nIssuances of common stock or debt, or other securities offerings;\n•\nAdditional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or commercial paper programs, which are backstopped by our credit facility; \n•\nShort-term loans;\n•\nAsset dispositions; and\n•\nCredit investment repayments\nIn addition to these sources of liquidity, we are exploring various capital diversification initiatives, including the establishment of a third-party private capital open-end fund. \nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper programs.\nLong-Term Liquidity Requirements \nOur goal is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time. Historically, we have met our principal short-term and long-term capital needs, including the funding of high-quality real estate acquisitions, investments in loans to clients, property development, and capital expenditures by issuing common stock, long-term unsecured notes, and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of an offering to be accretively invested into additional properties or to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.\nCapitalization \nAs of December 31, 2024, our total capitalization was $74.9 billion. Total capitalization consisted of $47.8 billion of common equity (based on the December 31, 2024 closing price on the NYSE of $53.41 and assuming the conversion of 2.7 million common units of Realty Income, L.P.), and total outstanding borrowings of $27.2 billion on our revolving credit facility, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages payable, senior unsecured notes and bonds, and our proportionate share of unconsolidated entities' debt (excluding unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts, and premiums). Our total debt to capitalization was 36.3% at December 31, 2024.\n27\nTable of \nContents\nUniversal Shelf Registration\nOn February 16, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in February 2027. In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.\nATM Program\nUnder our current ATM program, which we entered into in August 2023, we may offer and sell up to 120.0 million shares of common stock (1) by us to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices or by any other methods permitted by applicable law.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 1.8 million shares of unsettled common stock subject to forward sale confirmations through our ATM program, representing approximately $91.8 million in expected net proceeds, which have been executed at a weighted average price of $51.80 per share (assuming full physical settlement of all outstanding shares of common stock, subject to such forward sale agreements and certain assumptions made with respect to settlement dates). During the year ended December 31, 2024, we settled approximately 30.2 million shares of common stock previously sold pursuant to forward sale agreements through our ATM program for approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds. As of December 31, 2024, we had 55.5 million\n \nshares remaining for future issuance under our ATM program. We anticipate maintaining the availability of our ATM program in the future, including the replenishment of authorized shares issuable thereunder. \nDebt Financing Activities \nAt December 31, 2024, our total outstanding borrowings of revolving credit facility, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages payable, and senior unsecured notes and bonds were $26.5 billion, with a weighted average maturity of 5.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 96% of our total debt was fixed rate debt.

Pursuant to the amended and restated term loan agreement, we borrowed $800.0 million in aggregate total borrowings, $300.0 million of which matures in August 2025 and $500.0 million of which matures in August 2027 (the “$800 million term loan agreement”). We also entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement pursuant to which we borrowed $500.0 million in aggregate total borrowings which matures in June 2025 (the “$500 million term loan agreement”).\nTerm Loan Redemption\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repaid our $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan in full upon maturity. \nMortgage Repayments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we made $740.5 million in principal payments, including the full repayment of five mortgages for $735.9 million.\nCovenants\nThe following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. These calculations, which are not based on U.S. GAAP, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance. The actual amounts as of December 31, 2024, are:\nNote Covenants\nRequired\nActual\nLimitation on incurrence of total debt\n<\n 60% of adjusted assets\n41.1 \n%\nLimitation on incurrence of secured debt\n<\n 40% of adjusted assets\n0.3 \n%\nDebt service and fixed charge coverage (trailing 12 months) \n(1)\n>\n 1.5x\n4.7x\nMaintenance of total unencumbered assets\n>\n 150% of unsecured debt\n244.5 \n%\n(1) \nOur debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumptions that: (i) the incurrence of any debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on January 1, 2024 and subject to certain additional adjustments. Such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of January 1, 2024, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period. Fixed charge coverage is calculated in the same manner as the debt service coverage. The following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage at December 31, 2024 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):\nNet income attributable to the Company\n$\n860,772\nPlus: interest expense, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs\n993,848\nPlus: provision for taxes\n66,601\nPlus: depreciation and amortization\n2,395,644\nPlus: provisions for impairment\n425,833\nPlus: pro forma adjustments\n212,913\nLess: gain on sales of real estate\n(117,275)\nIncome available for debt service, as defined\n$\n4,838,336\nTotal pro forma debt service charge\n$\n1,027,604\nDebt service and fixed charge coverage ratio\n4.7x\n29\nTable of \nContents\nCredit Agency Ratings\nThe borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2024, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of A3 with a “stable” outlook and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A- with a “stable” outlook. In addition, we were assigned the following ratings on our commercial paper at December 31, 2024: Moody's Investors Service has assigned a rating of P-2 and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A-2. \nBased on our credit agency ratings as of December 31, 2024, interest rates under our credit facility for U.S. borrowings would have been at the SOFR, plus 0.725% with a SOFR adjustment charge of 0.10% and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.95% over SOFR, for British Pound Sterling (\"GBP\") borrowings, at the SONIA, plus 0.725% with a SONIA adjustment charge of 0.0326% and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.8826% over SONIA, and for Euro (\"EUR\") borrowings at one-month EURIBOR, plus 0.725%, and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.85% over one-month EURIBOR. In addition, our credit facility provides that the interest rates can range between: (i) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 1.40% if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or our senior unsecured debt is unrated and (ii) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 0.70% if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher. In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 0.30% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.10% for a credit rating of A/A2 or higher. \nWe also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions. If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, or common stock.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nCredit Facility and Commercial Paper\n \n(1)\nUnsecured Term\nLoans\nMortgages Payable\nSenior Unsecured Notes and Bonds\nInterest \n(2)\nGround Leases Paid by the Company\n \n(3)\nGround Leases Paid by\nOur Clients\n \n(4)\nOther \n(5)\nTotal\n2025\n$\n67.3 \n$\n800.0 \n$\n43.4 \n$\n1,050.0 \n$\n1,002.5 \n$\n12.5 \n$\n31.8 \n$\n557.1 \n$\n3,564.6 \n2026\n1,062.9 \n1,060.6 \n12.0 \n2,375.0 \n845.2 \n17.6 \n32.4 \n117.9 \n5,523.6 \n2027\n— \n500.0 \n22.3 \n2,313.6 \n736.8 \n11.1 \n30.5 \n98.2 \n3,712.5 \n2028\n— \n— \n1.3 \n2,499.8 \n633.2 \n8.9 \n27.5 \n2.2 \n3,172.9 \n2029\n— \n— \n1.3 \n2,387.5 \n589.0 \n10.0 \n25.0 \n1.9 \n3,014.7 \nThereafter\n— \n— \n1.0 \n12,312.8 \n2,922.1 \n406.7 \n336.4 \n11.0 \n15,990.0 \nTotal\n$\n1,130.2 \n$\n2,360.6 \n$\n81.3 \n$\n22,938.7 \n$\n6,728.8 \n$\n466.8 \n$\n483.6 \n$\n788.3 \n$\n34,978.3 \n(1)\n The initial term of the credit facility expires in June 2026 and includes, at our option, two six-month extensions. At December 31, 2024, there were $1,062.9 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and commercial paper programs outstanding were $67.3 million, which mature between January 2025 and March 2025.\n(2)\n Interest on the commercial paper programs, term loans, mortgages payable, and senior unsecured notes and bonds has been calculated based on outstanding balances at period end through their respective maturity dates. \n(3)\n We currently pay the ground lessors directly for the rent under certain ground lease arrangements.\n(4) \nOur clients, who are generally sub-tenant clients under ground leases, are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases. In the event our client fails to pay the ground lease rent, we are primarily responsible.\n(5)\n “Other” consists of $683.3 million of commitments under construction contracts, $93.5 million for tenant improvements, re-leasing costs, recurring capital expenditures, and non-recurring building improvements, and $11.5 million for contingent purchase consideration obligations related to leasing activities for a multi-tenant property acquired. \nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAs of December 31, 2024, our pro-rata share of secured debt of unconsolidated entities was approximately $659.2 million. \n30\nTable of \nContents\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nDistributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock.\nDistributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders (subject to the adjustment factor applicable to those units at the time of such distribution). \nIn order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2024, our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $2.69 billion, or approximately 126.1% of our estimated taxable income of $2.13 billion. Certain measures are available to us to reduce or eliminate our tax exposure as a REIT, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes, other than our taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a \"TRS\"), has been made. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our cash on hand and funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. We distributed $3.126 per share to stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2024, representing 74.6% of our diluted Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"AFFO\") per share of $4.19. \nFuture distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"FFO\"), Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"Normalized FFO\"), AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.\nDistributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our TRSs) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). However, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.\nDistributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders. Approximately 30.4% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2024, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes.\n31\nTable of \nContents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nTotal Revenue\nThe following summarizes our total revenue (in millions):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nRental (excluding reimbursable)\n$\n4,740.6 \n$\n3,684.0 \n$\n1,056.6 \nRental (reimbursable)\n303.1 \n274.2 \n28.9 \nOther\n227.4 \n120.8 \n106.6 \nTotal revenue\n$\n5,271.1 \n$\n4,079.0 \n$\n1,192.1 \nRental Revenue (excluding reimbursable)\nThe table below summarizes the increase in rental revenue (excluding reimbursable) in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions): \nNumber of Properties\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nProperties acquired during 2024 & 2023\n3,777\n$\n1,278.6 \n$\n273.8 \n$\n1,004.8 \nSame store rental revenue\n (1)\n11,479\n3,319.1 \n3,302.4 \n16.7 \nConstant currency adjustment\n (2)\nN/A\n15.2 \n— \n15.2 \nProperties sold during and prior to 2024\n434\n19.2 \n47.9 \n(28.7)\nStraight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments\nN/A\n(1.7)\n(34.2)\n32.5 \nVacant rents, development and other \n(3)\n365\n90.6 \n91.3 \n(0.7)\nOther excluded revenue \n(4)\nN/A\n19.6 \n2.8 \n16.8 \nTotal\n$\n4,740.6 \n$\n3,684.0 \n$\n1,056.6 \n(1)\nThe same store rental revenue percentage increased by 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023. \n(2)\nFor purposes of comparability, same store rental revenue is presented on a constant currency basis using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2024. None of the properties in France, Germany, Ireland, or Portugal met our same store pool definition for the periods presented. In addition, the same store pool excludes properties assumed on January 23, 2024 as a result of the Merger. \n(3)\nRelates to the aggregate of (i) rental revenue from 315 properties that were available for lease during part of 2024 or 2023 for the year ended December 31, 2024, and (ii) rental revenue for 50 properties under development or completed developments that do not meet our same store pool definition for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(4)\n\"Other excluded revenue\" primarily consists of reimbursements for tenant improvements and rental revenue that is not contractual base rent such as lease termination settlements.\nFor purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year, except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, or (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. Each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above, explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period. \nOf the 16,694 in-place leases in the portfolio, 13,734, or 82.3%, were under leases that provide for increases in rents through: base rent increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), percentage rent based on a percentage of the clients’ gross sales, fixed increases, or a combination of two or more of the aforementioned rent provisions.\nRent based on a percentage of our clients' gross sales, or percentage rent, was $16.0 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Percentage rent represents less than 1% of rental revenue.\nAt December 31, 2024, our portfolio of 15,621 properties was 98.7% leased with 205 properties available for lease or sale, as compared to 98.6% leased with 193 properties available for lease at December 31, 2023. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 4% of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future, given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events.\n32\nTable of \nContents\nRental Revenue (reimbursable)\nA number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. Contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients increased by $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to the growth of our portfolio due to acquisitions; partially offset by lower recoverable taxes as a result of a modification of tax remittance terms with a client in the prior year. \nOther Revenue\nThe following summarizes our total other revenue (in millions):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nInterest income on financing receivables\n$\n124.4 \n$\n102.8 \n$\n21.6 \nInterest income on loans and preferred equity investments\n100.0 \n16.8 \n83.2 \nOther\n3.0 \n1.2 \n1.8 \n$\n227.4 \n$\n120.8 \n106.6 \nTotal Expenses\nThe following summarizes our total expenses (in millions):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n2,395.6\n$\n1,895.2\n$\n500.4\nInterest\n1,017.0\n730.4\n286.6\nProperty (excluding reimbursable)\n74.6\n42.8\n31.8\nProperty (reimbursable)\n303.1\n274.2\n28.9\nGeneral and administrative\n176.9\n144.5\n32.4\nProvisions for impairment\n425.8\n87.1\n338.7\nMerger, transaction, and other costs, net\n96.3\n14.5\n81.8\nTotal expenses\n$\n4,489.3\n$\n3,188.7\n$\n1,300.6\nTotal revenue \n(1)\n$\n4,968.1\n$\n3,804.8\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue \n(1)\n3.6 \n%\n3.8 \n%\nProperty expenses (excluding reimbursable) as a percentage of total revenue \n(1)\n1.5 \n%\n1.1 \n%\n(1)\n Excludes rental revenue (reimbursable). \nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $500.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to the Merger and the acquisitions of properties in 2023 and 2024, which were partially offset by property dispositions. Real estate assets acquired in the Merger contributed an additional $413.4 million of depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \n33\nTable of \nContents\nInterest Expense\nThe following is a summary of the components of our interest expense (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nInterest on our credit facility, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages, senior unsecured notes and bonds, and interest rate swaps\n$\n1,018,445\n$\n788,344\nCredit facility commitment fees\n5,401\n5,357\nAmortization of debt origination and deferred financing costs\n23,939\n26,670\nGain on interest rate swaps\n(7,180)\n(7,189)\nAmortization of net mortgage premiums and discounts\n30\n(12,803)\nAmortization of net note premiums and discounts\n(3,309)\n(60,657)\nCapital lease obligation\n2,025\n1,509\nInterest capitalized\n(22,396)\n(10,808)\nInterest expense\n$\n1,016,955\n$\n730,423\nCredit facility, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages and senior unsecured notes and bonds\nAverage outstanding balances\n$\n25,508,037\n$\n20,537,222\nWeighted average interest rates\n4.07 \n%\n3.83 \n%\nInterest expense increased by $286.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher average borrowings and weighted average interest rates. Included in the overall increase, $67.4 million was from lower non-cash amortization of debt discounts and premiums, primarily due to the amortization of the discount recorded to reflect the fair value of senior notes exchanged in the Merger. These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest driven by increased development activity. See notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for additional information regarding our indebtedness. \nProperty Expenses (excluding reimbursable)\nProperty expenses (excluding reimbursable) consist of costs associated with properties available for lease, non-net-leased properties and general portfolio expenses and include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections and legal fees. \nProperty expenses (excluding reimbursable) increased by $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to a higher number of properties available for lease compared with the same periods in 2023, in addition to acquisitions in 2023 and 2024 in which the lease terms do not obligate the tenant to pay certain expenses, which resulted in higher repairs and maintenance costs, property insurance and taxes. \nProperty Expenses (reimbursable)\nProperty expenses (reimbursable) consist of reimbursable property taxes and operating costs paid on behalf of our clients. Property expenses (reimbursable) increased by $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in portfolio size, resulting in higher common area maintenance, property taxes, and insurance expenses paid on behalf of our clients. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher employee costs of $19.6 million and higher professional fees of $7.9 million as we continue to invest in our people and our platform. \n34\nTable of \nContents\nProvisions for Impairment\nThe following table summarizes our provisions for impairment during the periods indicated below (in millions):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nProvisions for impairment of real estate\n$\n319.0 \n$\n82.2 \nProvision for credit losses\n106.8 \n4.9 \nProvisions for impairment\n$\n425.8 \n$\n87.1 \nProvisions for impairment increased by $338.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period in 2023, as a result of increases of $236.8 million\n \nin impairment of real estate, primarily due to a higher number of properties impaired under the held for sale model, and $101.9 million in higher credit losses recognized on financing receivables for distressed clients accounted for under sales leaseback transactions. \nMerger, Transaction, and Other Costs, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $96.3 million of merger, transaction, and other costs, net consisting of $86.7 million of transaction and integration-related costs related to Spirit, which largely consisted of employee severance, post-combination share-based compensation, transfer taxes, and various professional fees directly attributable to the Merger, as well as $5.1 million related to the lease termination of a legacy corporate facility, and\n \n$4.5 million of organization costs incurred related to our private fund.  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $14.5 million\n \nof merger, transaction, and other costs, net, the majority of which was related to the Merger that closed in January 2024.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nThe following summarizes our property dispositions (dollars in millions):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNumber of properties sold\n294 \n121 \nNet sales proceeds\n$\n589.5 \n$\n117.4 \nGain on sales of real estate\n$\n117.3 \n$\n25.7 \nForeign Currency and Derivative Gain (Loss), Net\nWe borrow in the functional currencies of the countries in which we invest. Net foreign currency gain and loss are primarily related to the remeasurement of intercompany debt from foreign subsidiaries and outstanding borrowings denominated in the local currencies we invest in.\n \nDerivative gain and loss are primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and settlement of designated derivatives reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"AOCI\"). \nForeign currency and derivative gain (loss), net was a $3.4 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared $13.4 million loss with the same period in 2023, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the remeasurement of intercompany debt. \nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entities was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities is due to an increase in our joint venture investments.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net decreased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower gains on insurance proceeds, largely offset by higher interest on short-term investments. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes primarily consist of international income taxes accrued or paid by us and our subsidiaries, as well as state and local taxes. The increase of $14.6 million in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023 is primarily attributable to higher taxable income in the U.K. \n35\nTable of \nContents\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nThe increase in preferred stock dividends of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023 is due to the issuance of Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger. \nExcess of Redemption Value over Carrying Value of Preferred Shares Redeemed\nIn September 2024, we redeemed all 6.9 million of Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. The excess of the $25.00 liquidation price per share over the carrying value of Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock redeemed resulted in a loss on redemption of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note \n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report. In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by U.S. GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates: \nAllocation of the Purchase Price of Real Estate Acquisitions\nManagement must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We evaluate whether or not substantially all of the value of acquired assets is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or a business combination. A majority of our acquisitions qualify as asset acquisitions and the transaction costs associated with those acquisitions are capitalized. However, for transactions that qualify as business combinations, such as the Merger, we expense the transaction costs and categorize them as merger, transaction, and other costs, net in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. For business combinations, we recognize the amount of any purchase consideration that exceeds the fair value of all identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill and may record measurement period adjustments within one year of the acquisition date as permitted under ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations \n(for more details see\n note\n \n2,\n \nMerger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. \nto our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report).\nFor asset acquisitions, we allocate the cost of real estate acquired, inclusive of transaction costs, to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values. For business combinations, all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The difference between the purchase consideration and the aggregated fair value is recognized as goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value and the value of in-place leases, as applicable. Additionally, above-market rents on leases acquired through sale-leaseback transactions under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term, while below-market rents on leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent. In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value of the land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities and is often based upon the various characteristics of the market where the property is located. In addition, any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, client investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.\n36\nTable of \nContents\nProvisions for Impairment - Real Estate Assets\nManagement must make significant judgment as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property, a fair value analysis is performed and, to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the current book value, a provision for impairment is recorded to reduce the book value to estimated fair value. Key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. The carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets. Our strategy of primarily holding properties, long-term, directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable, thus requiring the recognition of an impairment. However, if our strategy, or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized. If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.\n37\nTable of \nContents\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\"Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n\")\nNareit established an EBITDA metric for real estate companies (i.e., EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDA\nre\n) it believed would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among REITs. Our definition of “Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n” is generally consistent with the Nareit definition, other than our adjustment to remove foreign currency and derivative gain and loss and merger, transaction, and other costs, net. We define Adjusted EBITDAre, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent quarter as earnings (net income) before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) provisions for impairment, (v) merger, transaction, and other costs, net, (vi) gain on sales of real estate, (vii) foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, net, and (viii) our proportionate share of adjustments from unconsolidated entities. Our Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDAre reported by other companies or as defined by Nareit, and other companies may interpret or define Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n differently than we do. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n to be a meaningful measure of a REIT’s performance because it provides a view of our operating performance, analyzes our ability to meet interest payment obligations before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, provisions for impairment, gain on sales of real estate and other items, as defined above, that affect comparability, including the removal of non-recurring and non-cash items that industry observers believe are less relevant to evaluating the operating performance of a company. In addition, EBITDA\nre\n is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders, investors, rating agencies, and others as a means of evaluating the operational cash generating capacity of a company prior to servicing debt obligations. Management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n metric, which we refer to as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, is meaningful because it represents our current earnings run rate for the period presented. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n and Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, as defined below, are also used to determine the vesting of performance share awards granted to executive officers. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nshould be considered along with, but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance. We define Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, subject to certain adjustments to incorporate Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we disposed of during the applicable quarter, and include transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period. Our calculation includes all adjustments consistent with the requirements to present Adjusted EBITDA\nre \non a pro forma basis in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes. We believe Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is a useful non-GAAP supplemental measure, as it excludes investments that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from investments acquired during the quarter. Management also uses our ratios of Net Debt/Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nand Net Debt/Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nas measures of leverage in assessing our financial performance, which is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share of debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents), divided by annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nand annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, respectively.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nand\n \nAnnualized Pro Forma EBITDA\nre\n calculations for the periods indicated below (dollars in thousands):\nThree months ended \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\n201,350 \n$\n219,762 \nInterest\n268,149 \n208,313 \nIncome taxes\n20,102 \n15,803 \nDepreciation and amortization\n606,671 \n475,856 \nProvisions for impairment\n142,966 \n27,281 \nMerger, transaction, and other costs, net\n(9,176)\n9,932 \nGain on sales of real estate\n(24,985)\n(5,992)\nForeign currency and derivative (gain) loss, net\n(535)\n18,371 \nProportionate share of adjustments from unconsolidated entities\n18,991 \n14,983 \nQuarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n$\n1,223,533 \n$\n984,309 \nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre \n(1)\n$\n4,894,132 \n$\n3,937,236 \nAnnualized Pro Forma Adjustments \n$\n79,143 \n$\n74,919 \nAnnualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n$\n4,973,275 \n$\n4,012,155 \nTotal debt per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts    \n$\n26,510,798 \n$\n21,480,869 \nProportionate share of unconsolidated entities debt, excluding deferred financing costs\n659,190 \n659,190 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n(444,962)\n(232,923)\nNet Debt \n(2)\n$\n26,725,026 \n$\n21,907,136 \nNet Debt/Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre \n5.5 \nx\n5.6 \nx\nNet Debt/Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n5.4 \nx\n5.5 \nx\n(1)\n We calculate Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n by multiplying the Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n by four.\n(2)\n Net Debt is total debt per our consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share of debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents. \nAs described above, the Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments, which include transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, consist of adjustments to incorporate the Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and remove Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we disposed of during the applicable quarter, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the period, consistent with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The annualized Pro Forma Adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes.

We define Normalized FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, as FFO excluding merger, transaction, and other costs, net. We define diluted FFO and diluted normalized FFO as FFO and normalized FFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests. \nThe following summarizes our FFO and Normalized FFO (in millions, except per share data):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nFFO available to common stockholders\n$\n3,467.7\n$\n2,822.1\n22.9 \n%\nFFO per common share \n(1)\n$\n4.01\n$\n4.07\n(1.5)\n%\nNormalized FFO available to common stockholders\n$\n3,564.0\n$\n2,836.6\n25.6 \n%\nNormalized FFO per common share \n(1)\n$\n4.12\n$\n4.09\n0.7 \n%\n(1)\n All per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis.\n40\nTable of \nContents\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to FFO and Normalized FFO.

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. \n41\nTable of \nContents\nADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (\"AFFO\")\nWe define AFFO, a non-GAAP measure, as FFO adjusted for unique revenue and expense items, which we believe are not as pertinent to the measurement of our ongoing operating performance. We define diluted AFFO as AFFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests. \nThe following summarizes our AFFO (in millions, except per share data):\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nAFFO available to common stockholders\n$\n3,621.4\n$\n2,774.9\n30.5 \n%\nAFFO per common share \n(1)\n$\n4.19\n$\n4.00\n4.8 \n%\n(1)\n All per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis.\nWe consider AFFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement, but they may use the term “CAD” (for Cash Available for Distribution), “FAD” (for Funds Available for Distribution) or other terms. Our AFFO calculations may not be comparable to AFFO, CAD or FAD reported by other companies, and other companies may interpret or define such terms differently than we do.\n42\nTable of \nContents\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Normalized FFO and AFFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (in thousands, except per share amounts). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported AFFO. \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n847,893 \n$\n872,309 \nCumulative adjustments to calculate Normalized FFO \n(1)\n2,716,058 \n1,964,293 \nNormalized FFO available to common stockholders\n3,563,951 \n2,836,602 \nExcess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed\n5,116 \n— \nAmortization of share-based compensation\n32,741 \n26,227 \nAmortization of net debt discounts (premiums) and deferred financing costs\n15,361 \n(44,568)\nAmortization of acquired interest rate swap value \n(2)\n13,935 \n— \nNon-cash change in allowance for credit losses\n (3)\n106,801 \n4,874 \nLeasing costs and commissions\n(8,558)\n(9,878)\nRecurring capital expenditures\n(402)\n(331)\nStraight-line rent and expenses, net\n(171,887)\n(141,130)\nAmortization of above and below-market leases, net\n55,870 \n79,101 \nDeferred tax expense\n3,552 \n— \nProportionate share of adjustments for unconsolidated entities\n(2,078)\n932 \nOther adjustments \n(4)\n7,035 \n23,041 \nAFFO available to common stockholders\n$\n3,621,437 \n$\n2,774,870 \nAFFO allocable to dilutive noncontrolling interests\n6,599 \n5,540 \nDiluted AFFO\n$\n3,628,036 \n$\n2,780,410 \nAFFO per common share:\nBasic\n$\n4.20 \n$\n4.01 \nDiluted\n$\n4.19 \n$\n4.00 \nDistributions paid to common stockholders\n$\n2,691,719 \n$\n2,111,793 \nAFFO available to common stockholders in excess of distributions paid to common stockholders\n$\n929,718 \n$\n663,077 \nWeighted average number of common shares used for computation per share:\nBasic\n862,959 \n692,298 \nDiluted\n865,842 \n694,819 \n(1)\nSee reconciling items for Normalized FFO presented under “Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"FFO\") and Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"Normalized FFO\")\".\n(2)\nIncludes the amortization of the purchase price allocated to interest rate swaps acquired in the Merger.\n(3)\nCredit losses primarily relate to the impairment of financing receivables. \n(4)\nIncludes non-cash foreign currency losses (gains) from remeasurement to USD, mark-to-market adjustments on investments and derivatives that are non-cash in nature, straight-line payments from cross-currency swaps, obligations related to financing lease liabilities, adjustments allocable to noncontrolling interests, and gains and losses on the sale of loans receivable.\nWe believe the non-GAAP financial measure AFFO provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies. In particular, AFFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s on-going operating performance. Therefore, we believe that AFFO is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate U.S. GAAP performance metric to which AFFO should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders. Presentation of the information regarding FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO in the same way, \n43\nTable of \nContents\nso comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments.",
