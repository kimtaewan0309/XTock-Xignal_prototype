  "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS\nMGM Resorts International is referred to as the “Company,” “MGM Resorts,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.”\nOverview\nMGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, is a global gaming and entertainment company with domestic and international locations featuring best-in-class hotels and casinos, state-of-the-art meeting and conference spaces, incredible live and theatrical entertainment experiences, and an extensive array of restaurant, nightlife and retail offerings, as well as sports betting and online gaming operations. \nWe believe we operate several of the finest casino properties in the world and we continually reinvest in our properties to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our properties through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our properties are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. We also believe that through our online gaming operations, we can create a scaled global online gaming business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we operate 16 domestic casino properties and, through our approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “MGM China”), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), operate two casino properties in Macau. Additionally, through our 50% ownership interest in Osaka IR KK, an unconsolidated affiliate, we are developing an integrated resort in Osaka, Japan. We also have global online gaming operations primarily through our consolidated subsidiary LV Lion Holding Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “LeoVegas”) and through our 50% ownership interest in BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM North America Venture”), an unconsolidated affiliate. \nWe lease the real estate assets of our domestic properties pursuant to triple net lease agreements, as further discussed in Note 11. \nIn recent years, in furtherance of our vision to become the world’s premier gaming entertainment company, we have implemented an asset-light business model, which has involved a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to find opportunities to monetize those assets efficiently and allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities, and to return value to our shareholders. At the same time, we have continued to focus on key growth opportunities that align with our vision, particularly by investing in U.S. online sports betting and iGaming through BetMGM North America Venture, acquiring LeoVegas to expand our global online presence, expanding our digital capabilities, and seeking to diversify our Asia operations with development efforts in Japan.\nAs part of that business strategy, we have sought and executed on opportunities to invest in our growth areas, divest our real estate assets, and acquire, or enter into venture transactions, with respect to online gaming and the operations of integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment properties. For additional information relating to our acquisitions, divestitures, venture transactions, and other arrangements made in furtherance of our business strategy, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral \nMost of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our operations to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.\nOur results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as our digital operations and all of our casino properties typically operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City, which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year. However, a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the timing of entertainment and sports events, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, \n1\nincluding New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We also lease space to third-party retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have four reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, MGM China, and MGM Digital, as generally described below. See Note 17 for detailed financial information about our reportable segments.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts.\n Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts:\n \nAria (including Vdara), Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (“The Cosmopolitan”) (upon its acquisition in May 2022), MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including W Las Vegas and Four Seasons), The Mirage (until its disposition in December 2022), Luxor, New York-New York (including The Park), Excalibur, and Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas).\nRegional Operations.\n Regional Operations consists of the following casino properties: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi (until its disposition in February 2023); Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York; and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio.\nOver half of the net revenue from our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is typically derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities and the majority of the net revenue from our Regional Operations is typically derived from gaming operations. Our long-term strategy continues to be to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.\nOur casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games. In addition, we provide our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. \nMGM China\nWe own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming concession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2022 was significantly reduced by the novel 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, visitation during 2023 and 2024 rebounded, and we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.\nOur current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations, which are conducted under a gaming concession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to six different concessionaires. \nMGM Digital\nMGM Digital is our online gaming portfolio which is primarily comprised of LeoVegas, which is headquartered in Sweden and Malta and operates internationally, primarily in Europe, as well as our other consolidated subsidiaries that offer interactive gaming. Revenues are derived from its online gaming product offerings, which include iGaming, digital slots and table games, as well as live dealer and online sports betting.\nCorporate and Other \nWe have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are primarily comprised of our ventures, such as BetMGM North America Venture and Osaka IR KK.\n2\nCustomers and Competition \nWe operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions — We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”\nOur primary methods of successfully competing include:\n•\nLocating our properties in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;\n•\nConstructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;\n•\nRecruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;\n•\nProviding unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; \n•\nInvesting in digital offerings and opportunities domestically and abroad; and\n•\nDeveloping distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations\nOur customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our properties during midweek and off-peak periods.\nOur Las Vegas casino properties compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.\nOutside Nevada, our properties primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. \nMGM China\nThe Macau gaming market has two primary customer bases: main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. The majority of MGM China’s casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect this customer base will be the primary source of growth in the future. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high end customers. \nOur key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires. We also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas. \nMGM Digital\nOur digital customers are located within the geolocation of the jurisdictions in which we are licensed to operate. By operating in licensed markets, which are subject to costs in the form of gaming taxes, we benefit from higher barriers to entry, which changes the competitive picture and provides value to companies such as ours. Our primary competitors are \n3\nother international online gaming companies. We also face competition from integrated resorts as well as other providers of entertainment. \nMarketing\nOur marketing strategy is deeply rooted in personalized engagement powered by advanced analytics to create experiences that resonate with our current and desired guests. Personalized marketing serves as a critical driver of growth for the company, enabling us to deepen customer loyalty, increase engagement, and enhance lifetime value by aligning our offerings with each guest segment’s unique preferences and needs. Central to this approach is MGM Rewards, our tiered loyalty program, which enables customers to earn benefits across gaming and non-gaming experiences. This program serves as a vital tool for capturing guest preferences and behaviors, allowing us to personalize interactions, offers, and experiences that are meaningful to each guest. As members progress through program tiers, they unlock exclusive benefits such as customized offers, priority access, and invitations to special events along with hotel stays, dining credits, and unique MGM Resorts experiences. At MGM China, we offer the M life loyalty program, which provides loyalty opportunities similar to MGM Rewards for non-gaming customers, and the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers. By incentivizing customers within our physical properties and with BetMGM North America Venture, we foster loyalty and increase customer lifetime value.\nIn addition to our loyalty programs, we leverage multiple marketing channels—including brand ambassadors, online, radio, television, print, and billboards in select U.S. and international cities. Our regional marketing offices and direct outreach channels via mail, email, and social media ensure consistent engagement. Our advanced data and analytics capabilities underpin our direct marketing, enabling us to segment customers based on preferences, behaviors, and their overall value to the organization. This segmentation allows us to deliver the highest level of personalized experiences across guest tiers, ensuring our product and program investments align with customer desires, drive incremental visits, and strengthen long-term relationships.\nWe leverage paid media and various social channels to reach our desired guests with precision, using targeted segmentation to deliver personalized content that resonates with specific customer interests and preferences. This allows us to engage high-value segments more effectively, amplifying brand loyalty and optimizing our marketing investments by connecting the right guests with the right offers and experiences.\nStrategy \nOur vision is to become \nthe world’s premier gaming entertainment company\n. We are focused on driving profitability in our integrated resorts in the U.S. and Macau, expanding our international brick-and-mortar footprint in the world’s premier gaming markets, growing our global digital brands, and efficient capital allocation. Our globally recognized brands, strategically located assets, development opportunities, and evolving digital platforms allow us to reach an unparalleled target addressable market.\nTo achieve our vision, we developed our strategic plan, which is built on five pillars:\n \n•\nStrong People and Culture. \nRecruit, develop and retain the best talent. Cultivate a culture of respect and a workplace that reflects our communities, employees, partners, and stakeholders.\n•\nCustomer-Centric Model\n.\n Prioritize our customers by leveraging our collection of strong brands and insights from our leading customer loyalty program, MGM Rewards, to deliver exceptional entertainment experiences and revenue growth.\n•\nGaming Entertainment.\n Innovate our gaming entertainment offerings to elevate quality and competitive edge. Expand our reach across both physical and online platforms to serve the widest possible market.\n•\nOperational Excellence\n.\n Continuously refine our operating model to diversify business mix, improve operating efficiencies and increase margins. Strengthen digital capabilities to enhance customer loyalty. \n•\nDisciplined Capital Allocation to Maximize Shareholder Value. \nPursue targeted, attractive ROI opportunities that align with our strategic vision. Prioritize shareholder returns and maintain a strong balance sheet. \nThe strategic plan is designed for ongoing review, measurement, and adjustment to seize emerging opportunities.\nIn allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on maintaining and enhancing existing properties, pursuing strategic growth through mergers, acquisitions and development, repaying debt and maximizing shareholder returns. We believe there are sound investment opportunities in new initiatives and at existing properties that will deliver profitable returns.\nWe regularly evaluate targeted opportunities in both domestic and international markets that provide attractive returns on investment. These include: Owning, managing, and operating gaming and non-gaming facilities, as well as \n4\nexpanding into new markets for iGaming and online sports betting. Additionally, we leverage our management expertise and the strong recognition of our brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. \nWe continue to enhance the efficiency of our operating model by optimizing our Centers of Excellence and achieving best-in-class operating performance through adjustments within corporate and business units. In addition, we have and will continue to refine several improvement and cost cutting initiatives focused on labor, sourcing, and revenue generation. These efforts strengthen our operating model and position us as a more resilient company.\nWe continue to focus on our key growth opportunities, including developing an integrated resort in Japan, investing in BetMGM North America Venture, advancing international digital opportunities, and exploring a full-scale commercial gaming opportunity in New York. \nIn Japan, Osaka IR KK \nsigned an agreement with Osaka Prefecture and Osaka City in September 2023 to implement its government-certified Area Development Plan (“ADP”) for the development of an integrated resort in Osaka, Japan. Preliminary construction\n began on the site of the future resort in 2024.\nWe believe that BetMGM North America Venture is well-positioned as a long-term leader in online sports betting and iGaming. BetMGM North America Venture has launched Single App Single Wallet in Nevada allowing our customers who sign up while visiting one of our properties the ability to bring their digital wallet home, an important customer retention feature. BetMGM North America Venture has also increased its parlay product capabilities with the addition of Angstrom technology which we expect to help drive further customer satisfaction as well as increased hold for BetMGM North America Venture. \nWe are growing our business internationally through MGM Digital by building on our core markets and identifying new opportunities for expansion and brand distribution, requiring limited capital. We continue to evolve our technology platform, the backbone for our development.\nIn connection with our vision to transform Empire City in New York into a full-scale commercial gaming facility, we are actively working on our response to the request for application that was issued in January 2023 for three downstate commercial gaming licenses. \nIn the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), we currently have a non-gaming management agreement with Wasl Hospitality to bring the Bellagio, Aria, and MGM Grand brands to Dubai. With the UAE’s establishment of the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority, tasked with creating a regulatory framework for commercial gaming in the UAE, we are encouraged by the potential opportunity for gaming expansion in Dubai. We are continuously exploring new geographies for future development, including Thailand.\nTechnology\nWe believe technology, powered by our advanced data and analytics capabilities, enables us to deliver highly personalized digital experiences and targeted marketing that elevate the guest experience. This approach drives operational efficiency and supports sustainable, long-term revenue growth. Through our app and other digital platforms, we deliver tailored content and experiences that deepen guest engagement and build loyalty to our brand and offerings. Additionally, with a focus on the development of our proprietary technology and product innovation, we believe this positions our digital operations for further expansion into new markets and to maintain our growth within existing markets.\nWe continue to expand our digital portfolio by enhancing e-commerce and seamlessly integrating our physical resorts with digital casino and sports betting experiences. This includes cross-property and omni-channel promotions in Las Vegas that provide added value to our guests. Additionally, we have deployed digital commerce and pricing technologies that allow us to offer personalized packages and targeted upsell opportunities.\nOur MGM Rewards loyalty technology platform enables guests to earn points seamlessly across gaming and non-gaming activities, with improved redemption flows and a more streamlined experience through the app. Enhanced mobile and self-service check-in options have further driven app adoption, creating a smoother arrival experience for our guests. Our digital concierge has also improved service with faster response times during guest stays.\nAdditionally, our data capabilities empower data-driven decision-making, delivering faster insights and enabling more agile and informed decisions across all areas of our business. \n5\nSocial Impact & Sustainability \nAt MGM Resorts, our commitment to environmental and social responsibility has been long-standing. For over a decade, we have had a dedicated board committee focused on Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability (“CSR&S”). In 2019, we appointed one Executive Committee-level leader to manage the MGM Resorts Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence. Reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, this leader serves as liaison to the CSR&S Committee of the Board of Directors. This leader also oversees the Human Resources function and is thus able to integrate social impact and sustainability considerations more deeply into the core culture of our organization through proactive management of our human and social capital initiatives. \nSocial Impact and Sustainability Reporting\nThe Company’s Social Impact and Sustainability Task Force, which is composed of executives from across the Company, including representation from the Company’s Executive Committee, conducted our first assessment of priority Social Impact and Sustainability topics, which guided our social impact and sustainability reporting since 2020. In 2023, we engaged external experts to assist with a more comprehensive assessment that focuses on both a topic’s impact on our Company, as well as our Company’s related impact on the world at large. We published a summary of our findings from this assessment in early 2024.\nThroughout 2024, we continued our progress on key social impact and sustainability initiatives and disclosures, supporting our commitment to MGM Resorts’ Focused on What Matters platform and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our most recent Social Impact & Sustainability Report illustrated the Company’s progress towards our public goals. In 2024, we continued our reporting aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and published our second Consolidated Social Impact & Sustainability Factbook. The factbook, which reflects U.S. and Macau operations data, is a centralized collection of our key social impact and sustainability metrics including our corporate social impact and sustainability goals, metrics aligned with Global Reporting Initiative standards, and metrics aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Hotels & Lodging and Casinos & Gaming sector standards. We expect to publish updated materials in 2025 detailing progress made in 2024. \nThese reports, as well as other disclosures, assurance statements, and policies are available at mgmresorts.com/en/company/esg.html. The content on this website is for informational purposes only and such content is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nWe believe environmental stewardship is an important component of corporate leadership; as a Company, we strive to develop and operate our casino properties responsibly. Our environmental sustainability team assesses and implements projects and processes aimed to improve our environmental footprint with a focus on climate and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, energy and water efficiency, material disposal and diversion, and stakeholder engagement.\nClimate Leadership\nWe have undertaken a comprehensive set of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of material climate-related risks on business activities. We believe our investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy help mitigate the potential financial impact of climate transition risks on our Company. We also endeavor to mitigate the physical impacts of climate change on our Company, such as the coastal flooding management actions we have taken at a small number of our properties in areas that may be subject to sea-level rise and extreme weather events.\nIn 2023, the Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”), a leading organization for third party guidance and independent validation of climate targets, approved our climate targets as science-based and in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our combined Scope 1 & 2 target was validated as being in line with the 1.5 °C pathway, currently the organization’s most ambitious designation. We continue to make progress on our renewable energy strategy with our recently announced power purchase agreement to provide our Las Vegas properties with 115 megawatt (MW) of solar capacity and 100 MW of battery storage, in addition to the 100 MW MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array, which completed its third full year of operation. \nThese renewable energy sources play a key role in meeting the following climate goals across our domestic and MGM China operations:\n•\n50% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions intensity (pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot; 2007 baseline) by 2030;\n•\n50% reduction in absolute Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; 2019 baseline) by 2030 (SBTi validated);\n6\n•\n30% reduction in absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; 2019 baseline) from purchased goods and services, fuel-and energy-related activities, waste generated in operations, and employee commuting by 2030 (SBTi validated); and\n•\n100% renewable electricity purchased in U.S. and 80% purchased globally by 2030.\nWe intend to continue to explore additional renewable energy opportunities to meet our renewable power and emissions goals. \nWater Stewardship\nWe believe in the importance of responsible water usage throughout our operations and supply chain. Our goal is to enhance long-term water efficiency by optimizing water systems and implementing conservation measures. \nIn response to declining conditions in the Colorado River Basin, in 2022, we developed a water white paper that established our ambition for water stewardship including a strategic framework and a global water policy to codify our commitment. Additionally, as a result of this white paper, MGM Resorts became the first gaming and Las Vegas-based company to endorse the CEO Water Mandate, a global coalition of major companies working to address global water challenges. \nThroughout 2024, we refined our approach to water stewardship through the identification of five principles: Measurement, Efficiency, Quality, Culture and Citizenship. We strive to be a global leader in water stewardship and envision a sustainable future in which we have a positive impact in Las Vegas and the other communities in which we operate. In order to achieve this goal, we are focused on addressing water issues at the local level across our operations and supply chain, such as in Southern Nevada where consumptive water use reduction is a critical priority. We have engaged with stakeholders in each of our U.S. regions to develop action plans and enhance our basin-level water stewardship. In addition, we continued our water-related disclosures by participating in the 2024 CDP Water Security questionnaire. Furthermore, on World Water Day in 2024 (March 22), we announced a grant to the Southern Nevada water authority, enabling local employees to receive additional incentives for at-home water conservation to help advance our commitment to water conservation and support the environment. \nResponsible Gaming\nWe have woven responsible gaming and gambling education into the fabric of our world-class gaming experiences and premier guest service. We train our employees to reinforce our commitment and approach to responsible gaming. We also offer a variety of resources throughout our properties, with the MGM Rewards Desk acting as the central hub for our innovative responsible gaming program, GameSense. GameSense is an industry-leading, enterprise-wide program that aligns responsible gambling policies with enhanced guest service and education. It is designed to promote sustainable and enjoyable experiences, by helping guests and employees make informed gambling decisions. At MGM China, we established a Responsible Gaming Committee and a Responsible Gaming Operations Team that act as lines of defense in identifying and addressing problem gaming-related issues. Digitally, we have implemented a number of functions and tools to protect customers and work proactively to provide support for individuals who develop unsound gaming behavior. Our website, LeoSafePlay.com, is dedicated to promoting responsible gaming. We have also invested heavily in technology and in the development of algorithms that detect early signs among players that can indicate a risk for unsound gaming. Within the framework of LeoSafePlay, we have launched a tool based on machine learning and algorithms that help in the creation of risk profiles for customers who are at risk of developing a gaming problem.\nHuman Capital \nWe are focused on fostering a people-driven culture exemplified by how we lead and uphold the following core company values: Captivate Our Audience, Inspire Excellence, Champion Inclusion, and Win Together, to create an engaged workforce. Our long-term people strategy is designed to enhance talent attraction and development to support business objectives, guest experience, community engagement, and financial goals. Our workforce development strategies support local hiring and developing a robust workforce in the local communities in which we operate through veteran support, community training and employment, fulfilling local hiring commitments (where applicable), and through internship, educational, and leadership development programs. In response to labor demands and agile staffing requirements, we have significantly streamlined our recruitment processes for faster sourcing and recruitment to meet business and operational needs. We work across the enterprise to strengthen our corporate culture, drive employee engagement, and foster well-being.\nGrowth and Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed, now and for the future, to be a premier employer of choice across the gaming, hospitality, and entertainment industries. We are committed to a culture of continuous learning \n7\nwhere employees, at all levels, are engaged in developing their knowledge, skills, and abilities through a variety of modalities, including digitally, and we support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and professional/personal development and skills-based learning. We continue to introduce new learning and development initiatives focused on a broad range of employee population segments. We offer tuition reimbursement, contribute toward student loan debt repayment, and have partnered with the Nevada System of Higher Education to enable employees to earn a degree online free of charge for all credit hours. Over the past year we have focused on growing our talent pipeline, reinforcing our leadership expectations and company culture across all leadership positions and enhancing employee recognition and onboarding programs applicable across all levels. \nFocused on Our Communities\nOur corporate and people strategies and a social impact and sustainability approach that centers on embracing humanity. A comprehensive framework lays out five strategic pillars to guide our work: innovation; invest in people; build an inclusive culture; grow business and customer engagement; and enhance marketplace leadership and community relations, including through our supplier relationships. As part of this strategy, we have committed to the following four long-range 2025 goals: (1) ensure that our employees have equal access to leadership opportunities, (2) advance positive impacts within purchases of goods and services by building capacity among local suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Mentorship Program to achieve 150 graduates, and (4) train 100% of U.S. management employees on social impact and sustainability policies and goals. Internally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance the core value to Champion Inclusion by cultivating a culture of respect. The channels include but are not limited to open forums and conversations with executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee and business network groups, which are open to all employees. Responsibility is driven and led by our Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President.\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\nOur approach to employee health and wellness is holistic and multi-dimensional, focusing on the four pillars of the MGM Resorts World of Wellbeing (WOW): physical, emotional, financial and community. It is our priority to provide competitive benefit offerings that support the needs of our workforce. In an effort to better support the emotional well-being of our employees, we recently implemented a new Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provider who offers an enhanced mental health benefit to our employees and their loved ones.\nCommunity Engagement and Philanthropy\nOur approach, grounded by \nFocused on What Matters: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet\n, articulates our purpose and our commitment to a set of priorities and goals intended to inspire actions that will have an enduring impact on the world. We understand our responsibility to contribute to the social and economic progress of the communities in which we operate and are invested in growing and supporting such communities. Our strategies aim to reflect, sustain, and build on the best aspects of a community by creating good jobs, providing strong wages, teaching resilient skills, and implementing workforce development opportunities. \nWe encourage active engagement in volunteerism and philanthropic opportunities, from serving local community needs to supporting global commitments. We instill philanthropic commitment and pride through our employee foundation. The MGM Resorts Foundation was established in 2002 to facilitate engagement opportunities that allow employees to contribute to charitable causes of their choice by providing two types of grants: (1) the Employee Emergency Grant, which benefits our employees, and (2) the Community Grant, which benefits local communities. In an effort to foster employee engagement in our philanthropic efforts, we established a Matching Gifts program in 2021, matching employee donations to their charities of choice.\nEmployees and Labor Relations\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 45,000 full-time and 18,000 part-time employees domestically. In addition, we had approximately 13,000 and 2,000 employees at MGM China and LeoVegas, respectively. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 38,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2024. The collective bargaining agreement between The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas covering approximately 3,000 employees is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2025. Additionally, we expect certain collective bargaining agreements to expire in 2025, including our collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters covering valet operations at nine of our Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Negotiations for successor contracts will be scheduled with our employees’ collective bargaining representatives as contract expiration dates approach and will continue throughout 2025. As of December 31, 2024, none of the employees of MGM China or LeoVegas are part of a labor union and MGM China and LeoVegas are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.\n8\nIntellectual Property\nWe use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have the rights necessary to conduct our continuing operations. The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property as an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, or copyright, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. \nWe believe that our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Park MGM, Beau Rivage, Empire City, LeoVegas, and BetMGM, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions around the world, as applicable. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks, such as The Mirage, in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed for our brands attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights. \nGovernment Regulation and Licensing \nThe gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos and our online operations are subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located or operates. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. \nA more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. \nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. \nIn addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations.\nFor a discussion of potential risks to our business relating to regulatory matters, including due to the potential impact of legislative and regulatory changes, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy.”\n9\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements \nThis Form 10-K and our 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. \nYou should also be aware that while we from time to time communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them any material non-public information, internal forecasts or other confidential business information.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThis management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K \nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 23, 2024\n, with the exception of our MGM Digital segment, for which discussion as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 has been included below\n.\nOverview \nOur primary business is the operation of casino properties, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities, as well as the operation of digital gaming through our online platforms. We lease the real estate assets of our domestic properties pursuant to triple net lease agreements. \nOur results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. Our results will also depend upon our ability to expand our ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting. \nOur results are also affected by significant recent developments in our business, which principally consist of transactions we have executed in furtherance of our businesses strategy and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the removal of COVID-19 travel restrictions in Macau and mainland China.\nOverview of strategic business developments\n•\nIn July 2018, we and Entain formed BetMGM North America Venture. In connection with its formation, we provided BetMGM North America Venture with exclusive access to all of our domestic land based and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online gaming operations, and Entain provided BetMGM North America Venture with exclusive access to its technology in the United States.\n•\nOn September 28, 2021, we announced that we and ORIX were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner. In December 2021, we and ORIX formed a venture, Osaka IR KK, through which we plan to develop the integrated resort. On April 27, 2022, we, together with Osaka prefecture/city, Osaka IR KK, and ORIX, submitted an ADP to Japan’s central government. On April 14, 2023, we announced that the Japanese government officially certified the ADP, and, in September 2023, Osaka IR KK signed an agreement with Osaka to implement the ADP. Preliminary construction began on the site of the future resort in 2024.\n•\nOn April 29, 2022, VICI acquired MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”) in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). MGP Class A shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we received 1.366 units of VICI Properties OP LLC (“VICI OP”) in exchange for each MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (“MGP OP”) unit held by us. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP redeemed the majority of our VICI OP units, with us retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in VICI OP. MGP’s Class B share that was held by us was cancelled. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transaction. In connection with the VICI Transaction, we entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. See Note 4 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.\n•\nOn May 17, 2022, we acquired the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, plus working capital adjustments, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. Additionally, we entered into \n36\na lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. See Note 4 and Note 11 for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.\n•\nIn June 2022, the Macau government enacted a new gaming law that provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions that were awarded in the public tender that concluded in December 2022, such as limiting the term of concessions to a maximum of 10 years. As a result, we reassessed the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset and reduced the useful life to align with the contractual term of the subconcession, which expired on December 31, 2022, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations. See Note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In December 2022, we were awarded a new gaming concession, which permits the operation of games of chance or other games in casinos in Macau, commencing on January 1, 2023. \n•\nOn September 7, 2022, we acquired LeoVegas through a tender offer at a cash price of SEK 61 per share, for a total fair value of equity interests acquired of approximately $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards. See Note 4 for discussion of this transaction.\n•\nOn December 19, 2022, we completed the sale of the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc. for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, or $1.1 billion, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove The Mirage and reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion of this transaction.\n•\nOn February 15, 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE Gaming Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Cherokee Nation Business, for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion of this transaction.\n•\nIn August 2023, LeoVegas completed the acquisition of the majority ownership of Push Gaming, a digital gaming developer.\nCybersecurity Issue\nIn September 2023, we identified a cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to certain of our U.S. systems by criminal actors. The Cybersecurity Issue, together with the incident response efforts, resulted in some disruptions to our business operations and we also incurred expenses for technology consulting services, legal fees and other third-party advisors in connection with this issue, which were not material to our 2023 results. We have cybersecurity insurance from which we began to receive proceeds in 2024.\nVisitation Statistics\nThe Las Vegas Strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 2% compared to 2023 according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, primarily from sporting events hosted by Las Vegas in February 2024 as well as the general expansion of sporting, music, and entertainment events throughout 2024.\nThe MGM China segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and, on February 6, 2023, all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Macau visitor arrivals increased 24% compared to 2023 according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, as 2024 was positively affected by the continued recovery after the removal of COVID-19 related travel and entry restrictions. \nKey Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are: \n•\nGaming revenue indicators: table games drop, which is the total amount of cash and net markers issued and deposited into the drop box, and slot handle, which is the gross amount wagered in slot machines, (volume \n37\nindicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. “Win” or “hold” percentages represent the net amount of gaming wins and losses in relation to table games drop or slot handle; and\n•\nHotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) – hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“RevPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.\nResults of Operations\n \nSummary Operating Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results: \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands)\nNet revenues\n$\n17,240,545 \n$\n16,164,249 \n$\n13,127,485 \nOperating income\n1,490,456 \n1,891,497 \n1,439,372 \nNet income\n1,064,608 \n1,314,924 \n206,731 \nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International\n746,558 \n1,142,180 \n1,473,093 \nConsolidated net revenues increased 7% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to MGM China increasing 28%, MGM Digital increasing 28%, and our Regional Operations increasing 1%, each as compared to 2023 and as discussed below. \nConsolidated operating income decreased 21% in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was due primarily to the $399 million gain in the prior year period related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica recorded in property transactions, net, an increase in payroll related expenses, gaming taxes, and promotional expense, partially offset by the increase in net revenues discussed above.\n38\nNet Revenues by Segment\nThe following table presents a detail by segment of net revenues:\n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands) \nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\n \n \n \nCasino\n$\n1,960,146 \n$\n2,127,612 \n$\n2,104,096 \nRooms\n3,159,497 \n3,027,668 \n2,729,715 \nFood and beverage\n2,356,718 \n2,289,812 \n2,125,738 \nEntertainment, retail and other\n1,339,752 \n1,354,054 \n1,438,823 \n \n8,816,113 \n8,799,146 \n8,398,372 \nRegional Operations\n \n \n \nCasino\n2,737,778 \n2,712,205 \n2,901,072 \nRooms\n304,322 \n296,100 \n284,213 \nFood and beverage\n456,129 \n440,002 \n429,188 \nEntertainment, retail and other\n222,093 \n222,002 \n201,412 \n \n3,720,322 \n3,670,309 \n3,815,885 \nMGM China\n \n \n \nCasino\n3,496,697 \n2,787,837 \n567,573 \nRooms\n217,798 \n177,158 \n43,216 \nFood and beverage\n265,883 \n161,669 \n49,312 \nEntertainment, retail and other\n42,006 \n26,945 \n13,492 \n \n4,022,384 \n3,153,609 \n673,593 \nMGM Digital\nCasino\n552,012 \n432,146 \n133,435 \nReportable segment net revenues\n17,110,831 \n16,055,210 \n13,021,285 \nCorporate and other\n129,714 \n109,039 \n106,200 \n \n$\n17,240,545 \n$\n16,164,249 \n$\n13,127,485 \nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts net revenues for 2024 were flat compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in rooms revenue and food and beverage revenue in the current year period, offset by a decrease in casino revenue, each discussed below. \nLas Vegas Strip Resorts casino revenue decreased 8% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a decrease in table games drop and win percentage.\n39\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nTable games drop\n$\n6,028 \n$\n6,215 \n$\n5,804 \nTable games win\n$\n1,472 \n$\n1,636 \n$\n1,391 \nTable games win %\n24.4 \n%\n26.3 \n%\n24.0 \n%\nSlot handle\n$\n23,840 \n$\n23,920 \n$\n22,812 \nSlot win\n$\n2,240 \n$\n2,224 \n$\n2,127 \nSlot win %\n9.4 \n%\n9.3 \n%\n9.3 \n%\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts rooms revenue increased 4% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in RevPAR. \nThe following table shows key hotel statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nOccupancy\n94 \n%\n93 \n%\n89 \n%\nAverage daily rate (ADR)\n$\n260 \n$\n256 \n$\n229 \nRevenue per available room (RevPAR)\n$\n245 \n$\n237 \n$\n203 \nLas Vegas Strip Resorts food and beverage revenue increased 3% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in catering and banquet revenue. \nRegional Operations\nRegional Operations net revenues increased 1% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to the increase in casino revenues, partially offset by the disposition of Gold Strike Tunica in February 2023.\nRegional Operations casino revenue increased 1% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in slot win percentage and the strike at MGM Grand Detroit in the prior year, partially offset by the disposition of Gold Strike Tunica in February 2023.\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for our Regional Operations:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nTable games drop\n$\n3,909 \n$\n3,886 \n$\n4,469 \nTable games win \n$\n807 \n$\n814 \n$\n933 \nTable games win %\n20.6 \n%\n21.0 \n%\n20.9 \n%\nSlot handle\n$\n26,894 \n$\n26,850 \n$\n28,226 \nSlot win\n$\n2,659 \n$\n2,586 \n$\n2,692 \nSlot win %\n9.9 \n%\n9.6 \n%\n9.5 \n%\nMGM China\nMGM China net revenues increased 28% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in casino revenues discussed below.\n40\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for MGM China:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nMain floor table games drop\n$\n14,681 \n$\n12,115 \n$\n2,512 \nMain floor table games win\n$\n3,666 \n$\n2,736 \n$\n572 \nMain floor table games win %\n25.0 \n%\n22.6 \n%\n22.8 \n%\nMGM China casino revenues increased 25% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to the current year being positively affected by a full year of recovery of operations after the removal of COVID-19 related travel and entry restrictions in the first quarter of 2023 as well as an increase in main floor table games win percentage.\nMGM Digital\nMGM Digital net revenues increased 28% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to entry into new markets in the current year.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin decreased to 35.2% in 2024 compared to 36.3% in 2023 due primarily to an increase in payroll-related expenses.\nRegional Operations\nRegional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR increased 1% compared to 2023. Regional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin decreased to 30.7% in 2024 compared to 30.9% in 2023 due primarily to an increase in payroll \n41\nrelated expenses, partially offset by the increase in casino revenues.\nMGM China\nMGM China’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR increased 25% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to the increase in casino revenues. MGM China’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin decreased to 27.0% in 2024 compared to 27.5% in 2023 due primarily to the increase in promotional expense and in lower margin non-gaming revenues, partially offset by the increase in casino revenues in 2024, discussed above.\nMGM Digital\nMGM Digital’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR loss was $77 million in 2024 compared to $32 million 2023. The change was due primarily to the increase in marketing costs due to entry into new markets, partially offset by the increase in revenues in 2024.\nMGM Digital’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR loss was $32 million in 2023 compared to Segment Adjusted EBITDAR of $0.4 million in 2022. The change is due primarily to a full year of operations of LeoVegas reflected for 2023 while 2022 included results of operations of LeoVegas from the date of acquisition of September 7, 2022 through December 31, 2022.\nOperating Results – Details of Certain Charges\nProperty transactions, net consisted of the following: \n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands) \nGain on sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica\n$\n— \n$\n(398,787)\n$\n— \nGain on sale of the operations of The Mirage\n— \n— \n(1,066,784)\nOther property transactions, net\n81,316 \n28,274 \n29,787 \n \n$\n81,316 \n$\n(370,513)\n$\n(1,036,997)\nSee Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of property transactions, net.\nIncome (loss) from Unconsolidated Affiliates \nThe following table summarizes information related to our share of operating loss from unconsolidated affiliates: \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands)\nMGP BREIT Venture (through April 29, 2022)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n51,051 \nBetMGM North America Venture\n(110,079)\n(90,894)\n(234,464)\nOther\n19,426 \n28,790 \n23,200 \n \n$\n(90,653)\n$\n(62,104)\n$\n(160,213)\nIn connection with the VICI Transaction in April 2022, we deconsolidated MGP, and accordingly derecognized the assets and liabilities of MGP, which included MGP OP’s investment in the venture that was 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of MGP OP at the time of the transaction (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”). \n42\nNon-operating Results \nInterest expense\nThe following table summarizes information related to interest expense, net: \n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands) \nTotal interest incurred\n$\n445,660 \n$\n463,175 \n$\n595,692 \nInterest capitalized\n(2,430)\n(2,882)\n(738)\n \n$\n443,230 \n$\n460,293 \n$\n594,954 \nGross interest expense was $446 million in 2024 compared to $463 million in 2023. The decrease from 2023 is due primarily to a decrease in weighted average outstanding debt. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt.\nOther, net \nOther income, net was $71 million in 2024 compared to $43 million in 2023. Other, net in 2024 was primarily comprised of foreign currency transaction gain of $129 million primarily related to USD denominated debt held by a foreign subsidiary, interest and dividend income of $81 million, and loss related to foreign currency contracts of $116 million. Other, net in 2023 was primarily comprised of interest and dividend income of $164 million and foreign currency transaction loss of $106 million primarily related to USD denominated debt held by a foreign subsidiary.\nIncome taxes \nThe following table summarizes information related to our income taxes:\n \n \n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands) \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n1,117,065 \n$\n1,472,763 \n$\n903,799 \nProvision for income taxes\n(52,457)\n(157,839)\n(697,068)\nEffective income tax rate\n4.7 \n%\n10.7 \n%\n77.1 \n%\nFederal, state and foreign income taxes paid, net of refunds\n$\n266,996 \n$\n344,397 \n$\n22,955 \nOur effective rate for 2024 was favorably impacted primarily by an increase in Macau gaming profits which are exempt from complementary tax and a decrease in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets. Our effective rate for 2023 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in the valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards resulting from a projected increase in foreign source income and favorably impacted by an increase in Macau income offset by expiring net operating losses from prior years subject to valuation allowances. These changes were partially offset by an increase in incremental U.S. tax on foreign earnings.\nCash paid for income taxes decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the payment of income taxes in 2023 related to the disposition of The Mirage and Gold Strike Tunica, partially offset by the utilization of our remaining overall domestic loss in 2023 prior to fully sheltering 50% of domestic taxable income.\nCertain jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation commencing in 2024 as well as future years influenced by the OECD Pillar Two framework, including a minimum tax rate of 15%. The enacted tax laws with respect to Pillar Two have not materially impacted our current year financial results and are not expected to materially impact future financial results. We are unable to predict when and how Pillar Two will be enacted into law or modified to align with OECD guidance in the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is possible that Pillar Two legislative changes could have a material impact on future financial results. We will continue to monitor worldwide regulatory developments as additional guidance is released.\n43\nReportable Segment GAAP measure \n“Segment Adjusted EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, triple net lease rent expense, loss from unconsolidated affiliates, and also excludes gain on REIT transactions, net as well as corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation. Triple net lease rent expense is the expense for rent to landlords under triple net operating leases for its domestic properties, the ground subleases of Beau Rivage and National Harbor, and the land concessions at MGM China. “Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin” is Segment Adjusted EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.\nNon-GAAP Measures\n“Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, and gain on REIT transactions, net. \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA information is a non-GAAP measure that is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because it is among the measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance, and because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our properties, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. However, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be construed as an alternative or substitute to any measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For example, we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, while we believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to or substitute for operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative or substitute for cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may calculate Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is included herein.\n44\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MGM Resorts International to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands)\nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International\n$\n746,558 \n$\n1,142,180 \n$\n1,473,093 \nPlus: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n318,050 \n172,744 \n(1,266,362)\nNet income\n1,064,608 \n1,314,924 \n206,731 \nProvision for income taxes\n52,457 \n157,839 \n697,068 \nIncome before income taxes\n1,117,065 \n1,472,763 \n903,799 \nNon-operating (income) expense\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\n443,230 \n460,293 \n594,954 \nNon-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates\n734 \n1,032 \n23,457 \nOther, net\n(70,573)\n(42,591)\n(82,838)\n \n373,391 \n418,734 \n535,573 \nOperating income\n1,490,456 \n1,891,497 \n1,439,372 \nPreopening and start-up expenses\n7,972 \n415 \n1,876 \nProperty transactions, net\n81,316 \n(370,513)\n(1,036,997)\nDepreciation and amortization\n831,097 \n814,128 \n3,482,050 \nGain on REIT transactions, net\n— \n— \n(2,277,747)\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,410,841 \n$\n2,335,527 \n$\n1,608,554 \nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs of December 31, 2024, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our senior credit facility.

Our foreign subsidiaries, including MGM China and its subsidiaries, are also not guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.\nThe guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee are limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.\n45\nThe summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. \n \nDecember 31, 2024\nBalance Sheet\n(In thousands)\nCurrent assets\n$\n3,045,925 \nIntercompany debt due from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n2,733,770 \nOther long-term assets\n28,683,234 \nOther current liabilities\n2,247,371 \nIntercompany debt due to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n2,199,408 \nOther long-term liabilities\n28,651,188 \n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nIncome Statement\n(In thousands) \nNet revenues\n$\n10,825,067 \nOperating income\n733,665 \nIntercompany interest income\n277,516 \nIntercompany interest expense\n(246,001)\nIncome before income taxes\n501,374 \nNet income\n427,878 \nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International\n396,364 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nCash Flows – Summary\nOur cash flows consisted of the following: \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,362,495 \n$\n2,690,777 \n$\n1,756,462 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n(1,283,163)\n(714,175)\n2,118,181 \nNet cash used in financing activities\n(1,564,281)\n(5,004,631)\n(3,024,302)\nCash Flows \nOperating activities.\n \nTrends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds\n. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.4 billion in 2024 compared to $2.7 billion in 2023. The decrease from the prior year was due primarily to changes in working capital primarily related to payroll liabilities, gaming taxes, and payables, partially offset by the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDAR at MGM China discussed within the Results of Operations section above and a decrease in cash paid for interest and income taxes.\nInvesting activities.\n \nOur investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing properties, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our properties. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing properties can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms\n. \nCash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion in \n2024\n compared to $714 million in \n2023\n. In 2024, we made payments of $1.2 billion in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $182 million to unconsolidated affiliates, \npaid $114 million related to acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and received $223 million related to net short-term investments in debt securities. \nIn comparison, in 2023, we made payments of $932 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $161 million to unconsolidated affiliates, paid $122 million to acquire Push Gaming, \n46\nnet of cash acquired, and made $125 million in net short-term investments in debt securities, which were partially offset by proceeds of $447 million related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica and proceeds of $153 million related to the principal portion of the Circus Circus Las Vegas note receivable that was repaid.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn 2024, we made capital expenditures of $1.2 billion, of which $149 million related to MGM China and\n is inclusive of capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment\n. Capital expenditures primarily related to information technology and room and venue remodels.\nIn 2023, we made capital expenditures of $932 million, of which $45 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of capital expenditures related to the gaming concession investment.

In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of $2.4 billion, as further discussed below, paid $2.3 billion for repurchases of our common stock, and distributed $177 million to noncontrolling interest owners.\nBorrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt\n \nIn 2024, we had net borrowings of debt of $29 million, \nwhich primarily consisted of:\n•\nthe issuance of our $750 million 6.5% notes due 2032, of which the proceeds were used to repay our $750 million of aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% notes due 2025; \n•\nthe issuance of our $850 million 6.125% notes due 2029, of which the proceeds were used to repay our $675 million 5.75% notes due 2025 at a redemption price of 100.607%, with the remainder primarily used for general corporate purposes;\n•\nthe issuance of MGM China’s $500 million 7.125% notes due 2031, of which the proceeds were used to partially repay draws on its first revolving credit facility, which had funded the repayment of MGM China’s $750 million 5.375% notes due 2024; and \n•\nthe net borrowings of $104 million on MGM China’s first revolving credit facility.\nIn 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $2.4 billion, which consisted of the repayment of $1.25 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 6% senior notes due 2023 upon maturity, aggregate net repayments of $1.1 billion on MGM China’s revolving credit facilities, and the early repayment of LeoVegas’s senior notes due 2023 of $36 million. The net repayments of debt were funded with cash on hand.\nShare Repurchases and Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners\n \nIn 2024, we paid $1.4 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. See Note 13 for further information on the stock repurchases. In connection with those repurchases, the February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. The remaining availability under the November 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $826 million as of December 31, 2024. \nIn 2023, we paid $2.3 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. In connection with those repurchases, the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. \nIn March 2024, MGM China’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend for 2023 of $51 million, which was paid in April 2024, of which we received approximately $29 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately $22 million. A final dividend for 2023 of $118 million was declared in March 2024, approved by the shareholders in May 2024, and paid in June 2024, of which we received approximately $66 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately $52 million. In August 2024, MGM China’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $173 million, which was paid in October 2024, of which we received approximately $97 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately $76 million.\n47\nOther\n Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash\nWe require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic properties daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments\n.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion, of which MGM China held $684 million, and \nwe had $6.4 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $3.0 billion related to MGM China. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility or MGM China’s second revolving credit facility, and as of December 31, 2024, there was $478 million outstanding under MGM China’s first revolving credit facility.\n \nIn February 2024, we amended our senior secured credit facility to increase the facility to $2.3 billion and extend the maturity date to February 2029. In May 2024, MGM China further exercised the option to increase the amount of the second revolving facility to its full capacity, as discussed in Note 9.\nOur expected cash interest payments, based on principal amounts of debt outstanding, contractual maturity dates, and interest rates, each as of December 31, 2024, for 2025, 2026, and 2027 are approximately $200 million, $200 million, and $165 million, respectively, excluding MGM China, and approximately $375 million, $310 million, and $215 million, respectively, on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China. \nWe are also required as of December 31, 2024 to make annual contractual cash rent payments of $1.8 billion over the next twelve months under triple net lease agreements, which triple net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us \nto pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance (with each lease obligating us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital expenditures), in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 11 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations.\nWe have planned capital expenditures in 2025 of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion on a consolidated basis, of which\n approximately $225 million to $275 million relates to MGM China and is inclusive of the estimated amount of the gaming concession investment that relates to capital projects. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of MGM Grand Paradise’s commitment to investment in gaming and non-gaming projects and the development of international tourist markets as well as other contractual obligations pursuant to its gaming concession.\nWe continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as expanding our global online gaming presence and pursuing a commercial gaming facility in New York, which may require cash commitments in the future. If our pursuit of a commercial gaming facility in New York is successful, we expect the project cost to be approximately $2 billion, inclusive of a $500 million license fee, with the amount and timing of costs dependent upon the progress and scope of the project and selection process. Additionally, we have cash commitments to fund Osaka IR KK relating to the development of an integrated resort in Osaka, Japan for our proportionate share of the unfinanced portion of Osaka IR KK’s development project, \nof which the estimated remaining amount of approximately 271 billion yen (approximately $1.7 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n) is anticipated to be funded over the next five years\n. We expect \nour funding amount will increase due to inflation and other factors, which increase is subject to ongoing negotiations with contractors and other stakeholders. Refer to Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our commitments and guarantees.\nWe also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately \n9 million\n shares of our common stock\n \nfor an aggregate amount of \n$307 million, excluding excise tax\n. Repurchased shares were retired. \nFor additional information related to our long-term obligations, refer to the maturities of long-term debt table in Note 9, the lease liability maturity table in Note 11, and the discussion regarding commitments and contingencies in Note 12.\nPrincipal Debt Arrangements \nSee Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements.\n48\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where the estimates and assumptions involve both a significant level of estimation uncertainty due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change is high and also have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates. \nLoss Reserve for Casino Receivables\n \nMarker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers by assessing patrons’ credit worthiness prior to issuing credit and we aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic properties who are not residents of the United States. \nWe regularly evaluate our reserve for credit losses for casino receivables, which involves judgments and assumptions about realizability including the age of the account, the customer’s current and expected future financial condition, collection history, current and expected future economic conditions in various geographies, and business conditions. \nThe following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables: \n \nDecember 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In thousands) \nCasino receivables\n$\n603,307\n$\n567,766\nLoss reserve for casino accounts receivable\n121,282\n112,905\nLoss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable\n20 \n%\n20 \n%\nBecause individual customer account balances can be significant, the loss reserve and credit losses can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in economic conditions occur. At December 31, 2024, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino receivables would change income before income taxes by $6 million.\nFixed Asset Capitalization\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense, or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively. \n49\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill, and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\n \nWe evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.\nThere are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. \nOn a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. \nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For our 2024 annual impairment tests, we either utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis and concluded it was more likely than not that fair value exceeded carrying value or we elected to perform a quantitative analysis and fair value exceeded carrying value by a substantial margin. Management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. If future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates, and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions or events outside of our control. \nThe value of our Empire City reporting unit is dependent upon us obtaining a commercial gaming license and the timing thereof, as well as other assumptions that may change throughout the bidding process as additional information becomes known, which includes the size, scope, and timing of constructing an expanded commercial gaming facility, the potential for and timing of a transaction for the monetization of the improvements and the proceeds and any rent associated with such transaction, and the incremental cash flows generated by the expanded facility, such as license payments and other payments to government entities, gaming tax rates, and forecasted revenue and expenses from operations. While the quantitative impairment analysis performed in 2024 resulted in the fair value of Empire City exceeding its carrying value by a substantial margin based upon the assumptions as of the date of the analysis, any of these assumptions could change materially as a result of new or additional information and, if they do, could result in an impairment of up to the full amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill of $256 million.\nSee Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n50\nIncome Taxes\n \nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. \nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences with future tax consequences. We reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such \"more-likely-than-not\" realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies. \nWe reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.\nFurthermore, we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows.\nRefer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes.",
