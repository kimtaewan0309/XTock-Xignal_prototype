Business\nHistory and Development of the Company\nNorwegian commenced operations from Miami, Florida in 1966, launching the modern cruise industry by offering weekly departures from Miami, Florida to destinations in the Caribbean. In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed. In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO and the ordinary shares of NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent company of NCLC. In November 2014, we completed the acquisition of PCI.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, in response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”)’s BEPS 2.0 Pillar 2 global tax reform, the Company restructured its organizational structure by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, Bermuda.  In connection with the reorganization, among other steps, certain NCLH subsidiaries previously domiciled in the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Panama and the state of Delaware, were redomiciled to Bermuda.\nOur Company\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. \nOur brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian’s U.S.-flagged ship, Pride of America, provides the industry’s only entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.\nAll of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities and activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping areas and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as air transportation and hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 32 ships with approximately 66,500 Berths. The Company expects to add 13 additional ships to our fleet from 2025 through 2036. For the Norwegian brand, we have four Prima Class Ships on order with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. For Oceania Cruises, we have one Allura Class Ship on order for delivery in 2025. We also have orders for three new classes of ships: four Oceania Cruises ships with deliveries currently scheduled from 2027 through 2031, two Prestige Class Ships with deliveries currently scheduled in 2026 and 2029 and four Norwegian Cruise Line ships with deliveries currently scheduled from 2030 through 2036. We have the option to cancel the last two ships on order for Oceania Cruises currently scheduled for delivery in 2030 and 2031.\nCorporate Information\nOur registered offices are located at Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. Our principal executive offices are located at 7665 Corporate Center Drive, Miami, Florida 33126. Daniel S. Farkas, the Company’s Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Development Officer and Secretary, is our agent for service of process at our principal executive offices.\n​\n8\n\n\nTable of

strategy is based on four pillars and bolstered by our commitment to sustainability.  \nPeople Excellence\nWe seek to foster a culture based on innovation, collaboration, transparency and passion while supporting our team members to reach their full potential by developing talent both shoreside and shipside.\nGuest Centric Product Offering\nWe seek to deliver vacations that our guests value, providing digital and other tools to make it easier for them to curate their experience throughout the customer journey. We are focused on delivering exceptional onboard experiences, focusing on capturing more pre-cruise spend.\nLong-term Growth Platform\n \n​\nWe seek to expand only into offerings that matter most to our current and future guests and that deliver meaningful experiences and improve returns. For example, we are building larger, more efficient vessels to drive returns while enhancing the guest experience. Additionally, we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation. \n​\nExceptional Performance\n​\nWe are focused on pricing optimization, cost excellence and operating responsibly to generate enhanced returns. We are currently undergoing a broad and ongoing effort to improve operating efficiencies, including cost minimization initiatives, allowing us to progress towards achieving lower leverage. \n​\nOur Commitment to Sustainability \n​\nOur global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, is centered around our commitment to drive a positive impact on society and the environment while delivering on our vision to be the vacation of choice for everyone around the world.\n​\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy:\n​\nClearly Defined Brands\n​\nOur portfolio of three award-winning brands operates a combined 32 ships ranging in size from approximately 500 to over 4,000 Berths.\n​\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNorwegian’s ships cater to a variety of travelers with up to 20 dining options; various attractions, including the world’s only racetracks at sea; a wide array of entertainment options; full-service spas at sea; and a diverse range of accommodations, including luxury suites in The Haven, studio staterooms designed and priced for the solo traveler and everything in between. Oceania Cruises’ award-winning onboard dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise experience. Regent’s all-inclusive fare includes unlimited shore excursions in every port, a one-night pre-cruise hotel package in Concierge Suites and higher, specialty dining, unlimited premium beverages, including fine wines and spirits, pre-paid gratuities, unlimited Starlink Wi-Fi, valet laundry service and other amenities. Regent also offers an Ultimate All-Inclusive Air option, which includes the previously stated amenities plus flights with the flexibility to choose the desired air class, transfers between airport and ship and a private executive chauffer credit for private transfers. \nUpscale Guest Demographic\nOur target demographic consists primarily of high-net-worth travelers who appreciate upscale experiences. This customer base has proven to be resilient during economic downturns and demonstrates strong repeat booking patterns.\nDiversified Itinerary Mix\nWe have a wide variety of itineraries to over 700 ports around the world. Our brands offer diverse itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, the Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii.\nStrong Growth Profile\n​\nWe believe our strategic fleet expansion program, including new ship orders and the modernization of existing vessels, positions us for sustained growth. We maintain a disciplined approach to capacity growth while focusing on yield optimization and cost control. \n​\nProven Model \n​\nOur business model has demonstrated resilience through various market cycles. We maintain strong relationships with travel partners, have sophisticated revenue management strategies, and focus on operational excellence to drive shareholder value.\n​\nReduce leverage and optimize our balance sheet\nIn 2024 and 2025, we continued to take actions to improve our capital structure as part of our long-term financial strategy.\n●\nIn September 2024, NCLC issued $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2030.  The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\n●\nIn January 2025, the full amount of outstanding borrowings under the Breakaway one loan, Breakaway two loan, Marina newbuild loan and Riviera newbuild loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid.\n●\nAlso in January 2025, NCLC issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2032. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to pay any related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. \n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nAdditionally in January 2025, the Revolving Loan Facility was increased from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion with the maturity date extended to 2030, and the collateral of the Revolving Loan Facility and the 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029 were modified. \nRefer to Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for further details about the above transactions.\nDisciplined Fleet Expansion\nFor the Norwegian brand, we have four Prima Class Ships on order with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. The third and fourth Prima Class Ships will be approximately 156,000 Gross Tons with 3,550 Berths, and the fifth and sixth Prima Class Ships will be approximately 169,000 Gross Tons with 3,850 Berths. For the Norwegian brand, we also have an order for four additional ships, each at approximately 225,000 Gross Tons and 5,150 Berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2030 through 2036. For the Oceania Cruises brand, we have an order for one Allura Class Ship to be delivered in 2025, which will be approximately 68,000 Gross Tons and 1,200 Berths. For the Oceania Cruises brand, we also have an order for four additional ships (which includes two ships on order, which are currently scheduled for delivery in 2030 and 2031, that we have the option to cancel), each at approximately 86,000 Gross Tons and 1,450 Berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2027 through 2031. For the Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand, we have an order for two Prestige Class Ships, each at approximately 77,000 Gross Tons and 850 Berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates in 2026 and 2029. The impacts of initiatives to improve environmental sustainability and modifications the Company plans to make to its newbuilds and/or other macroeconomic conditions and events have resulted in delays in expected ship deliveries. These and other impacts could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged.\nWe believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands, position us for accelerated growth and provide an optimized return on invested capital. For ships on order, excluding the two ships on order for Oceania Cruises that we have the option to cancel and the four additional ships on order for Norwegian Cruise Line with currently scheduled delivery from 2030 to 2036, we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship as well as related financing premiums, subject to certain conditions.\nOur Commitment to Sustainability \n​\nThe continued success of our business is linked to our ability to operate and grow sustainably. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain. The Sail & Sustain program is centered around five pillars: Reducing Environmental Impact, Sailing Safely, Empowering People, Strengthening Our Communities and Operating with Integrity and Accountability. The Company’s Board of Directors is actively engaged in overseeing the Sail & Sustain program, strategy and its implementation through its Technology, Environmental, Safety & Security Committee. \n​\nReducing our environmental impact is a key component of the Sail & Sustain program. The backbone of our ships’ environmental programs is our ISO 14001 – certified Environmental Management System. This voluntary standard sets requirements for the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system and helps us systematically identify, manage and control activities related to our environmental performance, manage progress toward our environmental goals and comply with applicable regulations. \n​\nAs part of our environmental commitment, we are pursuing net zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2050 across our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) and value chain (Scope 3). We have set interim targets to guide us on our path to net zero and provide more details about them in our annual Sail & Sustain report (which does not constitute a part of, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report).\n​\nThe three components of our climate action strategy are Efficiency, Innovation and Collaboration. Each ship in our fleet has a Shipboard Energy Efficiency Management Plan with the objective to improve the overall operating efficiency of the ship by implementing methods for energy and fuel savings. We evaluate, monitor, and implement energy-savings \n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nprojects on our existing ships including but not limited to HVAC system upgrades, LED lighting, hydrodynamic upgrades, and waste heat recovery projects.\n​\nThe path towards net zero is complex, and this effort will require significant technological advancements including commercially viable and scalable low or zero GHG emission fuels, but we are committed to doing our part to facilitate this transition. For example, we successfully surpassed our 2024 goal of testing the use of biofuel blends on 40% of our fleet by testing biofuel blends on approximately 47% of our fleet. Biofuels can be blended with traditional marine fuels to support a reduction of lifecycle GHG emissions. This blend is often considered a drop-in fuel for existing vessels and engines and the use of biofuels does not require modifications to existing engines. Though biofuels are not expected to be a commercially viable long-term solution, we believe they are viable transition fuels that can support the decarbonization journey as long-term solutions are tested and scaled. We are also investing in shore power technology, which with the appropriate port infrastructure would allow us to connect to onshore electrical power grids to supply much of the power needed while docked. A total of 19 ships in our fleet, or approximately 59%, are currently equipped with shore power technology, and we are targeting approximately 70% of our fleet to be equipped by year-end 2025. To prepare for a long-term transition towards net zero, we have lengthened and reconfigured the designs for the final two Prima Class ships, expected to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, to accommodate the use of green methanol as a future fuel source. While additional modifications will be needed to fully enable the use of green methanol, these modifications represent an important step forward in the pursuit of net zero by 2050.\n​\nWe also drive social impact through our philanthropy initiatives, partnerships and community engagement programs. As a leading global cruise line, our success is dependent on the wellbeing and vibrancy of the destinations we visit across the globe. We strive to be a great partner to each destination we visit, working together to find sustainable, long-term solutions for the communities, while at the same time allowing our guests to experience all that these incredible destinations have to offer.\n​\nWe provide regular updates to our stakeholders on our sustainability efforts and promote awareness on important topics through our Sail & Sustain program, our annual Sail & Sustain report and through various communications regarding important sustainability initiatives across distribution channels, including, but not limited to, press releases, social media and our corporate website. We have published disclosures aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework as well as the recommendations outlined in the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework to provide additional transparency to our stakeholders. Climate-related risks, greenhouse gas information and details of our climate action strategy are disclosed in our annual Sail & Sustain report and annual submission to CDP (which does not constitute a part of, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report), which can be found on our website. For additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives, please visit our website at https://www.nclhltd.com/sustainability.\n​\nHighly Experienced Management Team\n​\nOur senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. See “Information about our Executive Officers” below for more information on our highly experienced management team.\n​\nPassenger Ticket Revenue\n​\nWe offer our guests a wide variety of options when booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and an array of onboard activities and amenities, meals, entertainment and government taxes, fees and port expenses. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, internet, valet laundry services, pre-cruise hotel packages, as well as pre- or post-cruise land packages at many destinations we sail to around the world. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, voyage length, stateroom category selected, added inclusions and the time of year that the sailing takes place.\n​\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOnboard and Other Revenue\nAll three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, spa services, communication services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and communication services may be managed through contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions. Norwegian’s ticket prices typically include meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities and various sports programs. To maximize onboard revenue, all three brands use various cross-marketing and promotional tools which are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services. Oceania Cruises’ ticket prices include specialty dining, entertainment, Starlink Wi-Fi, laundry, gratuities and certain other amenities. Regent’s ticket prices typically include onboard amenities such as unlimited complimentary shore excursions, beverages including fine wines and liquors, entertainment, specialty dining, Starlink Wi-Fi, valet laundry, gratuities and more. \nSeasonality\nOur operations are seasonal and results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year. Historically, demand for cruises has been strongest during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months, which has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.\nCompetition\nOur primary competition includes operators such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean as well as other cruise lines such as MSC Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises and Virgin Voyages. In addition, we compete with land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership properties, casinos, and tourist destinations throughout the world.\nShip Operations and Cruise Infrastructure\nShip Maintenance and Logistics\nSophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical capabilities and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately every 24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in Dry-dock. Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under these regulations, it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel) or twice in five years (depending on flag state and age of vessel), and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed three years (depending on flag state and age of vessel). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by The Bahamas and/or Marshall Islands (flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to Dry-dock once every five years. To the extent practical, each ship’s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability. We typically take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas of both guest-facing services and innovative compliance technology.\nSuppliers\nOur largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition. Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related (including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services), fuel, airfare, food and \n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbeverage, advertising and marketing and travel advisor services. Most of the supplies that we require are typically available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, due to the large quantities that we purchase, we typically can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases for ship construction expenditures are generally denominated in euros and other purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.\nCrew and Staff\nBest-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate, where travelers have discerning tastes and high expectations for quality service. We have dedicated resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives, we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew, helping to build customer loyalty.\nWe place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests, crew and the communities we visit. We operate all our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”), the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry. Crew members are trained in the Company’s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety trainings, exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships to familiarize themselves and become proficient with the safety equipment onboard. We developed Infectious Disease Management Protocols, which were certified and audited to DNV’s Certification in Infection Prevention, to further enhance our outbreak prevention and response to all types of infectious disease including, but not limited to COVID-19, norovirus, acute gastroenteritis, influenza and influenza-like illnesses.\n​\nOur NCLH Wellness at Sea initiative is designed to create a wellness-conscious work environment on our ships. We are committed to providing crew members with guidelines, resources, and activities for educational purposes and to help them achieve optimal wellness. Topics in this initiative address, among other things, nutrition, physical activity, sleep and stress management and alcohol and tobacco awareness.\n​\nOur captains and chief engineers are experienced seafarers. Our bridge and technical officers regularly undergo rigorous operations training such as leadership, navigation, stability, statutory and environmental regulatory compliance. To support our deck and engine officers while at sea, we have bridge and engine protocols and support documentation in place, dictating specific standard operating procedures. Our bridge teams conduct a voyage planning process prior to sailing, where the upcoming itinerary is reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to departure and in preparation for arrival. In addition, all of our ships employ state-of-the-art navigational equipment and technology to provide our bridge teams with accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.\nPrior to every cruise setting sail, we show a safety video, which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions, and familiarize guests with their muster stations and important safety information. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems. We have developed a Safety Management System (“SMS”), which establishes policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high-quality operation of the fleet. Our SMS is approved and audited regularly by our classification society, and it also undergoes regular internal audits as well as periodic inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities. \nInsurance\nWe maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:\n●\nProtection and indemnity insurance (coverage for passenger, crew and third-party liabilities), including insurance against risk of pollution liabilities;\n●\nWar risk insurance, including terrorist risk insurance. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions where underwriters can give seven days’ notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk which is typical for policies in the marine industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven-day period, submit new terms; and\n●\nInsurance for our shoreside property, cybersecurity, directors and officers, general liability risks and other insurance coverages.\nOur insurance coverage, including those noted above, is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.\nTrademarks and Trade Names\nUnder the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE” and “FEEL FREE,” the names of our ships (except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.” We believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout North America, Europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value.\nUnder the Oceania Cruises brand, we own rights in a number of trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “OCEANIA CRUISES” and its logo, “FINEST CUISINE AT SEA,” and “YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY,” as well as in the names of our ships.\nUnder the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “SEVEN SEAS CRUISES,” “AN UNRIVALED EXPERIENCE,” and “THE MOST INCLUSIVE LUXURY EXPERIENCE” as well as the names of our ships (except where trademark applications have been filed and are pending). \nWe also claim common law rights in trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships for each of our brands. \nThe Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand since 2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011, granting us the right to use the “Regent” brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent to use the Regent trade name, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement.\nRegulatory Matters\nRegistration of Our Ships\nTwenty-one of the ships that we currently operate are registered in The Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Ten of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands. Our ships registered in The Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall Islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.\nEconomic Substance Requirements\nNCLH and NCLC are exempted companies formed under the laws of Bermuda and some of their subsidiaries have been formed or continued in Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, St. Lucia or The Bahamas. Pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction, entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out “relevant activities” as specified in such laws, are required to demonstrate adequate economic substance in that jurisdiction and meet the economic substance requirements under such laws.  In general terms, such economic substance requirements mean that: (i) the entity must be actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction; (ii) core income-generating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity must be performed in the jurisdiction; (iii) there are adequate suitably qualified employees in the jurisdiction; (iv) the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction; and (v) there is adequate operating expenditure incurred in the jurisdiction. We have evaluated the activities of NCLH, NCLC and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases, those activities are “relevant activities” for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that, consequently, certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions. If such entities cannot demonstrate compliance with these requirements, we may be liable to pay penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions and/or may take the decision to re-domicile such entities to different jurisdictions. We took what we believe were the necessary steps to meet Bermuda’s economic substance requirements during 2024.\nEnvironmental Protection\nOur ships are subject to various international, national, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those that govern air emissions, waste discharge, wastewater management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways, and we must adhere to various water and air quality-related requirements. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes, and currently contains six annexes, four of which are applicable to cruise ships.\nWith regard to air quality requirements, MARPOL Annex VI sets a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5%. Various compliance methods, such as the use of alternative fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur oxide (“SOx”) emissions, may be utilized. Annex VI also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, North American waters and the U.S. Caribbean Sea. Ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. ECAs have also been established to limit emissions of oxides of nitrogen (“NOx”) from newly built ships with keel lay dates after January 1, 2016. Under MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 14, the Mediterranean Sea will become an ECA with new limits on SOx taking effect on May 1, 2025. The NOx emissions limit for the Canadian Arctic ECA will apply to newly built ships that are at the beginning stage of construction on or after January 1, 2025. The NOx emissions limit for the Norwegian Sea ECA will apply to newly built ships for which the building contract was entered into on or after March 1, 2026, or, in the absence of a ship building contract, with keel lay dates on or after September 1, 2026 or delivery dates on or after March 1, 2030. Additional ECAs may also be established in the future.\nBallast water discharges are governed by the MARPOL Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into force in 2017 (the “Convention”), and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships. Ballast water, which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization, may contain a variety of marine species. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new, different, \n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nor potentially unsuitable environments. Applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species.\nMARPOL also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage, oil and sewage from ships, including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges, and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling. Ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land. Governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage, without causing delay to ships. Ships are required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants, disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks.\nAmendments to MARPOL have made the Baltic Sea a MARPOL Annex IV “Special Area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships are prohibited unless they comply with Resolution MEPC 227(64) adopted by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) of the IMO. Stricter discharge restrictions went into effect for new passenger ships in 2019, and for existing passenger ships in 2021.\nIn the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and regulations, provide the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the U.S. Coast Guard with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally-protected waters. The U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) program, authorized by the Clean Water Act, was established to reduce pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the NPDES requirements are set forth in the EPA’s Vessel General Permit (“VGP”). The VGP establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge- and vessel-specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. In 2018, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which will eventually replace the VGP, was signed into law, and the EPA published a  final rule in October 2024 establishing national standards of performance under the VIDA that apply to 20 different types of vessel equipment and systems, as well as general discharge standards that apply to all types of vessel incidental discharges within 12 nautical miles of the United States. The VGP will continue to govern until the U.S. Coast Guard publishes implementing regulations for the final VIDA rule, which it must publish by October 2026. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements certain elements of MARPOL in the U.S., provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”).\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship.  Our continued OPA 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance.\nMany coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and, in some cases, the laws have no statutory limits of liability. Among the most stringent requirements are those set by the State of Alaska, which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.\nThe European Union (“E.U.”) has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the E.U. has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.\nWith regard to air emissions from seagoing ships, the E.U. requires the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in E.U. ports. All non-ECA waters have a 0.5% fuel sulfur limit.\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe European Commission has also implemented regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from maritime shipping through a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (“MRV”) regulation, which requires ships over 5,000 Gross Tons to monitor and report carbon emissions on all voyages to, from and between E.U. ports as well as ports in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). As of January 1, 2024, the E.U. MRV regulation is requiring carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions to be reported.\nAs part of its Fit for 55 package, the E.U. is in the process of adopting several rules aimed at reducing GHG emissions. Two of the mechanisms that are being used to achieve emissions reductions are the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) and the FuelEU Maritime Initiative. We expect to have increased costs associated with the Fit for 55 regulations but are not able to quantify the impact yet as the impact will depend on future market pricing. In addition, strategies to reduce GHG emissions as well as ship deployment modifications could mitigate the impact of these regulations.   \n●\nETS: The maritime transport sector was approved to be included in the scope of the ETS. Effective January 2024, ships over 5,000 Gross Tons that transport passengers or cargo to or from E.U. or EEA ports are required to purchase and surrender emissions allowances equivalent to emissions for all or a half of a covered voyage, depending on whether the voyage was between two E.U. or EEA ports or an E.U. or EEA and a non-E.U. or EEA port. The requirements are being phased in from 2024 to 2026. Covered entities are required to procure and surrender allowances equivalent to 40% of their verified carbon emissions from 2024, with the amount increasing to 70% of carbon emissions from 2025 and 100% of GHG emissions from 2026, with allowances to be surrendered by September in the following year. The costs associated with the purchase of allowances are variable and depend on future market movements, and the number of allowances we will be required to purchase will be influenced by our decarbonization efforts; however, the costs are not expected to have a material impact on net income as a portion will be collected from passengers. \n​\n●\nFuelEU Maritime Initiative: Adopted in 2023, the FuelEU regulation sets a maximum limit on the annual average GHG intensity of onboard energy usage for ships over 5,000 Gross Tons arriving at, sailing in or departing from ports in the E.U. or EEA, based on 2020 reference levels. The reduction required will become progressively stricter over time starting with a 2% intensity reduction in 2025 to as much as 80% intensity reduction by 2050. Other key components of the regulation include requirements for connecting to onshore power grids in Trans-European Transport Network ports by 2030 as well as targets for the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin. The new rules began to apply on January 1, 2025, and there are financial penalties for non-compliance.\nThe IMO implemented a variety of measures to support the targets of the initial 2018 GHG strategy. In 2021, the IMO adopted two new requirements, which went into effect in 2023, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (the “CII”) and Energy Efficiency Ship Index (the “EEXI”). The CII is an operational metric designed to measure how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers by looking at carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile. Ships are given an annual rating from A to E with a C or better required for compliance. For ships that receive a D rating for three consecutive years, or an E rating for one year, a corrective action plan will need to be developed and approved. Beginning in 2023, ships are now required to reduce carbon intensity by 5% from a 2019 baseline, with 2% incremental improvements each year thereafter until 2030. The enforcement mechanism for CII has not yet been defined, but the IMO plans to address this enforcement gap and make other modifications to the CII in 2025. The EEXI is a one-time design re-certification requirement that updates energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and regulates carbon dioxide emissions related to installed engine power, transport capacity and ship speed. Ongoing compliance with the EEXI is not expected to have a material impact on our operations.\nIn 2023, the IMO revised its 2018 GHG strategy with three ambitions: a reduction in carbon intensity of international shipping by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 2008; an uptake of zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuel and/or energy sources to represent at least 5%, striving for 10%, of the energy used by 2030; and, GHG emissions from international shipping to reach net zero by or around 2050. The strategy also set out indicative checkpoints, both relative to 2008, including a reduction of the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20%, striving for 30%, by 2030, and by at least 70%, striving for 80%, by 2040. The IMO also decided to develop a basket of measures to support the revised ambitions consisting of two parts: a technical element which will be a goal-based marine fuel standard regulating the phased reduction of marine fuel GHG intensity, and an economic element which may be \n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsome form of a maritime GHG emissions pricing mechanism. The IMO will continue to develop these measures and according to the agreed timeline, the measures are expected to be adopted in late 2025 and enter into force in around mid-2027.\nCompliance with such laws and regulations has resulted in increased costs to our Company and is expected to entail significant expenses for a combination of: ship modifications, purchases of emissions allowances, alternative fuels and higher-cost compliant newbuilds. Compliance is also expected to result in changes to our operating procedures, including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations and slowing the speed of our ships, and may render some ships obsolete, which would adversely impact our operations. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. Some environmental groups continue to lobby for more stringent restrictions of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact.\nIf we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flow or financial condition. We expect to make material investments in our business to comply with these laws and regulations; however, the total impact cannot be determined as we are evaluating our compliance plans.\nWe refer you to “—Our Business Strategy and Competitive Strengths — Our Commitment to Sustainability” for information related to our sustainability strategy.\nPermits for Glacier Bay, Alaska\nIn connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, we rely on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate our ships in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. We currently hold a concession permit allowing for 41 calls annually through September 30, 2029. \nPassenger and Crew Well-Being\nIn the U.S., we must meet the U.S. Public Health Service’s requirements, which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the CDC and the FDA. In addition, the cruise industry and the U.S. Public Health Service have agreed on regulations for food, water and hygiene, aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to U.S. ports.\nWe continue to work directly with the CDC Maritime Unit as well as other health regulatory authorities, such as E.U. Healthy Gateways, to adjust our infectious disease (e.g., COVID-19, influenza, and norovirus) response protocols. \nSecurity and Safety\nThe IMO has adopted safety standards as part of the SOLAS convention, which apply to all our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises pursuant to international and national maritime regulations.\nSOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the ISM Code. All of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (“ISPS Code”) was adopted by the IMO in December 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping companies.\n​\nAmendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO also adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification and Tracking. All our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying date.\nIn addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) which implements a number of security measures at ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. while docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S., provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a U.S. requirement for accessibility into and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.\nMaritime-Labor\nIn 2006, the International Labor Organization (“ILO”), an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements, such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers, as amended (“STCW”), establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watch-keeping for our seafarers.\nFinancial Requirements\nThe Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands is required to maintain a $32.0 million third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. \nIn addition, our brands have a legal requirement to maintain security guarantees based on cruise business originated from the U.K., and certain jurisdictions require us to establish financial responsibility to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, we have in place approximately £65.1 million of security guarantees for our brands as well as a consumer protection policy covering up to £141.1 million. The Company has provided approximately $1.4 million in cash to secure all the financial security guarantees required.\nCompliance with these regulations has had an impact on our financial condition. From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry in general. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.\nFor information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, see “Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled “We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety, labor, data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations, which \n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncould adversely affect our operations and certain recently introduced laws and regulations and future changes in laws and regulations could lead to increased costs and/or decreased revenue.”\nTaxation\nU.S. Income Taxation\nThe following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below.\nExemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code\nUnder Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”) and the related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived from the international operation of ships (“shipping income”) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value of its stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the “publicly-traded test”); or (3) it is a “controlled foreign corporation” (a “CFC”) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the “CFC test”). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements.\nNCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, which is a qualified foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly-traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).  The NYSE is considered to be an established securities market in the United States. Therefore, we believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.\nWe believe and have taken the position that substantially all of NCLH’s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS’ interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883. There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this matter.\nUnder certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence or holdings of NCLH’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter, NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly-traded test by prohibiting any person from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of NCLH’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by NCLH’s Board of Directors (the “4.9% limit”). Any outstanding shares held in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883 as discussed above.\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTaxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883 of the Code is Inapplicable\nUnless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the United States. If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S.-sourced shipping income, or if the provision was repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.\nGenerally, “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States, which we refer to as “U.S.-source shipping income,” will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the United States.\nIf we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 21% rate) and state and local taxes, and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax and branch-level interest tax of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies (the “Net Tax Regime”). Our U.S.-source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of U.S.-source shipping income, and substantially all of our U.S.-source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.\nIf we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our gross U.S.-source shipping income (the “4% Tax Regime”).\nOther United States Taxation\nU.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre- and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income.\nIncome from U.S.-flagged Operations\nIncome derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels. In addition, any dividends paid by our U.S.-flagged operations to NCLC would be considered subject to a dividend withholding tax of 30%. \nBermuda Income Taxation\nPreviously, NCLH, NCLC and their Bermuda subsidiaries obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that any legislation was enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax, including tax on profits or income among others, such tax would not be applicable to them until March 31, 2035.  Such assurances were superseded by the passage of new legislation as described below.  \nOn December 27, 2023, the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“the Bermuda Act”) was enacted in Bermuda.  Under the Bermuda Act, the corporate income tax will be determined based on a statutory tax rate of 15% effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The corporate income tax will apply only to Bermuda tax resident businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with €750 million or more in annual revenues in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the year in question. Although the Government of Bermuda has released limited guidance \n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwith respect to specific provisions of the Bermuda Act, it is anticipated that further administrative guidance as well as regulatory guidance will be released over the course of the 2025 calendar year and beyond. \nAs enacted, the Bermuda Act makes it clear that any corporate income tax liability is due regardless of the above assurances under the Exempted Undertakings Protection Act 1966. Therefore, NCLH, NCLC and their Bermuda subsidiaries became subject to the Bermuda corporate income tax effective as of January 1, 2025.\nThe Bermuda Act provides for an international shipping income exclusion. In order for a Bermuda entity’s international shipping income to qualify for the exclusion, the entity must demonstrate that the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on from or within Bermuda. NCLH believes it met the necessary requirements to qualify for the international shipping income exclusion during 2024.\nAdditionally, the Bermuda Act provides for companies to be able to offset 80% of their Bermuda taxable income with any tax loss deductions available on an annual basis. The Bermuda Act provides for opening tax loss carryforwards based on the Bermuda taxable income (loss) results of the individual Bermuda entities in the five fiscal years prior to the enactment date, which includes the 2020 through 2024 calendar years for Norwegian. These tax loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. Refer to Note 12 – “Income Taxes” for more information.\nU.K. Income Taxation\nSome of our subsidiaries which are incorporated in the U.K. are subject to normal U.K. corporation tax.\nCertain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters\nWe may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.\nChanges in Tax Laws\nThe various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover, we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law. For example, the OECD and numerous jurisdictions have had an increased focus on issues concerning the taxation of multinational businesses and have adopted several related reforms including the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational businesses that was effective January 1, 2024 or later, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these developments in global tax reform, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company realigned its organizational structure in Bermuda due to the inclusion of the international shipping income exclusion in the Bermuda Act, which we believe provides an ability for the Company to exempt a significant amount of its income from Bermuda income tax. We expect global tax reform will continue to evolve over the coming years, and we will continue to monitor any new developments and assess impacts to the Company.\nHuman Capital\nOur people are the driving force of our past, current and future success. We aim to empower our team members worldwide, providing them opportunities to grow and develop, and comprehensive benefits that support them to thrive both physically and mentally. We believe this commitment to empower people allows us to attract and retain top talent, while simultaneously providing robust career development opportunities that ultimately result in significant value to our Company. \n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, the Company announced our Charting the Course strategy, setting People Excellence as the first strategic pillar furthering our commitment to fostering a culture based on our value anchors of Collaboration, Innovation, Transparency and Passion while supporting our team members to reach their full potential. We believe this commitment ultimately results in significant value to our Company and its shareholders. \nTeam Members\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 5,200 full-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 36,500 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises’ ships use a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant staffing onboard. We refer you to “Item 1A—Risk Factors— Our failure or inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCritical to our success is identifying, recruiting and retaining top talent and incentivizing existing and future team members.  We attract and retain talented team members by offering competitive compensation and benefits. Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy for our shoreside team is based on rewarding each team member’s individual contributions. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay components including base salary, bonus, equity, commissions and merit increases. We maintain a long-term incentive plan for our manager-level team members and above that allows us to provide share-based compensation to enhance our pay-for-performance culture and to support our attraction, retention and motivational goals. We have established an $18 per hour minimum wage for our non-commission U.S.-based shoreside employees. We also issued an appreciation bonus of up to 10 days of pay to non-management employees not eligible under other bonus or incentive programs. The Company also consistently reviews salary levels in order to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining talent for shoreside and shipboard employees. We believe our compensation programs for our shipboard team are competitive and for the majority of this team, negotiated with various unions and documented in collective bargaining agreements. \nThe success of our Company is connected to the well-being of our team members, such that we offer a competitive benefits package including physical, financial and emotional well-being benefits.

Our benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local requirements and to be competitive in the marketplace. As we strive to be an employer of choice, the Company continues with a 4/1 flexible work model for shoreside team members globally. The flexible model allows most employees to work in-office Monday through Thursday and remotely on Friday.\nWe proudly offer Family Care Benefits to our eligible shoreside employees that includes paid leave at 100% of an employee’s salary for maternity, paternity, and adoption leaves. Family planning assistance for fertility/surrogacy services and adoption support are also offered. In 2024, As a result of productive focus groups and listening sessions that took place with workplace parents, enhancements to NCLH’s Family Care Benefits, particularly the maternity program, were reviewed and approved for implementation in 2024. A maternity return to work transition program was established to provide a smooth transition to the office following the medical leave. We also introduced a new free women’s menopause support benefit to our team members. In 2024, we opened a new onsite clinic at our corporate headquarters to make healthcare more accessible and convenient for our team members, offering a range of services from physical exams, immunizations, basic diagnostic testing, and low-cost prescription medication. \nThe Company continues to offer a robust team member Norwegian cruise benefit to our full time shoreside team members which offers 95% off one cruise per year, along with substantial discounts for additional cruises. Our cruise benefit programs were further enhanced for team member’s friends and family across our brands. \n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to offer the NCLH Wellness at Sea program to all shipboard team members, creating a wellness-conscious work environment on the vessels.

The 6-month program is conducted with a human resources strategy firm and is focused on developing a growth mindset to refine leadership strengths, champion change and encourage innovation through assessment tools, one-on-one coaching and group learning. We have had successful rates of promotion and retention of Rising Stars graduates. \nIn 2024, we enhanced our learning and development program, by offering all shoreside team members access to premiere online learning for a wide range of personal development courses at their own pace. We also launched our new NCLH Executive Academy for our shoreside officers, supporting our Charting the Course strategy and development of key leadership attributes identified in our talent review process. The cohort learning program is delivered in six modules by experienced university faculty. \nShipboard team members have the opportunity to learn the skills and responsibilities of another position in a different department, either to increase their effectiveness in the Company, or to give them the opportunity to shift their career path.\nRetention and Engagement\nWe have a history of strong retention rates across our shoreside and shipboard teams which we attribute to our culture that allows our team members to thrive and achieve their career goals. For the full year of 2024, the Company experienced its highest shoreside voluntary retention rate as compared to the prior four years.\nExceptional team members continue to be recognized by a robust annual Award of Excellence recognition program which acknowledges and rewards individual team members and teams for their demonstration of Company values.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFinancial Presentation\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results. You should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. See also “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” immediately prior to Part I, Item 1 in this Annual Report.\nWe categorize revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue. Passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates. Our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. Passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations, meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, government taxes, fees and port expenses and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. Onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa services and Wi-Fi services. Our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires, from which we receive a share of their revenue.\nOur cruise operating expense is classified as follows:\n●\nCommissions, transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue. These costs include travel advisor commissions, air and land transportation expenses, related credit card fees, certain government taxes, fees and port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price.\n●\nOnboard and other primarily consists of direct costs incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue, including casino, beverage sales and shore excursions.\n●\nPayroll and related consists of the cost of wages, benefits and logistics for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items, including food, for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships. \n●\nFuel includes fuel costs, the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs.\n●\nFood consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships.\n●\nOther consists of repairs and maintenance (including Dry-dock costs), ship insurance and other ship expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies, which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, relate to ship accounting and asset impairment.\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nShip Accounting\nShips represent our most significant assets, and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the weighted average useful lives of primarily 30 years after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship. Our residual value is established based on our long-term estimates of the expected remaining future benefit at the end of the ships’ weighted average useful lives. In 2022 and 2023, the Company took delivery of Norwegian’s first Prima Class Ship and Oceania Cruises’ first Allura Class Ship, respectively. Based on the design, structure and technological advancements made to these new classes of ships and the analyses of their major components, which is generally performed upon the introduction of a new class of ship, we have assigned the Prima Class Ships and Allura Class Ships a weighted-average useful life of 35 years with a residual value of 10%. Ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship. When we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ship’s cost basis, we estimate the net book value of the component being retired and remove it from the ship’s cost basis. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. We account for Dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all Dry-dock costs as incurred.\nWe determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the costs and useful lives of the ships’ major component systems on the date of acquisition, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric, superstructure and hull, and their related proportional weighting to the ship as a whole. The useful lives of components of new ships and ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components. In addition, to determine the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements, we consider the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives, planned maintenance programs and anticipated changes in technological conditions. Given the large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require judgment and are uncertain. Should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher. \nIf circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we reduced our estimated weighted average ship service life by one year, depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have increased by $20.5 million. In addition, if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $89.7 million. We believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied. We believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage.\nAsset Impairment\nWe review our long-lived assets, principally ships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. For ship impairment analyses, the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities is each individual ship. We consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. Our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk.\nWe evaluate goodwill and trade names for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. For our evaluation of goodwill, we use a qualitative assessment which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is \n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmore likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For trade names we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment.\nIn order to make this evaluation, we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist:\n●\nChanges in general macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;\n●\nChanges in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity’s products or services; or a regulatory or political development;\n●\nChanges in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;\n●\nDecline in overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);\n●\nEntity and reporting unit specific negative events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and\n●\nDecline in share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).\nIt is at our discretion whether to perform the qualitative test and we may bypass the qualitative test in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. We may also, at our discretion, resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.\nWe believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived assets, principally ships, goodwill, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless, if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. If a material change occurred or the result of the qualitative assessment indicated it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, we would conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value to its carrying value. \nWe have concluded that our business has three reporting units. Each brand, Oceania Cruises, Regent and Norwegian, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment. \nFor our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a qualitative assessment for the Norwegian and Regent reporting units and for each brand’s trade names. As of December 31, 2024, there was $135.8 million of goodwill for the Regent and Norwegian reporting units. Trade names were $500.5 million as of December 31, 2024. As of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment reviews support the carrying values of these assets. See Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terms Used in this Annual Report” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis because it reflects revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that \n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\npositively impacts our net income, we believe changes in Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. \nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income, as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we had a benefit of $161.9 million related to the reversal of the majority of our U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income since the benefit is not representative of our day-to-day operations, and this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within this Annual Report.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “Results of Operations” section.\nFinancing Transactions and Newbuild Orders\nIn February 2024, NCLC and the Commitment Parties entered into the third amended commitment letter, which became effective in March 2024. Pursuant to the third amended commitment letter, the Commitment Parties have agreed to purchase from NCLC an aggregate principal amount of $650 million of senior unsecured notes due five years after the issue date at NCLC’s option, which option is available through March 2025 and we do not expect to extend. In connection with the execution of the third amended commitment letter, NCLC agreed to repurchase all of the outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028 at a negotiated premium plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. See Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for more information.\n​\nIn April 2024, we obtained export credit financing for 80% of the contract price of two new Regent Seven Seas Cruises ship orders and two new Oceania Cruises ship orders as well as related premiums. Contemporaneously, the ship orders became effective. The Norwegian brand also placed a four-ship order, for which the shipbuilding contracts were finalized in February 2025 and financing is still being finalized. We refer you to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources— Future Capital Commitments” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources— Material Cash Requirements” for details regarding our newbuild orders.\n​\nAdditionally, in April 2024, a €200 million commitment became available that can be used for future newbuild payments.  See Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for more information.\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\nIn September 2024, NCLC issued $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2030.  The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. See Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for more information.\n​\nIn January 2025, the full amount of outstanding borrowings under the Breakaway one loan, Breakaway two loan, Marina newbuild loan and Riviera newbuild loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid with funds drawn from the Revolving Loan Facility. NCLC also issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2032. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to pay any related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. Concurrently, the Revolving Loan Facility was increased from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion with the maturity date extended to 2030 and the collateral of the Revolving Loan Facility and the 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029 were modified. See Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for more information.\n​\nUpdate on Bookings \n​\nThe Company continues to experience strong consumer demand for its offerings across itineraries and brands throughout 2025 and into 2026. As a result, the Company remains at the upper range of its optimal booked position on a 12-month forward basis.\n​\nMargin Enhancement Initiative \nDuring 2024, we continued to see improvements in operating costs from our ongoing margin enhancement initiative. The Company continues to prioritize identifying and evaluating a variety of initiatives to improve its cost structure and margin profile, while preserving its brand equity and optimal guest satisfaction levels. However, global macroeconomic events have created volatility and disruptions in the past that have adversely impacted our costs and they may do so again in the future. Furthermore, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for certain portions of ship construction contracts and various exchange rates for customer deposits that have not been hedged. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in our Annual Report for additional information.\nClimate Change\nWe believe the increasing focus on climate change, including the Company’s targets for greenhouse gas reductions, and evolving regulatory requirements will materially impact our future capital expenditures and results of operations. We have set interim targets to guide us on our path to net zero and provide more details about them in our annual Sail & Sustain Report (which does not constitute a part of, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into, this Report). We expect to incur significant expenses related to these regulatory requirements and commitments, which have and will include expenses related to GHG emissions reduction initiatives, including modifications to our ships, and have and will include the purchase of emissions allowances, among other things. During 2024, we spent $47.7 million on capital expenditures for projects that are intended to reduce carbon emissions from our existing fleet. We have changed and may continue to be required to change certain operating procedures, for example slowing the speed of our ships, to meet regulatory requirements, which could adversely impact our operations. We are also evaluating the effects of global climate change related requirements, which are still evolving, including our ability to mitigate certain future expenses through initiatives to reduce GHG emissions; consequently, the full impact to the Company is not yet known. During 2024, we recognized $19.3 million of expense related to compliance with the E.U. ETS, a portion of which was collected directly from passengers through revenue. Additionally, our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in the past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. For example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns. Refer to “Impacts related to climate change may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” for further information.\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance and Income Tax Expense\nThe Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the Bermuda jurisdiction, which has a balance of $547.8 million as of December 31, 2024, primarily related to a 3-year cumulative loss. Although the Pillar 2 rules became effective in Bermuda as of January 1, 2025, the Company does not expect to have a material change in its income tax expense for 2025. \nAdditionally, the Company previously provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. jurisdiction. As discussed in Note 12 – “Income Taxes” to our financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company released $161.9 million of the valuation allowance related to its U.S. net deferred tax assets, resulting in a non-cash benefit to income tax expense. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers both the positive and negative evidence including its ability to forecast future operating results, historical tax losses and its ability to utilize deferred tax assets within the requisite carryforward periods.  After weighing all of the evidence, the Company determined that the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence and concluded that it is more likely than not that the majority of the U.S. net deferred tax assets will be realized. The positive evidence considered by the Company includes continuous improvement in its operating results and profitability, implementation of certain tax planning actions, its projections showing sufficient utilization of tax attributes within their requisite carryforward periods, the non recurring nature of the losses tied to the suspension of sailings due to COVID-19 and not having a history of expiration of tax attributes. The negative evidence considered includes that the Company has been in a three-year cumulative book loss position for the past four years. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets for which it concluded it is more likely than not they will not be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate all relevant positive and negative evidence in monitoring the realizability of its deferred tax assets and determining the appropriate timing for the recognition of any additional valuation allowance reversal. The ultimate realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon a number of uncertainties including future taxable income of the appropriate character during the requisite carryforward periods.\nExecutive Overview\nTotal revenue increased 10.9% to $9.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase in Capacity Days was primarily related to the delivery of three new ships in 2023 partially offset by increased Dry-dock days in 2024.\nExpense\nTotal cruise operating expense increased 4.0% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily related to the delivery of three new ships in 2023 partially offset by a reduction in air costs largely due to changes in itinerary mix. Total other operating expense increased 8.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily related to an increase in depreciation expense from the delivery of three new ships in 2023 and variable compensation due to strong financial performance of the business. \nInterest expense, net was $747.2 million in 2024 compared to $727.5 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 primarily reflects higher losses from extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs, which were $29.2 million in 2024 and $8.8 million in 2023. \nOther income (expense), net was income of $54.2 million in 2024 compared to expense of $40.2 million in 2023 primarily related to net gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements. \nIncome tax benefit was $137.4 million in 2024 compared to $3.0 million in 2023. The increase in the benefit was due to the reversal of the majority of our valuation allowance for the U.S. deferred tax assets in 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2024, our liquidity of approximately $2.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $190.8 million, borrowings available of $955.0 million under our Revolving Loan Facility, a €200 million commitment that can be used for future newbuild payments and a $650 million undrawn commitment less related fees. Our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. As of December 31, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of $4.8 billion. This deficit included $3.1 billion of advance ticket sales, which represents the total revenue we collected in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities. Our business model, along with our liquidity and \nundrawn export-credit backed facilities\n, allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating, investing and financing needs.\nIn February 2024, NCLC and the Commitment Parties entered into the third amended commitment letter, which became effective in March 2024. Pursuant to the third amended commitment letter, the Commitment Parties have agreed to purchase from NCLC an aggregate principal amount of $650 million of senior unsecured notes due five years after the issue date at NCLC’s option, which option is available through March 2025 and we do not expect to extend. In connection with the execution of the third amended commitment letter, NCLC agreed to repurchase all of the outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028 at a negotiated premium plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\nAdditionally, in April 2024, a €200 million commitment became available that can be used for future newbuild payments.\nIn September 2024, NCLC issued $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2030.  The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2025, the full amount of outstanding borrowings under the Breakaway one loan, Breakaway two loan, Marina newbuild loan and Riviera newbuild loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid with funds drawn from the Revolving Loan Facility. NCLC also issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2032. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to pay any related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. Concurrently, the Revolving Loan Facility was increased from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion with the maturity date extended to 2030, and the collateral of the Revolving Loan Facility and the 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029 were modified. \nRefer to Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for further details about the above financing transactions.\nBased on our liquidity estimates and our current resources, we have concluded we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the dynamic nature of the current operating environment, including any current macroeconomic events and conditions such as inflation, rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. \nWithin the next twelve months, we may pursue additional refinancings in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. We expect the holders of the 2025 Exchangeable Notes maturing in August 2025 will exchange their 2025 Exchangeable Notes for NCLH ordinary shares if not refinanced prior to maturity. There is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations. Beyond the next 12 months, we will pursue refinancings and other balance sheet optimization transactions in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. Refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors” for further details regarding risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ from our expectations.\nAt December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. If we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants, we would have to seek additional amendments to or waivers of the covenants. However, no assurances can be made that such amendments or waivers would be approved by our lenders.  Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default and/or cross acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated, which would have a material adverse impact to our operations and liquidity. \n​\nOur Moody’s long-term issuer rating is B1, our senior secured rating is Ba3 and our senior unsecured rating is B3. Our S&P Global issuer credit rating is B+, our issue-level rating on our $1.7 billion Revolving Loan Facility and $790 million 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029 is BB, our issue-level rating on our other senior secured notes is BB- and our senior unsecured rating is B+. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as has occurred in the past, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be negatively impacted. We also have capacity to incur additional indebtedness under our debt agreements and may issue additional ordinary shares from time to time, subject to our authorized number of ordinary shares. However, there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had advance ticket sales of $3.2 billion, including the long-term portion. We also have agreements with our credit card processors that, as of December 31, 2024, governed approximately $2.8 billion in advance ticket sales that had been received by the Company relating to future voyages. These agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances, including the existence of a material adverse change, excessive chargebacks and other triggering events, that the Company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral. Although the agreements vary, these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash funds directly to the card processor. Any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash collateral reserves of approximately $0.8 million with credit card processors recognized in accounts receivable, net.  The $31.5 million previously recognized in other long-term assets was returned to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2024. \n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may be required to pledge additional collateral and/or post additional cash reserves or take other actions in the future that may adversely affect our liquidity.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nIn this section, references to 2024 refer to the year ended December 31, 2024, references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion in 2024 and 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities included net income and the timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 included net income of $910.3 million and an increase in advance ticket sales of $35.7 million. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 included net income of $166.2 million, the return of $500 million cash collateral from one credit card processor and an increase in advance ticket sales of $503.7 million. \nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion in 2024, primarily related to newbuild payments and ship improvements. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion in 2023, primarily related to three new ship deliveries and newbuild payments. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.0 billion in 2024, primarily due to repayments of newbuild loans, our 2028 Secured Notes and the 3.625% senior notes due 2024 partially offset by the proceeds from newbuild loan facilities and the 2030 Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities was $346.9 million in 2023, primarily due to newbuild loans and $1.6 billion from our various note offerings, partially offset by debt repayments and a net decrease in our Revolving Loan Facility balance.\nFor the Company’s cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2024.\nFuture Capital Commitments\nFuture capital commitments consist of contracted commitments, including ship construction contracts. Anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts and growth are $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ending December 31, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. We have export-credit backed financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ending December 31, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. Anticipated other non-newbuild capital expenditures are $0.6 billion for the year ending December 31, 2025. Future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense.\nNewbuilds\nThe following chart discloses details about our newbuild program. The impacts of initiatives to improve environmental sustainability and modifications the Company plans to make to its newbuilds and/or other macroeconomic conditions and events have resulted in delays in expected ship deliveries. These and other impacts could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged. Expected delivery dates for our most recently announced newbuilds are preliminary and subject to change.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nYear\nBrand\nClass\nShip Name\nGross Tons\n(1)\nBerths\n(1)\nStatus\n2025\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nPrima Class\nNorwegian Aqua\n~156,000\n~3,550\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\n2025\nOceania Cruises\nAllura Class\nAllura\n~68,000\n~1,200\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n2026\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nPrima Class\nNorwegian Luna\n~156,000\n~3,550\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n2026\nRegent Seven Seas\nPrestige Class\nSeven Seas Prestige\n~77,000\n~850\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n2027\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNext Gen \"Methanol-Ready\n(2)\n\"\n \nPrima Class\nTo come\n~169,000\n~3,850\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n2027\nOceania Cruises\nNew Class\nTo come\n~86,000\n~1,450\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n2028\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNext Gen \"Methanol-Ready\n(2)\n\"\n \nPrima Class\nTo come\n~169,000\n~3,850\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\nExpected 2029\n(3)\n \nOceania Cruises\nNew Class\nTo come\n~86,000\n~1,450\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n2029\n(6)\nRegent Seven Seas\nPrestige Class\nTo come\n~77,000\n~850\nContract effective / financed\n(4)\n2030\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNew Class\nTo come\n~225,000\n~5,150\nContract effective / financing is being negotiated.\n2030\n(6)\nOceania Cruises\nNew Class\n—\n~86,000\n~1,450\nContract effective, but not financed.

Additional modifications will be needed to fully enable the use of green methanol.\n(3)\nDelivery for the second Oceania Cruises ship is contractually scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2028, but may be delayed to 2029, which would result in additional fees.\n(4)\nWe have obtained export-credit backed financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship as well as related financing premiums, subject to certain conditions.\n(5)\nWe have the option to cancel the effective two-ship order for Oceania Cruises. \n(6)\nDelivery dates may be delayed at the option of the builder, which would result in additional fees.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, the combined contract prices, including amendments and change orders, of the 13 ships on order for delivery (which excludes the two ships on order for Oceania Cruises, which are currently scheduled for delivery in 2030 and 2031, that we have the option to cancel) was approximately €17.5 billion, or $18.1 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2024. If the two ships on order for Oceania Cruises are cancelled, there will be incremental corresponding adjustments to the purchase price of other applicable newbuilds not to exceed €51 million. We do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur, except as noted above. However, if any such events were to occur, it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCapitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $59.9 million and $56.4 million, respectively, primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements for debt and ship construction were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2025\n    \n2026\n    \n2027\n    \n2028\n    \n2029\n    \nThereafter\n    \nTotal\nLong-term debt (1)\n​\n$\n 1,918,880\n​\n$\n 2,982,925\n​\n$\n 3,692,748\n​\n$\n 1,999,528\n​\n$\n 2,099,075\n​\n$\n 2,865,499\n​\n$\n 15,558,655\nShip construction contracts (2)\n​\n \n 2,110,819\n​\n​\n 2,135,541\n​\n​\n 2,174,827\n​\n​\n 2,011,679\n​\n​\n 938,839\n​\n​\n 7,916,565\n​\n \n 17,288,270\nTotal\n​\n$\n 4,029,699\n​\n$\n 5,118,466\n​\n$\n 5,867,575\n​\n$\n 4,011,207\n​\n$\n 3,037,914\n​\n$\n 10,782,064\n​\n$\n 32,846,925\n(1)\nIncludes principal as well as estimated interest payments with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) held constant as of December 31, 2024. Includes exchangeable notes which can be settled in NCLH ordinary shares. Excludes the impact of any future possible refinancings and undrawn export-credit backed facilities. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, we completed various financing transactions, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the Breakaway one loan, Breakaway two loan, Marina newbuild loan and Riviera newbuild loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon using funds from our Revolving Loan Facility and NCLC redeemed $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon from the net proceeds of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2032, together with cash on hand. See Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for further information. \n(2)\nShip construction contracts are for our 13 \nnon-cancelable\n newbuild ships based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we have committed undrawn export-credit backed facilities of $8.6 billion which funds approximately 80% of our ship construction contracts, with the exception of the two ships on order for Oceania Cruises that we have the option to cancel and the four additional ships on order for Norwegian Cruise Line with currently scheduled delivery from 2030 to 2036. The above presentation reflects the current delivery dates; however, certain delivery dates may be delayed at the option of the builder. \n​\nFor other operational commitments for lease and port obligations we refer you to Note 6 – “Leases” and Note 13 – “Commitments and Contingencies,” respectively, for further information.\nFunding Sources\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio and maintain certain other ratios. Approximately $15.6 billion of our assets were pledged as collateral for certain of our debt as of December 31, 2024. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nIn addition, our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries, including NCLC, to make distributions and/or pay dividends to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. NCLH is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. However, we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.\n​\nWe believe our cash on hand, borrowings available under our Revolving Loan Facility, expected future operating cash inflows and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities, will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12-month period. Refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—General” for further information regarding liquidity.\n​\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther\nCertain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business. The amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions. We refer you to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—General” for information regarding collateral provided to our credit card processors.\nAs a routine part of our business, depending on market conditions, exchange rates, pricing and our strategy for growth, we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships, acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these transactions were to occur, they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness, through cash flows from operations, or through the issuance of debt, equity or equity-related securities. \nAdditionally, we similarly consider opportunities for the sale of ships and long-term charters with purchase options. For example, we are currently contemplating a long-term charter for residences at sea with a purchase option for a nominal value at the end of the lease period. These types of agreements are being pursued as part of our ship disposal strategy for certain older vessels in our fleet.",
