Management’s Discussion and Analysis \no\nf Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest North American less-than-truckload (“LTL”) motor carriers. We provide regional, inter-regional and national LTL services through a single integrated, union-free organization. Our service offerings, which include expedited transportation, are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental United States. Through strategic alliances, we also provide LTL services throughout North America. In addition to our core LTL services, we offer a range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting. More than 98% of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting LTL shipments for our customers, whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the U.S. domestic economy.\nIn analyzing the components of our revenue, we monitor changes and trends in our LTL volumes and LTL revenue per hundredweight. While LTL revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement, it is also a commonly-used indicator for general pricing trends in the LTL industry. This yield metric is not a true measure of price, however, as it can be influenced by many other factors, such as changes in fuel surcharges, weight per shipment and length of haul. As a result, changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates. LTL revenue per hundredweight and the key factors that can impact this metric are described in more detail below:\n•\nLTL Revenue Per Hundredweight - \nOur LTL transportation services are generally priced based on weight, commodity, and distance. This measurement reflects the application of our pricing policies to the services we provide, which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives. Generally, freight is rated by a class system, which is established by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc. Light, bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense, heavy freight. Fuel surcharges, accessorial charges, revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement, and we regularly monitor the components that impact our pricing. The fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of our petroleum-based products and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the U.S. Department of Energy, which reset each week. Revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we believe including it in our revenue per hundredweight metrics results in a more accurate representation of the underlying changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments.\n•\nLTL Weight Per Shipment\n - Fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the mix of freight we receive from our customers, as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment. Generally, increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers’ products and overall increased economic activity. Changes in weight per shipment can also be influenced by shifts between LTL and other modes of transportation, such as truckload and intermodal, in response to capacity, service and pricing issues. Fluctuations in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as a decrease in weight per shipment will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.\n•\nAverage Length of Haul\n - We consider lengths of haul less than 500 miles to be regional traffic, lengths of haul between 500 miles and 1,000 miles to be inter-regional traffic, and lengths of haul in excess of 1,000 miles to be national traffic. This metric is used to analyze our tonnage and pricing trends for shipments with similar characteristics, and also allows for comparison with other transportation providers serving specific markets. By analyzing this metric, we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets. Changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.\n•\nLTL Revenue Per Shipment\n - This measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used in conjunction with the number of LTL shipments we receive to evaluate LTL revenue.\nOur primary revenue focus is to increase density, which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure. Increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity, which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor, pickup and delivery (“P&D”) stops per hour, P&D shipments per hour, platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour. In addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies, it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield, which is measured as revenue per hundredweight, on the shipments we handle. We focus on the profitability of each customer account and generally seek to obtain an appropriate yield to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. We believe the continued execution of this yield-management philosophy, continued increases in density, and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies are the key components of our ability to further improve our operating ratio and long-term profitable growth.\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight, operating supplies and expenses, which include diesel fuel, and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities. We gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio, a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue, which also allows for industry-wide comparisons with our competition.\nWe regularly upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs. Our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network, increases the productivity of our workforce, and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes.\nResults of Operations\n \nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from

financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 reflect continued softness in the domestic economy, which contributed to the decline in our revenue, net income and diluted earnings per share. We maintained our commitment to superior customer service by providing our customers with 99% on-time service and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025. This service performance supported the continued improvement in our yield. We also maintained our focus on operating efficiently and controlling discretionary spending during the quarter, although the deleveraging effect from the decrease in revenue and increases in depreciation and miscellaneous expenses led to an increase in our operating ratio. As a result, our net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 12.2% and 10.5%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the same period of 2024 and decreased 13.9% and 12.0%, respectively, for the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the same period of 2024.\nRevenue\nOur revenue decreased $63.7 million, or 4.3%, and $239.9 million, or 5.4%, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2024, primarily due to a decrease in volumes. LTL tonnage per day decreased 9.0% and 8.2% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2024, due to decreases in both LTL shipments per day and LTL weight per shipment, which reflects continued softness in the domestic economic environment.\nThe decreases in our volumes were partially offset by increases in our LTL revenue per hundredweight of 4.7% and 3.4% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2024. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, also increased 4.7% in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the same period of 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, the increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight includes the impact of lower fuel surcharges that resulted from a decline in the average price of diesel fuel from the comparable period. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 4.7% in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the same period of 2024. We believe the increase in our LTL revenue-per-hundredweight metrics in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, as compared to the same periods of 2024, was driven by the ongoing execution of our long-term yield management strategy. Our consistent, cost-based approach to pricing focuses on offsetting our cost inflation while also supporting additional investments into our business to expand capacity and enhance our technology.\n \nOctober 2025 Update\nRevenue per day decreased 6.8% in October 2025 as compared to the same month last year. LTL tons per day decreased 11.7%, due to a 9.8% decrease in LTL shipments per day and a 2.2% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.6% as compared to the same month last year. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 5.3% as compared to the same month last year.\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating Costs and Other Expenses\nSalaries, wages and benefits decreased $18.2 million, or 2.7%, in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024, due to a $17.2 million, or 3.5%, decrease in salaries and wages and a $1.0 million, or 0.5%, decrease in employee benefit costs. Salaries, wages and benefits decreased $40.2 million, or 2.0%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the same period of 2024, due to a $50.7 million, or 3.4%, decrease in salaries and wages that was partially offset by a $10.5 million, or 1.9%, increase in employee benefit costs.\nThe decrease in salaries and wages in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, as compared to the same periods of 2024, was primarily due to the decrease of 6.2% and 5.2%, respectively, in our average number of active full-time employees as we balanced our workforce with current shipping trends. Salaries and wages also decreased as a result of lower performance-based bonus compensation, the impacts of which were partially offset by the annual wage increase provided to our employees at the beginning of both September 2025 and 2024. Our productive labor costs, which include wages for drivers, platform employees, and fleet technicians, increased as a percent of revenue to 24.1% and 24.4%, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, as compared to 24.0% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as a result of the decrease in network density. Despite this decrease in network density that generally results from the decline in volumes, our team continued to deliver superior service to our customers while also focusing on operating efficiencies. Our other salaries and wages as a percent of revenue increased to 9.7% and 9.8%, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, as compared to 9.4% and 9.5%, respectively, in the same periods of 2024.\nOur costs attributable to employee benefits were negatively impacted by higher costs associated with our group health and dental plans during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 due to increases in the average costs per claim as compared to the same periods of 2024. Our employee benefit costs were also impacted by decreases in retirement benefit plan costs directly linked to our net income as well as the reduction in our average number of active full-time employees. As a result, employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages increased to 39.7% in the third quarter of 2025 from 38.6% in the comparable period of 2024 and increased to 39.2% in the first nine months of 2025 from 37.1% in the comparable period of 2024.\nOperating supplies and expenses decreased $12.0 million, or 7.7%, and $53.1 million, or 10.9%, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2024, due to decreases in our costs for diesel fuel used in our vehicles as well as lower maintenance and repair costs. The cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption. Our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel increased 2.3% in the third quarter of 2025 and decreased 6.7% in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the same periods of 2024. We do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments; therefore, our costs are subject to market price fluctuations. Our gallons consumed decreased 8.6% and 7.7% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2024, primarily due to a decrease in miles driven. Additionally, our other operating supplies and expenses decreased between the periods compared primarily due to lower maintenance and repair costs for our fleet.\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased $5.6 million, or 6.4%, and $16.3 million, or 6.4%, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2024, primarily due to the increases in depreciation costs of the assets acquired as part of our 2024 and 2025 capital expenditure programs. We believe depreciation costs will continue to increase in future periods based on our 2025 capital expenditure plan. While our investments in real estate, equipment, and technology can increase our costs in the short-term, we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued long-term growth and strategic initiatives.\nMiscellaneous expenses, net increased $6.6 million, or 201.7%, and $11.6 million, or 64.8%, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2024, primarily due to changes in gains and losses on the disposal of property and equipment.\nOur effective tax rate was 24.8% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, as compared to 23.4% and 24.5%, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and, to a lesser extent, certain other non-taxable or non-deductible items.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA summary of our cash flows is presented below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n108,676\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n433,799\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flows provided by (used in):\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,059,840\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,258,224\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(358,243\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(584,249\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(763,681\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,033,611\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(62,084\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(359,636\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46,592\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n74,163\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 was due to a decrease in net income and changes in certain working capital accounts, primarily related to receivables.\nThe change in our cash flows used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the reduction in our 2025 capital expenditure plan as compared to 2024. Changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below under “Capital Expenditures.”\nThe change in our cash flows used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower cash utilized for repurchases of our common stock in the first nine months of 2025, as we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement in the second quarter of 2024, and an increase in net borrowings under our credit agreement in the second and third quarters of 2025. Our repurchases of common stock and financing arrangements are more fully described below under “Stock Repurchase Program” and “Financing Agreements,” respectively.\nWe have four primary sources of available liquidity: cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our third amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as administrative agent for the lenders, dated March 22, 2023 (as subsequently amended, the “Credit Agreement”), and our Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with PGIM, Inc. (“Prudential”) and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential (as subsequently amended, the “Note Agreement”). The Credit Agreement and the Note Agreement are described in more detail below under “Financing Agreements.” We believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity, if needed.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 and the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand and structures\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n150,514\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n373,416\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n291,070\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTractors\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n140,006\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n218,682\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n203,417\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailers\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32,043\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n103,919\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n181,534\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,592\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,037\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44,358\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther equipment and assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35,103\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47,264\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36,930\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Proceeds from sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(10,915\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(20,124\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(48,637\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n358,343\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n751,194\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n708,672\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur capital expenditures vary based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities necessary to support our plan for long-term growth, our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle, and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth. Expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand. We historically spend 10% to 15% of our revenue on capital expenditures each year, and we generally expect to continue to maintain a level of capital expenditures that we believe supports our long-term plan for market share growth. There could be years, however, where our annual capital expenditure plan is above or below this range as we balance the size of our service center network and operating fleet with anticipated growth. We expect our capital expenditures to remain below this range in both 2025 and 2026 as we continue to utilize available capacity within our existing network for growth.\nWe currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately $450 million for the year ending December 31, 2025. Approximately $210 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities, construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities, subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects; approximately $190 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers; and approximately $50 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets. We expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under the Credit Agreement or Note Agreement. We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months and in the longer term.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn July 28, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock (the “2021 Repurchase Program”). The 2021 Repurchase Program began after completion of our prior repurchase program in January 2022 and was completed in May 2024. On July 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $3.0 billion of our outstanding common stock (the “2023 Repurchase Program”). The 2023 Repurchase Program, which does not have an expiration date, began after the completion of the 2021 Repurchase Program in May 2024.\n \nUnder our repurchase programs, we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions. Shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.\n \nOn May 28, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with a third-party financial institution. The ASR Agreement was accounted for as a settled treasury stock purchase and a forward stock purchase contract. The par value of the initial shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock, with the excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The forward stock purchase contract was accounted for as a contract indexed to our own stock and is classified within capital in excess of par value on our Condensed Balance Sheets. The ASR Agreement was settled with the final number of shares received based on the daily volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. Under the ASR Agreement, we paid the third-party financial institution $200.0 million and received an initial delivery of 923,201 shares of our common stock for $160.0 million, representing approximately 80% of the total value of shares to be received by us under the ASR Agreement, and the remaining balance of $40.0 million was settled in November 2024. We repurchased a total of 1,056,213 shares for $200.0 million under the ASR Agreement.\nAt September 30, 2025, we had $1.67 billion remaining authorized under the 2023 Repurchase Program.\nDividends to Shareholders\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.28 per share for each quarter of 2025 and declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share for each quarter of 2024.\nAlthough we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future, the declaration and amount of any future dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and is restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our Credit Agreement and Note Agreement. We anticipate that any future quarterly cash dividends will be funded through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents, and, if needed, borrowings under our Credit Agreement or Note Agreement.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFinancing Agreements\nNote Agreement\nThe Note Agreement, which is uncommitted and subject to Prudential’s sole discretion, provides for the issuance of senior promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to $350.0 million through March 22, 2026. On May 4, 2020, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior promissory notes (the “Series B Notes”). Borrowing availability under the Note Agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of the existing Series B Notes, and all other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement.\n \nThe Series B Notes bear interest at 3.10% per annum and mature on May 4, 2027, unless prepaid. The first three principal payments of $20.0 million each were paid in May of 2023, 2024 and 2025. The remaining $40.0 million will be paid in two equal annual installments of $20.0 million in May 2026 and May 2027. The Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under the Credit Agreement or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement.\nCredit Agreement\nThe Credit Agreement, which matures in March 2028, initially provided for a five-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a $150.0 million accordion feature. On May 23, 2025, we exercised the accordion feature and entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the total borrowing capacity from existing lenders by $150.0 million to an aggregate of $400.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows for up to $100.0 million to be utilized for letters of credit against the line of credit, which was unchanged by the amendment.\nAt our option, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the Term SOFR Adjustment, as defined in the Credit Agreement, equal to 0.100%, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.375%; or (ii) a Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.000% to 0.375%. The applicable margin for each of the foregoing options is dependent upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio. Letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for SOFR loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. Commitment fees ranging from 0.090% to 0.175% (based upon our consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization ratio) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the Credit Agreement.\nFor periods covered under the Credit Agreement, the applicable margin on SOFR loans and letter of credit fees were 1.000% and commitment fees were 0.090%.\nThe amounts outstanding and available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement are presented below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Agreement limit\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n400,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n250,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Agreement borrowings\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(45,000\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding letters of credit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(37,464\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(37,702\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Credit Agreement availability\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n317,536\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n212,298\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGeneral Debt Provisions\nThe Credit Agreement and Note Agreement contain customary covenants, including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement and Note Agreement also include a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments, including dividends and payments for share repurchases, unless, among other conditions, no defaults or events of default are ongoing (or would be caused by such restricted payment). We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended September 30, 2025.\nWe do not anticipate financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future, and we believe the combination of our existing Credit Agreement and Note Agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long-term capital needs.\nThe interest rate is fixed on the Series B Notes. Therefore, short-term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our Credit Agreement. We do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing our condensed financial statements, we applied the same critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.\nSeasonality\nOur tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry, although other factors, such as macroeconomic changes, could cause variation in these trends. Our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months. Harsh winter weather, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other natural disasters can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses. We believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business.\n \nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on, among other things: the disposal, emission and discharge of hazardous waste, hazardous materials, or other materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles; fuel storage tanks; transportation of certain materials; and the discharge or retention of storm water. Under specific environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with clean-up of accidents involving our vehicles. We do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, competitive position or capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025. However, future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business.\nForward-Looking Information\nForward-looking statements appear in this report, including, but not limited to, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in other written and oral statements made by or on behalf of us.
