  "item1": "Item 1. Business\n section and \nOverview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook \nsection within MD&A of our 2024 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development Initiatives and Other Recent Developments\n––We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. For a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 27, 2025, the filing date of our 2024 Form 10-K, see \nNote 2\n in our 2024 Form 10-K. See \nNote 2\n \nand the following for significant recent business development activities and other recent developments:\nAgreement with the U.S. Government\n–– \nIn September 2025, we announced preliminary agreements with the Trump Administration in which we voluntarily agreed to implement measures designed to make certain drug prices for U.S. patients more comparable to those in other developed countries. We will also participate in a direct purchasing platform, TrumpRx.gov, that will allow American patients to purchase certain medicines from us at significant discounts to current retail prices, where the large majority of the Company’s primary care treatments and some select specialty brands will be offered at savings that \n36\nwill range as high as 85% and on average 50%. The agreements also provide a three-year grace period during which time our products under a Section 232 investigation will not face tariffs, provided the Company further invests in manufacturing in the U.S. Pfizer is now in the process of negotiating definitive agreements to implement these arrangements.\nProposed Acquisition of Metsera\n–– In September 2025, we and Metsera announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Metsera, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company accelerating the next generation of medicines for obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, for $47.50 in cash per Metsera share at closing, representing an enterprise value of approximately $4.9 billion. Additionally, the agreement includes a non-transferable contingent value right entitling holders to potential additional payments of up to $22.50 per share in cash tied to the achievement of three specific milestones: $5 per share following the Phase 3 clinical trial start of Metsera’s injectable GLP-1 receptor antagonist MET-097i+ amylin analog MET-233i combination, $7 per share following FDA approval of Metsera’s monthly MET-097i monotherapy and $10.50 per share following FDA approval of Metsera’s monthly MET-097i+MET-233i combination. We expect to finance the transaction through a combination of available cash and new debt. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval by Metsera’s shareholders.\nIn October 2025, we announced the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with respect to Pfizer’s pending acquisition of Metsera. As such, all required regulatory approvals in respect of Pfizer’s acquisition of Metsera have been obtained.\nIn October and November 2025, we announced that Pfizer has filed lawsuits against Metsera, Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo Nordisk) and several related parties and individuals in the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. District Court of the District of Delaware for claims relating to a competing proposal to acquire Metsera made by Novo Nordisk on October 25, including claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference in contract arising from Metsera’s breach of its obligations under the merger agreement between Pfizer and Metsera, as well as various antitrust-related claims. Pfizer is requesting the Delaware Court of Chancery issue a temporary restraining order to block Metsera from terminating the merger agreement and seeks all appropriate remedies to ensure the terms of the merger agreement are fully enforced. \nOur Third Quarter 2025 and First Nine Months of 2025 Performance\nTotal Revenues\n––\nTotal revenues\n decreased $1.0 billion, or 6%, in the third quarter of 2025 to $16.7 billion from $17.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting an operational decrease of $1.3 billion, or 7%, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $203 million, or 1%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines from Paxlovid and Comirnaty largely due to lower infection rates impacting Paxlovid demand as well as a narrower vaccine recommendation for COVID-19 in the U.S. that reduced the eligible population for Comirnaty, partially offset primarily by increases in Eliquis, the Vyndaqel family and Nurtec ODT/Vydura.\nTotal revenues\n decreased $842 million, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2025 to $45.0 billion from $45.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024, reflecting an operational decrease of $811 million, or 2%, as well as a de minimis impact of foreign exchange of $31 million. The operational decrease was primarily driven by a decline from Paxlovid, partially offset by increases from the Vyndaqel family, Eliquis, Padcev and Lorbrena.\nSee the \nTotal Revenues by Geography\n and \nTotal Revenues––Selected Product Discussion\n sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues anticipated in the fall and winter seasons, as well as additional changes in recommendation for vaccination, and Paxlovid revenues trend with infection rates. See also \nThe Global Economic Environment––COVID-19\n section below for information about our COVID-19 products. For information regarding the primary indications or class as well as revenue of certain products, see \nNote 13C\n.\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Provision/\n(\nBenefit\n)\n for Taxes on Income\n––The decrease in \nIncome from continuing operations before provision/\n(\nbenefit\n)\n for taxes on income\n of $1.4 billion to $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2025 from $4.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, was primarily due to an increase in \nAcquired in-process research and development expenses\n and lower revenues, partially offset by a decrease in\n Cost of sales.\nThe increase in \nIncome from continuing operations before provision/\n(\nbenefit\n)\n for taxes on income\n of $1.1 billion, to $9.2 billion in the first nine months of 2025 from $8.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024, was primarily due to decreases in \nCost of sales\n, \nSelling, informational and administrative expenses, Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs \nand \nResearch and development expenses,\n partially offset by an increase in\n Acquired in-process research and development expenses \nand lower revenues\n.\nSee\n \nthe\n \nAnalysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n section within MD&A and \nNotes\n \n3\n and \n4\n. For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the \nProvision/\n(\nBenefit\n)\n for Taxes on Income\n section within MD&A and \nNote 5\n.\n37\nOur Operating Environment\n––We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the \nItem 1. Business––Government Regulation and Price Constraints \nand",

  "item2": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\n OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in \nItem 1. Financial Statements\n \nin this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and Strategy\n––Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. Our 2025 key priorities are to:\n1.\n Improve R&D productivity with sharpened focus\n2. Expand margins and maximize operational efficiency\n3, Achieve commercial excellence in our key categories\n4. Optimize capital allocation.\nOne way we believe we will be more efficient, effective and able to execute on these strategic priorities is through digital enablement, including automation and AI.\nSegments\n––We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of three operating segments: Biopharma, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See \nNote 13A\n.\nRestructuring Programs\nRealigning Our Cost Base Program\n•\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, we identified additional productivity opportunities to further reduce costs primarily in SI&A, driven in large part by enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes.\n•\nIn connection with our efforts to simplify the structure and sharpen the focus of our R&D organization, in the first quarter of 2025, we expanded this program after having identified additional opportunities to drive improvements in productivity and operational efficiencies through enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes.\nManufacturing Optimization Program\n––In the second quarter of 2024, we announced that we launched a multi-year, multi-phased program to reduce our costs of goods sold, which is expected to include primarily operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancements.\nSee \nNote 3\n \nfor the anticipated and actual costs of these programs. For a description of anticipated savings related to these programs, see the \nCosts and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\n \nsection within MD&A\n.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the \nItem 1.

These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the \nItem 1. Business––Government Regulation and Price Constraints \nand\n Item 1A. Risk Factors \nsections,\n \nand the \nOverview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook\n––\nOur Operating Environment \nsection of the MD&A\n \nof our 2024 Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights\n––The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and judgments, and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent-based or regulatory exclusivity expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries in 2025 and anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent-based or regulatory exclusivity expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience these expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.\nFor additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, including U.S., major Europe and Japan basic product patent expiration years, see the \nItem 1. Business––Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights \nsection of our 2024 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation involving certain of our products, see \nNote 12A1\n.\nRegulatory Environment/Pricing and Access––Government and Other Payor Group Pressures\n––Governments globally, as well as payors in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, legislative or regulatory pricing reforms, drug formularies (including tiering and utilization management tools), cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes, clawbacks and volume-based procurement. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. \nIn the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by the U.S. government and states on regulating drug pricing and access to medicine, including but not limited to, international reference pricing, including Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) drug pricing. The drug pricing provisions of the IRA are being implemented over the next several years. In August 2023, CMS published the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which requires manufacturers of select drugs to engage in a process with the federal government to set new Medicare prices which would go into effect in 2026. Eliquis was among the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. In August 2024, the government released the new Medicare price for Eliquis, which, effective January 1, 2026, will be required to be offered to all Medicare beneficiaries and to covered entities participating in the 340B Program that dispense Eliquis to a Medicare beneficiary if that maximum fair price is lower than the discounted price such entities are offered under the 340B Program ceiling price calculation. The Eliquis Medicare price is factored into our long-term financial planning, in accordance with our standard financial reporting and forecasting protocols. On January 17, 2025, CMS announced the selection of another 15 drugs from Medicare Part D for the maximum fair price, with prices to be set and effective on January 1, 2027. Ibrance and Xtandi were included in the list of 15 drugs selected. Another 15 drugs from Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D will be selected by February 1, 2026, for the maximum price to be set and in effect by January 1, 2028. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, lead to lower revenues prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. The IRA also made significant changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design (IRA Medicare Part D Redesign), which took effect beginning in 2025 and are impacting our revenues. In 2025, we expect a favorable impact from the $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap and new Prescription Payment Plan, more than offset by an expected unfavorable impact from the sunsetting of the Coverage Gap Discount Program and the addition of new manufacturer discounts in the initial and catastrophic coverage phases, which we anticipate will have a net unfavorable impact to revenue in 2025 of approximately $1 billion, year-over-year. We expect a higher impact in the beginning of 2025, moderating through the remainder of the year, when compared to 2024. We expect these changes will more acutely impact our higher-priced medicines as they are expected to reach catastrophic coverage earlier in the year. In addition, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or the 340B Program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B Program, could have a material impact on our business. See the \nItem 1. Business\n––\nPricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations \nand ––\nGovernment Regulation and Price Constraints\n and the \nItem 1A. Risk Factors––Pricing and Reimbursement \nsections, and the \nOverview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our Operating Environment\n section of the MD&A of our 2024 Form 10-K\n.\nPolicy/Regulatory Environment\n––New and potential policy, regulatory or other changes from the U.S. Presidential administration, Congress and states, including, among others, increased or new regulatory requirements, including heightened requirements for licensure, changes, delays or failure to receive recommendations, reimbursement and regulatory approvals and \n38\ncoverage for our vaccines and medicines could have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flows, liquidity and financial guidance.\nProduct Supply\n––We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made disasters. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines and we are actively engaging with regulatory authorities on this topic. If nitrosamines are detected in products, this may lead to submission of comprehensive data packages to regulatory authorities to support discussions on the relevant intake limit for the product and potential impact on patient supply, and, in some instances, may lead to market action for such products. For example, in 2021, Pfizer recalled Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above acceptable intake limits communicated by various regulatory authorities. Following issuance of updated guidance on acceptable intake limits for N-nitroso-varenicline by regulatory authorities, Chantix has returned to market in the U.S. and in certain international markets.\nWe have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first nine months of 2025 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. We do not anticipate the availability of raw materials to have a significant impact on our operations in 2025, but are monitoring potential supply chain disruptions as a result of ongoing geopolitical and trade negotiations, which could, among other things, impact costs. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product manufacturing, see the \nItem 1A. Risk Factors––Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks\n section of our 2024 Form 10-K.\nVoluntary Withdrawal of Oxbryta\n––\nSee the \nProduct Developments\n section within MD&A.\nThe Global Economic Environment\n––In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. See the \nItem 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations\n section of our 2024 Form 10-K, as well as the \nOverview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook\n––\nThe Global Economic Environment \nsection of the MD&A of our 2024 Form 10-K.\nGlobal Trade Environment\n––Issued or future executive orders or other new or changes in laws, regulations or policy regarding tariffs or other trade policy, could have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flows, liquidity and financial guidance. The actual impact of new tariffs on our business would be subject to a number of factors including, but not limited to, restrictions on trade, the effective date and duration of such tariffs, countries included in the scope of tariffs, changes to amounts of tariffs, and potential retaliatory tariffs or other retaliatory actions imposed by other countries. Strategies intended to help mitigate the potential impacts on our business in the short-term have been implemented as well as those outlined in our preliminary agreements with the Trump administration as discussed above. We are continuing to evaluate opportunities and developing plans which are intended to help mitigate the potential long-term impact of tariffs on our business and operations. See the \nItem 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations\n section of our 2024 Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19\n––In response to COVID-19, we developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant investments in breakthrough science. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. See the \nProduct Developments\n section within MD&A.\nIn 2025, for Comirnaty, we expect market share in commercial markets and revenue phasing similar to 2024, primarily concentrated in the second-half of the year. However, we expect lower vaccination rates in certain markets due to changes in vaccination recommendations. For example, in September 2025, the ACIP voted to recommend “shared clinical decision making” for all FDA- approved COVID-19 vaccines consistent with the licensed ages applicable to each of the vaccines. The expected impact has been incorporated in our 2025 financial guidance. See the \nItem 1A. Risk Factors—U.S. Healthcare Regulation \nsection of our 2024 Form 10-K for a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could impact revenue from our portfolio of vaccines.\nIn 2025, for Paxlovid, we generated most revenue through commercial channels. We have seen lower demand for Paxlovid as a result of lower infection rates. We continue to expect a higher proportion of revenue to be delivered in the second-half of the year and revenues may fluctuate based on the timing, duration and severity of COVID-19 cases. The expected impact of the lower than anticipated demand has been incorporated in our 2025 financial guidance.\nFor additional information on risks associated with our COVID-19 products, as well as COVID-19 intellectual property disputes, see the \nOverview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook\n––\nThe Global Economic Environment\n––\nCOVID-19 \nsection of the MD&A of our 2024 Form 10-K, \nItem 1A.

These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these product revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.\nThe following presents information about product revenue deductions:\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(MILLIONS)\nSeptember 28,\n2025\nSeptember 29,\n2024\nSeptember 28,\n2025\nSeptember 29,\n2024\nMedicare rebates\n(a)\n$\n1,188 \n$\n1,801 \n$\n3,359 \n$\n3,278 \nMedicaid and related state program rebates\n522 \n720 \n1,309 \n1,846 \nPerformance-based contract rebates\n1,948 \n1,836 \n5,222 \n4,884 \nChargebacks\n4,125 \n3,805 \n10,268 \n9,467 \nSales allowances\n1,851 \n1,569 \n5,406 \n4,654 \nSales returns and cash discounts\n(b)\n517 \n1,123 \n1,156 \n1,474 \nTotal\n$\n10,151 \n$\n10,855 \n$\n26,720 \n$\n25,603 \n(a)\nThe decrease in Medicare rebates in the third quarter of 2025 is driven by lower Paxlovid revenues following transition from the U.S. government agreement, partially offset by the impact of higher manufacturer discounts as a result of IRA Medicare Part D Redesign. The increase in Medicare rebates in the first nine months of 2025 is primarily driven by the impact of higher manufacturer discounts as a result of IRA Medicare Part D Redesign, partially offset by lower Paxlovid revenues. See the \nOverview of Our Performance, Operating E\nnvironment, Strategy and Outlook\n section within MD&A. \n(b)\nThe decrease in Sales returns and cash discounts in the first nine months of 2025 is primarily driven by lower sales returns provision for Comirnaty, partially offset by a $771 million favorable final adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2024 to the estimated non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nProduct revenue deductions are primarily a function of product sales volume, mix of products sold, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates.\nFor information on our accruals for product revenue deductions, including the balance sheet classification of these accruals, see \nNote 1C\n.\nTotal Revenues––Selected Product

and\n•\nlower spending of $85 million in the third quarter and $370 million in the first nine months in corporate enabling functions,\npartially offset by:\n•\nincreases of $260 million in the third quarter and $235 million in the first nine months due to a favorable adjustment of U.S. healthcare reform fees recorded in the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty.\n44\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses \ndecreased $52 million in the third quarter and $556 million in the first nine months of 2025 primarily driven by a net decrease in spending of $90 million in the third quarter and $590 million in the first nine months due to pipeline focus and optimization including the expansion of our digital capabilities, as well as lower compensation-related expenses.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses\n increased $1.4 billion in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2025 primarily driven by a $1.35 billion charge related to an in-licensing agreement with 3SBio. \nRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nRealigning Our Cost Base Program\n––\nThis program is expected to deliver total net cost savings of approximately $5.7 billion through 2027. The total net cost savings are composed of: (i) net cost savings of $4.5 billion expected to be achieved by the end of 2025, most of which was achieved by year-end 2024, and (ii) our additional anticipated net cost savings of $1.2 billion, primarily in SI&A, expected to be achieved by the end of 2027. In addition, we expect cost savings of approximately $500 million from the expansion of this program in the first quarter of 2025 related to our R&D re-organization to be fully realized by the end of 2026, with the savings expected to be reinvested in R&D programs by the end of 2026.\nManufacturing Optimization Program\n––\nThe first phase of this multi phased program is on track to deliver approximately $1.5 billion in net cost savings by the end of 2027, contributing savings in the third quarter of 2025.\nCertain qualifying costs for these programs in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the \nNon-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income\n section within MD&A.\nFor a description of our programs, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see \nNote 3\n.\n \nThe program savings discussed above may be rounded and represent approximations. In addition to these programs, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity expiries as well as the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products. Long-term improvement in gross margin will remain a key focus for the Company over the next few years.\nSeagen acquisition\n––\nIn connection with our acquisition of Seagen, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of annual cost synergies, to be achieved by the end of 2026. The one-time costs to generate these synergies are expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, incurred primarily from 2023 through 2025.\nOther (Income)/Deductions—Net\nThe unfavorable period-over-period change of $275 million in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by (i) an intangible asset impairment charge in the third quarter of 2025, (ii) lower net gains on equity securities, (iii) the non-recurrence of equity method income in the third quarter of 2024 from our previous investment in Haleon and (iv) higher charges for certain legal matters, partially offset by (v) a non-recurrence of a charge in the third quarter of 2024 related to the expected sale of one of our facilities resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program and (vi) lower net interest expense. \nThe unfavorable period-over-period change of $180 million for the first nine months of 2025 was primarily driven by (i) higher charges for certain legal matters, (ii) higher intangible asset impairments, (iii) net losses on equity securities in 2025 versus net gains on equity securities in 2024, (iv) the non-recurrence of a realized gain on the partial sale of our previous investment in Haleon recorded in the first quarter of 2024 and (v) the non-recurrence of equity method income from our previous investment in Haleon, partially offset by (vi) lower net interest expense and (vii) a non-recurrence of a charge in the third quarter of 2024 related to the expected sale of one of our facilities resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program.

The EU approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate the OECD provisions into their respective domestic laws, and countries outside the EU have also been enacting the provisions into their domestic law. The provisions are generally effective for Pfizer since 2024, though significant details and guidance around the provisions are still pending. Income tax expense could be impacted as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, and such impact could be material to our results of operations. We continue to monitor pending OECD guidance and legislation enactment and implementation by individual countries. \nOn July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was enacted into law in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant tax provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and modifications to the U.S. international tax framework. Among the favorable business provisions are the permanent expensing for domestic R&D costs, permanent bonus depreciation and full expensing of qualified production property. The legislation includes various effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025.\n \nWe expect further guidance may be issued by the U.S. government with respect to certain OBBBA tax provisions. \nThe OBBBA also renamed the provision for taxes on foreign earnings from Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) to Net Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) Tested Income (NCTI) and established a 12.6% tax rate on such foreign earnings effective in the fiscal year 2026 (down from 13.125% in 2026 before the enactment of the OBBBA). We have elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI, now NCTI, in future years. As a result of the enactment of the OBBBA, in the third quarter of 2025, we remeasured our deferred tax balances related to NCTI for the changes in the tax rate and recorded a one-time tax benefit that was not material to our results of operations.\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS\nA comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published as of November 4, 2025 and is available at \nwww.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline\n.

Pfizer also discontinued all active voxelotor clinical trials and expanded access programs worldwide. Pfizer’s decision was based on the totality of clinical data available at that time that indicated the overall benefit of Oxbryta no longer outweighed the risk in the approved sickle cell patient population. The data suggested an imbalance in vaso-occlusive crises and fatal events, which required further assessment. Pfizer notified regulatory authorities about these findings and its decision to voluntarily withdraw Oxbryta from the market and discontinue distribution and clinical studies while further reviewing the available data and investigating the findings. In July 2024, the EMA initiated a referral procedure under Article 20 of EC Regulation No 726/2004 for Oxbryta to review the product’s benefits and risks. In October 2024, the EC suspended the Oxbryta marketing authorization while the EMA’s review of data was ongoing. In addition, the FDA initiated an evaluation of newly identified safety signals. The FDA also placed the Oxbryta investigational new drug application on clinical hold following Pfizer’s market withdrawal. \nFollowing comprehensive review and analysis of the final data, Pfizer submitted updated data and risk management proposals to the EMA, FDA and other regulators. In the EU, the EMA’s referral procedure concluded in October 2025, with the EMA adopting a negative opinion on benefit-risk for Oxbryta for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD, recommending that the marketing authorization for the product remain suspended. In the U.S., Pfizer’s engagement with the FDA is ongoing. Pfizer is carefully assessing the positions of both EMA and FDA.\n48\nIn December 2024, the FDA issued a partial clinical hold for osivelotor, which prohibited Pfizer from enrolling new participants into osivelotor clinical studies. The FDA recently concluded that initiation of osivelotor studies and enrollment may proceed outside of sub-Saharan Africa and for participants who have not relocated from sub-Saharan Africa. \nIn August 2025, Pfizer announced results from the Phase 3 THRIVE-131 study evaluating inclacumab, an investigational P-selectin inhibitor, in patients 16 years of age and older with SCD. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of significant reduction in the rate of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in participants receiving inclacumab versus placebo every 12 weeks over 48 weeks. Inclacumab was generally well tolerated in THRIVE-131. Inclacumab has been removed from the table above.\nFor additional information about our R&D organization, see \nNote 13\n and the \nItem 1. Business\n—\nResearch and Development\n section of our 2024 Form 10-K. For additional information regarding certain collaboration arrangements see the \nItem 1. Business\n—\nCollaboration and Co-Promotion Agreements \nsection of our\n \n2024 Form 10-K.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME\nAdjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:\nMeasure\nDefinition\nRelevance of Metrics to Our Business Performance\nAdjusted income\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n(a) \nbefore the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items\n•\nProvides investors useful information to:\n◦\nevaluate the normal recurring operational activities, and their components, on a comparable year-over-year basis\n◦\nassist in modeling expected future performance on a normalized basis\n•\nProvides investors insight into the way we manage our budgeting and forecasting, how we evaluate and manage our recurring operations and how we reward and compensate our senior management\n(b)\nAdjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, Adjusted research and development expenses and Adjusted other (income)/deductions\n––\nnet\nCost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses\n and\n Other \n(\nincome\n)\n/deductions––net\n(a)\n, each before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are components of the Adjusted income measure\nAdjusted diluted EPS\nEPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders––diluted\n(a)\n before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items\n(a)\nMost directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(b)\nThe short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part versus three budgeted financial metrics, as well as performance against certain of our non-financial pipeline metrics, and may be further modified by our Compensation Committee’s assessment of other factors. One of the three financial metrics, beginning with the 2025 performance year, is Adjusted income (as defined for annual incentive compensation purposes), which accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Any expenses for acquired IPR&D are included in our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. Additionally, beginning with the 2025 performance year, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted diluted EPS, which is derived from Adjusted income.  \nAdjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of\n Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n, components of \nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n and \nEPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders—diluted\n, respectively.\nWe also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.\n49\nAdjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n—Adjusted income excludes all amortization of intangible assets.\nAcquisition-Related Items\n—Adjusted income excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are composed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include purchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. \nDiscontinued Operations\n—Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\nCertain Significant Items\n—Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to generic or biosimilar entry or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters generally related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business.

We continue to believe that with our ongoing operating cash flows, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreement, and available lines of credit, we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future. For information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources, as well as our operating cash flows, see our \nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n, \nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n, \nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Equity\n, and the \nAnalysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n section within MD&A. For information on our money market funds, available-for sale-debt securities and long-term debt, see \nNote 7\n.\nFor information about our diverse sources of funds, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual and other obligations, global economic conditions and market risk, see the \nAnalysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk\n section\n \nwithin MD&A of our 2024 Form 10-K. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see \nNote 12B\n.\nCredit Ratings\n––The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s.\nAs of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, the following ratings have been assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:\nNAME OF RATING AGENCY\nPfizer Short-Term Rating\nPfizer Long-Term Rating\nOutlook/Watch\nMoody’s\nP-1\nA2\nStable Outlook\nS&P\nA-1\nA\nStable Outlook\n52\nThese ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organizations. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nDebt Capacity––Lines of Credit\n––As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we had access to a $7.0 billion committed U.S. revolving credit facility maturing in October 2030, which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our global commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facility, our lenders have provided us an additional $242 million in lines of credit, which expire within one year. Essentially all lines of credit were unused as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q.\nCapital Allocation Framework\n––Our capital allocation framework is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value and is based on three core pillars: maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in the business and making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. Over time, we expect to continue to de-lever in a prudent manner in order to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy.\nDividends\n––In October 2025, our BOD declared a dividend of $0.43 per share, payable on December 1, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 7, 2025.\nCommon Stock Purchases\n—As of September 28, 2025, our remaining share-purchase authorization was $3.3 billion, with no repurchases in the first nine months of 2025.

Early adoption is permitted.\nThis new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the notes to our financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued final guidance which requires \ndisaggregated disclosures of certain categories of expenses that are included in expense line items on the face of the income statemen\nt. The disclosures are required on an annual and interim basis.
