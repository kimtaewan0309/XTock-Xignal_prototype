  "item1": "Item 1.       BUSINESS\nLabcorp® Holdings Inc. (Labcorp or the Company) is a global leader of innovative and comprehensive laboratory services that provides vital information to help doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and patients make clear and confident decisions. By leveraging its unparalleled diagnostics and drug development capabilities, the Company provides insights and accelerates innovations to improve health and improve lives. The Company’s nearly 70,000 employees serve clients in approximately 100 countries, provided support for more than 75% of the new drugs and therapeutic products approved in 2024 by the FDA, and performed more than 700 million tests annually for patients around the world.\nOn April 25, 2024, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LCAH) announced plans to implement a new public holding company structure, with Labcorp Holdings Inc. as the holding company. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed the holding company reorganization (Reorganization) and became the successor issuer to LCAH. Labcorp Holdings Inc. has no independent assets or operations and its sole ownership interest is in LCAH.\nThe Company is organized under two segments, consisting of Diagnostics Laboratories (Dx), which includes routine testing and specialty/esoteric testing, and Biopharma Laboratory Services (BLS), consisting of Early Development Research Laboratories (ED) and Central Laboratory Services. The Company\n’\ns strength in science, technology, and innovation, as well as its global scale, enable it to play a leading role in advancing healthcare across the globe.\nThe significant reach, breadth, and advancement of the Company’s offerings have resulted in Base Business revenue growth of 4.9% from 2023 through 2024 and 7.4% versus 2019 compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Base Business includes the Company’s business operations except for COVID-19 PCR testing (COVID-19 Testing).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company generated revenues of $13,008.9 million, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.84, and had a total operating cash flow provided by continuing operations of $1,585.8 million.\nThe Company believes that science, technology, and innovation drive its continued success, differentiate the Company, and are foundational to its future. They are critical to the Company’s ability to carry out its mission to improve health and improve lives. \nSpin-off of Fortrea Holdings Inc.\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company completed the previously announced separation (Spin-off) of its former clinical development and commercialization services (CDCS) business, Fortrea Holdings Inc. (Fortrea), through the Company’s pro-rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding shares of Fortrea common stock to holders of record of Labcorp common stock (Common Stock). Each holder of record of Common Stock received one share of Fortrea common stock for every share of Common Stock. \nUpon closing of the Spin-off, Fortrea made a cash distribution to the Company of approximately $1,600.0 million. In 2023, these proceeds were mainly used to repurchase approximately $1,000.0 million in the aggregate of Common Stock pursuant to accelerated share repurchase agreements and paying down $300.0 million of debt that matured in 2023. The remaining funds were used in 2024 to support continued programs to return value to shareholders, through cash dividends and/or share repurchases.\nAs a result of the Spin-off, all current and historical operating results of Fortrea are presented as Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Company has recast its BLS segment results to exclude the historical results of the CDCS business for all periods presented. \nEnterprise Strategy\n \nThrough leadership in science, technology and innovation, the Company provides vital information and services to help its customers make clear and confident health decisions and helps millions of people improve health and improve lives.\nThe Company is expanding its role in the rapidly evolving healthcare market by strengthening its positions across its portfolio of capabilities, growing strategic opportunities that drive new business, and differentiating its unique offerings, capabilities, and financial performance. The Company is focused on two near-term strategic opportunities for growth across both Dx and BLS:\n1.\nBe the Partner of Choice for Health Systems and Local and Regional Laboratories\nThe Company expects industry consolidation to continue, as hospitals and health systems focus on investing in core patient care services. The depth and the breadth of opportunity and the quality of the pipeline is robust, and the Company is optimistic \n7\nIndex\nabout continued expansion. The Company seeks partnerships that meet financial criteria, including being accretive in the first year, returning each transaction’s cost of capital within three years, and providing a clear path to improve margins.\nThe Company signed or completed 10 collaboration transactions with health systems and local and regional laboratories in 2024. The Company believes it is an attractive partner for hospitals and health systems for multiple reasons, including its: \n•\ninnovative offerings in high growth specialty areas;\n•\nindustry-leading test portfolio and national presence;\n•\nunique data and analytics capabilities; and\n•\nability to integrate a hospital’s laboratory services seamlessly.\n2.\nLead in the Development, Licensing, and Scaling of Specialty Testing\nThe Company is focused on four primary specialty testing areas: oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease, and neurology, which the Company believes represent significant growth areas. The development of specialty tests and companion diagnostics (CDx) are attractive to health systems partners and biopharma as they continue to develop more products in specialty areas and cell and gene therapy. The Company has demonstrated its ability to provide comprehensive portfolios in these four areas, which comprise more than half of clinical trials conducted in its Central Laboratory Services business. \nLonger-term, the Company is focused on three enterprise-wide strategic priorities to drive growth:\n1.\nEstablish leadership and partnership capabilities in cell and gene therapy\nCell and gene therapy is a growing focus of biopharma pipelines, with approximately 2,000 clinical trials being conducted globally and representing approximately 20% of all biopharma drug pipelines. The Company expects the cell and gene therapy market to grow at a substantially higher rate than other types of therapies over the next five years. As cell and gene therapies expand, the Company has an opportunity to leverage its strong drug development capabilities, scientific expertise, and pharma relationships to become a development lab of choice. Longer-term as these therapies develop, the Company believes it can harness its diagnostic assets to support biopharma in commercializing cell and gene therapies and scaling these therapies through its hospital and health system business over time.\n2.\nExpand Consumer-centric Capabilities\nConsumerism trends, such as greater choice, convenience, and transparency, continue to have a growing influence across the healthcare landscape and present new opportunities for growth. Through its core customer groups, the Company has approximately 175 million patient encounters per year and has invested in modern capabilities to digitize and improve the patient journey across patient service centers. Through the Labcorp OnDemand™ channel, the Company has also demonstrated its ability to connect with consumers directly and is now offering 75 health and wellness tests through Labcorp OnDemand. Across its core businesses, the Company has an opportunity to make strategic investments to continue to enhance the customer experience through its patient portal, patient service center network, and other consumer-focused initiatives, and to capitalize on select direct revenue streams that require elevated consumer capabilities. The Company’s scaled operations, trusted brand, scientific leadership, and broad customer base are key differentiators that will support its efforts to expand over time to meet the evolving needs of its customer groups.\n3.\nExpand Global Reach, Including Through Companion Diagnostics\nInternational expansion of specialized diagnostics remains a key opportunity for future growth as the Company continues to add to its pipeline of specialty diagnostics. The Company is already a key partner to biopharma in CDx. \nAs its pip\neline of specialty diagnostics grows, the Company will seek to leverage its scientific leadership in new markets through a differentiated set of capabilities, including:\n•\na global central laboratory footprint;\n•\ninnovative science and technology;\n•\na comprehensive and competitive testing portfolio; and\n•\ndeep customer relationships in diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services.\nAs CDx continues to become more important for serving customers across the enterprise, the Company has a unique set of capabilities to be an end-to-end partner to biopharma and will continue to expand these capabilities to fuel further targeted growth internationally.\nCapital Allocation\nThe Company believes it has a strong track record of deploying capital to investments that enhance the Company’s business and return capital to shareholders. \n8\nIndex\nDuring 2024, the Company invested $839.0 million in strategic business acquisitions. The acquisitions have enhanced the Company’s service offerings, expanded its customer and revenue mix, and strengthened and broadened the scope of its geographic presence. The Company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities that leverage the Company’s core competencies, complement existing scientific and technological capabilities, increase the Company’s presence in key geographic, therapeutic and strategic areas, and meet or exceed the Company’s financial criteria. \nDuring 2024, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of Common Stock at an average price of $219.57 per share for a total cost of $250.1 million and paid dividends of $243.1 million. At the end of 2024, the Company had outstanding authorization from its Board of Directors (Board) to purchase up to $1,280.4 million maximum value of Common Stock.\nDuring 2024, capital expenditures were $489.9 million, or 3.8% of the Company’s revenues. The Company expects this level of spending to remain consistent in 2025, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the Company’s core businesses, facility expansion and updates, projects related to its LaunchPad initiative, and further acquisition integration initiatives. \nThe Company will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic deployment of capital in light of market conditions.\nSeasonality and External Factors\nThe Company experiences seasonality across its business. For example, testing volume generally declines during the year-end holiday period and other major holidays and can also decline due to inclement weather or natural disasters. Testing volumes can also be impacted by changes in the global economy, exchange rate fluctuations, political and regulatory changes, the progress of ongoing studies and the startup of new studies, as well as the level of expenditures made by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries in research and design (R&D). Declines in testing volume reduce revenues, operating margins, and cash flows.\nIn 2024, approximately 13.7% of the Company’s revenues were billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with the Swiss franc, British pound, Canadian dollar, and the euro representing the largest components of its currency exposure. \nGiven the seasonality and changing economic factors impacting the business, comparison of the results for successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year.\nCompany Reporting \nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.labcorp.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The 7.0% increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, was primarily due to organic revenue of 3.9%, acquisitions, net of divestitures of 2.8%, and favorable foreign currency translation of 0.2%. The 3.9% increase in organic revenue was due to a 4.9% increase in the Company’s organic Base Business, partially offset by an 1.0% decrease in COVID-19 Testing. \nIn Millions, Except Per Share Data\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nRevenues\n$\n13,008.9 \n$\n12,161.6 \nGross profit\n$\n3,624.4 \n$\n3,364.9 \nOperating income\n$\n1,086.7 \n$\n725.6 \nNet earnings attributable to Labcorp Holdings Inc.\n$\n746.0 \n$\n418.0 \nCash flows provided by continuing operating activities\n$\n1,585.8 \n$\n1,202.3 \nBasic earnings per common share from continuing operations\n$\n8.89 \n$\n4.35 \nDiluted earnings per common share from continuing operations\n$\n8.84 \n$\n4.33 \nThe Company reports its business in two segments, Dx and BLS. In 2024, Dx and BLS contributed 78% and 22%, respectively, of revenues to the Company, and in 2023 contributed 77% and 23%, respectively. Nearly all of Dx’s revenues are generated in the U.S., with a smaller portion in Canada and a relatively small amount in the rest of the world. BLS’s revenues are nearly evenly split between the U.S. and the rest of the world, with approximately 41% derived from the U.S. and approximately 59% from other countries. Although this allocation of revenues provides some protection from economic shifts in any one country, it is still heavily tilted towards the U.S. As a result, to further diversify its operations, the Company may explore select business opportunities outside the U.S. The Company’s revenues by segment payers/customer groups and by geography for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nNorth America\nEurope\nOther\nTotal\nNorth America\nEurope\nOther\nTotal\nPayer/Customer\nDx\n   Clients\n24 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n24 \n%\n24 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n24 \n%\n   Patients\n10 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n10 \n%\n9 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n9 \n%\n   Medicare and Medicaid\n8 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n8 \n%\n8 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n8 \n%\n   Third party\n36 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n36 \n%\n36 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n36 \n%\nTotal Dx revenues by payer\n78 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n78 \n%\n77 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n77 \n%\nBLS\n   Pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies\n9 \n%\n9 \n%\n4 \n%\n22 \n%\n10 \n%\n9 \n%\n4 \n%\n23 \n%\nTotal revenues\n87 \n%\n9 \n%\n4 \n%\n100 \n%\n87 \n%\n9 \n%\n4 \n%\n100 \n%\nDiagnostics Laboratories Segment\nDuring 2024, the Dx segment generated $10,144.3 million in revenues and $1,606.3 million in segment operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 15.8%. \nIn Millions\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nRevenues\n$\n10,144.3 \n$\n9,415.1 \nDx segment operating income\n$\n1,606.3 \n$\n1,591.3 \nDx offers a comprehensive menu of frequently requested core testing and specialty testing through an integrated network of primary and specialty laboratories across the U.S. and Canada. This network is supported by a sophisticated information technology system, with more than 80,000 electronic interfaces to deliver test results, nimble and efficient logistics, and local labs offering rapid response testing. \nDx also provides patient access points that are strategically and conveniently located throughout the U.S., including more than 2,200 patient service centers (PSCs) and more than 6,800 in-office phlebotomists located in customer offices and facilities. \n10\nIndex\nAlthough testing for healthcare purposes and customers who provide healthcare services represents the most significant portion of the clinical laboratory industry, clinical laboratories also perform testing for other purposes and customers, including employment and occupational testing, deoxyribonucleic acid testing to determine parentage and to assist in immigration eligibility determinations, environmental testing, wellness testing, toxicology testing, pain management testing, and medical drug monitoring. Dx offers an expansive test menu that includes a wide range of clinical, anatomic pathology, genetic and genomic tests, and regularly adds new tests and improves the methodology of existing tests to enhance patient care. Dx also offers more than 75 consumer-initiated wellness tests available online through its Labcorp OnDemand platform. \nAs part of an ongoing commitment to be an efficient and high-value provider of laboratory services, Dx implemented and has maintained a comprehensive business process improvement initiative known as LaunchPad. The initiative was designed to reengineer the Company’s systems and processes to create a sustainable and more efficient business model, and to improve the experience of all stakeholders.\nThe Dx business can be categorized into the following components:\nService\nKey Features\nTesting Operations and Productivity\n•\nNetwork of PSCs offering specimen collection services\n•\nComprehensive, nimble supply chain for transferring specimens across the entire life cycle of a patient sample\n•\nOne- to two- day turnaround time for most test results, with the vast majority of results delivered electronically to healthcare providers and to patients who have a Labcorp Patient™ account\n•\nRigorous standard of quality - 25 regional/specialty labs hold International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15189 certification, five labs hold ISO 13485 certification, and two labs hold both\nTesting and Related Services\n•\nStandard Testing Services - \nfrequently-ordered tests used in regular patient care include blood chemistry analyses, urinalyses, blood cell counts, thyroid tests, PAP tests, hemoglobin A1C, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tests for sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, human immunodeficiency (HIV), and hepatitis C (HCV)), vitamin D, microbiology cultures and procedures, and alcohol and other substance abuse tests\n•\nSpecialty Testing Services -\n industry leader in gene-based and esoteric testing; advanced tests that target specific diseases and use new technologies; services include anatomic pathology/oncology, cardiovascular disease, coagulation, diagnostic genetics, endocrinology, infectious disease, women’s health, pharmacogenetics, parentage and donor testing, occupational testing services, medical drug monitoring services, chronic disease programs, and kidney stone prevention\n•\nDx offers a range of health and wellness services to employers and MCOs, including health fairs, on-site and at-home testing, vaccinations and health screenings \nDevelopment of New Tests\n•\nNearly 100 new tests \nlaunched in \n2024\n•\nActive diagnostics and therapeutics research division: approximately 750 studies, articles, and presentations produced in \n2024\n•\nContinuous investing, internally and externally, in new testing technologies and advanced testing capabilities\nTechnology-Enabled Services and Support\nA range of services and support using proprietary technologies to improve the customer and patient experience and provide convenient access to data and analytics, including:\n•\nMore th\nan 6.7 million en\nhanced clinical decision support (CDS) reports delivered to physicians and health systems\n•\nOnline and mobile applications improving the patient experience by allowing patients to learn about the Company’s offerings, schedule PSC visits, check-in upon PSC arrival, complete documentation, access tests and test results, and manage their accounts\n•\nOnline applications for providers, MCOs and accountable care organizations (ACOs) to obtain test results and population and health management data\nEffect of U.S. Market Changes on the Clinical Laboratory Business\nThe delivery of, and reimbursement for, healthcare continues to change in the U.S., impacting all stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory business. Medicare (which principally serves patients who are 65 and older), Medicaid (which principally serves low-income patients), and insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization, and delivery of healthcare services. Measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular have resulted in reduced prices, added costs, increased coverage denials and claims edits, and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory \n11\nIndex\nindustry by imposing new, increasingly complex regulatory and administrative requirements. The government also has continued to adjust the Medicare and Medicaid fee schedules at the national and local level, and the Company believes that pressure to reduce government reimbursement will continue.\nFees for most laboratory services reimbursed by Medicare are established in the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) and fees for other testing reimbursed by Medicare, primarily related to pathology, are covered by the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). During 2024, approximately 8.8% of Dx’s revenue was reimbursed under the CLFS (8.8% in 2023), and approximately 0.4% was reimbursed under the PFS (0.4% in 2023). Dx has experienced governmental reimbursement reductions as a direct result of several Congressional acts and regulatory initiatives, including those designed to control healthcare expenses reimbursed by government programs through a combination of reductions to fee schedules, incentives to physicians to participate in alternative payment models such as risk-sharing, and new methods to establish and adjust fees.\nThe most significant of these developments was the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). Beginning in 2018, under PAMA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) set the CLFS using the weighted median of reported private payer prices paid to certain laboratories that receive a majority of their Medicare revenue from the CLFS and PFS and that bill Medicare under their own National Provider Identifier (NPI). Applicable labs, including Dx, were required to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to CMS during the first quarter of 2017. CMS used that private market data to calculate weighted median prices for each test (based on applicable current procedural technology (CPT) codes) to represent the new CLFS rates beginning in 2018, subject to certain phase-in limits. For 2018 through 2020, a test price could not be reduced by more than 10.0% per year. PAMA resulted in a net reduction in reimbursement revenue of approximately $245.0 million between 2018-2020 from all payers affected by the CLFS.\nSince 2021, the implementation of additional PAMA reporting and reimbursement changes have been delayed each year by legislators. Pursuant to PAMA as amended, for 2026 through 2028, a CLFS test price cannot be reduced by more than 15.0% per year (excluding non-PAMA reimbursement changes). CLFS rates for 2029 and subsequent periods will not be subject to phase-in limits. The phase-in of rates for Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (CDLTs) established in 2018 will resume in 2026. New CLFS rates will be established in 2027 based on data from 2019 to be reported in 2026. New CLFS rates will be established in 2030 based on data from 2028 to be reported in 2029. CLFS rates for Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests will be updated annually. Unless implementation of PAMA is further delayed or changed, additional reductions in reimbursements of $100.0 million are expected for 2026 from all payers affected by the CLFS.\nThe American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) filed a federal civil action in 2017 challenging the legal basis for the data collection methodology CMS used to derive the data from which the median prices were calculated. On July 15, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of ACLA on the merits, finding that CMS harmed laboratories by collecting data in an arbitrary and capricious manner, but refused to grant relief due to PAMA’s statutory bar on judicial review of establishment of the rates.\nSince the initial data collection, CMS has revised its PAMA regulations to increase the number of hospital outreach labs that will be required to report private market data in future collections. Reports by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) on PAMA implementation have identified certain instances of actual or potential increased Medicare expenditures under PAMA, as well as potential alternative methodologies for data collection under PAMA, which could result in further efforts to amend PAMA by Congress.\nACLA has continued to work with Congress on potential legislative reform of PAMA, which if adopted could reduce the negative impact of PAMA as currently implemented by CMS. Under the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act, MedPAC was required to conduct a study and make recommendations to Congress on ways to improve data collection, reporting, and rate setting under PAMA to achieve, in a less burdensome manner, CLFS rates that accurately and fairly reflect private market rates. MedPAC’s June 2021 report to Congress included an analysis of potential statistical sampling methodologies that could accomplish that objective, and ACLA incorporated the concept in PAMA reform proposals to Congress. On June 22, 2022, the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act (SALSA), was introduced in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives to provide for permanent reform of PAMA incorporating many of ACLA’s proposals. SALSA was re-introduced in the US. Senate on March 28, 2023, and in the U.S. House of Representatives on March 29, 2023. ACLA is considering amendments and alternatives to SALSA that remain under evaluation. The Company supports the ongoing efforts to prevent or lessen the negative impact of the changes to the CLFS pursuant to PAMA, and the full impact of those efforts, but what the long-term effect will be on the CLFS rates is not yet known.\nFurther healthcare reform could occur in 2025, including changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare and Medicaid reform, as well as administrative requirements that may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services in ways that are currently unpredictable.\n12\nIndex\nIn addition, market-based changes have affected and will continue to affect the clinical laboratory business. Reimbursement from commercial payers for diagnostic testing may shift away from traditional, fee-for-service models to alternatives, including value-based, bundled pay-for-performance, and other risk-sharing payment models. The growth of the managed care sector and consolidation of MCOs present various challenges and opportunities to Dx and other clinical laboratories. Dx’s ability to attract and retain MCO customers has become even more important as the impact of various healthcare reform initiatives continues, including expanded health insurance exchanges and ACOs.\nThe Company serves many MCOs. These organizations have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of their products. Some MCOs contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of rates. Other MCOs adopt broader networks with generally uniform fee structures for participating clinical laboratories. In some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories, while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different and are typically higher. MCOs may also offer managed Medicare or managed Medicaid plans. In addition, some MCOs use capitation rates to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. Under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the clinical laboratory receives a per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of laboratory tests or based upon the proportionate share earned by the clinical laboratory from a capitation pool. When the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. Under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2024, capitated contracts with MCOs accounted for approximately $366.0 million, or 3.6%, of Dx’s revenues.\nIn addition to reductions in test reimbursement, the Company also anticipates potential declines in test volumes as a result of increased controls over the utilization of laboratory services by Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payers, particularly MCOs. MCOs are implementing, directly or through third parties, various types of laboratory benefit management programs, which may include laboratory networks, utilization management tools (such as prior authorization and/or prior notification), and claims edits, which impact coverage and reimbursement of clinical laboratory tests. Some of these programs address clinical laboratory testing broadly, while others are focused on certain types of testing, including molecular, genetic, and toxicology testing. In addition, continued movement by patients into consumer-driven health plans may have an impact on the utilization of laboratory testing. \nHelping to balance the overall negative market changes regarding reimbursement discussed above, the Company believes that the volume of clinical laboratory testing is positively influenced by several factors, including an increase in the number and types of tests that are readily available (due to advances in technology and increased cost efficiencies) for the diagnosis of disease, and the general aging of the U.S. population. Periodic infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus also have the potential to generate additional testing volume in the future and enhance stakeholders’ appreciation for the value of laboratory testing in combating future potential outbreaks. Dx believes that its enhanced and growing menu of tests, focus on high-potential clinical areas, leading position with CDx, broad geographic footprint, and operating efficiency make it well positioned for growth due to a number of market factors, primarily related to a continued drive to improve outcomes and reduce costs across the healthcare system, including but not limited to greater price transparency required under “surprise billing” laws and regulations requiring disclosure of hospital charges. \nBiopharma Laboratory Services Segment\nDuring 2024, the BLS segment generated $2,922.6 million in revenues and $458.9 million in segment operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 15.7%.\nIn Millions\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nRevenues\n$\n2,922.6 \n$\n2,774.2 \nBLS segment operating income\n$\n458.9 \n$\n396.3 \nBLS provides drug development, medical device and CDx development solutions from early-stage research to clinical development, along with support for crop protection and chemical testing, through its ED and Central Laboratory Services businesses.

Engaging the collective expertise and passion of its employees across the globe is vital to achieving the Company’s mission, which permeates its performance-driven, collaborative, inclusive, customer-centered, and inquisitive culture.\nWorkforce Demographics\nThe Company’s global talent is core to its ability to innovate and meet a wide range of patient and customer needs. The Company’s employees are globally dispersed, with 89% in the U.S. and Canada, 5% in Asia, and 6% in Europe. Of the Company’s global workforce, 87% of employees are full time, and 13% are part time. Approximately 71% of the Company’s employees globally are women. Of the U.S.-based employees, approximately 52% of the team are people of color. About 2.5% of the Company’s global workforce is employed under a collective bargaining agreement. Depending on business demand and the availability of talent, the Company supplements up to 8% of its workforce with contingent workers. \nIn 2024, the Company made investments in its talent to support retention and enable the Company’s growth. For the fourth consecutive year, hiring outpaced voluntary attrition, both globally and in the U.S.\nTalent Initiatives\nThe Company’s talent initiatives support the development of inclusive leadership and culture, enhancing the team member experience, and supporting community engagement and patient focus. Highlights for 2024 include:\n•\nLaunch of a listening strategy, including measuring employee experience, inclusion, and well-being;\n•\nSupporting our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are created and led by employee volunteers and open to all employees. ERGs are important resources to foster cross-connections, encourage belonging, support career development, and champion employee voices. The Company now has nine unique ERGs – with 118 local chapters across eight countries (United States, Belgium, China, Switzerland, Germany, India, Singapore, and United Kingdom) \n14\nIndex\nwith 7,900 participating employees, representing a growth of 43% participation compared to the year prior. Each ERG has executive sponsorship from senior leadership;\n•\nRecognition of locally relevant celebrations of cultural events reflecting the breadth of different cultures, constituencies, and observances throughout the year;\n•\nContinued deployment of anti-harassment training to employees around the world;\n•\nContinued support of mentoring programs, including a formal mentoring initiative;\n•\nContinued opportunities for greater engagement between employees and management, including quarterly global town halls, which are held virtually and are open to all employees, interactions with front-line employees on visits to the Company’s facilities, and in-person town halls with employees across business units and functions;\n•\nHarmonization of the U.S. paid holiday policy to now recognize six company-designated holidays and one floating holiday – providing a more consistent and inclusive experience for eligible U.S. non-exempt employees. By offering the flexibility of a floating holiday, the Company aims to better accommodate the unique needs, beliefs, and backgrounds of our workforce; and\n•\nReceived several awards, such as Silver Military Friendly Award, Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, and Forbes’ Best Places to Work for Diversity.\nRewards\nThe Company operates in a complex, global, and dynamic healthcare industry and believes that its compensation and benefits programs are comprehensive and flexible to attract and retain the caliber of talent needed for the sustained growth and success of the business.\nThe Company regularly monitors market activity and employee movement within and outside of the healthcare industry to maintain competitiveness. In 2024, the Company awarded $93 million in annual merit increases to recognize its talent and foster pay competitiveness in the market.\nEmployee Well-being\nThe Company believes that its investments in compensation and employee well-being are crucial to maintaining comprehensive positioning and a productive, engaged workforce. The Company fulfills its commitment to employee well-being by investing in a variety of holistic tools and resources to support its employees’ physical, emotional, and financial well-being. \nIn early 2024, the Company re-launched its wellness program making it more inclusive of both domestic and international employees. This new program, called “Best You”, translates easily into the different languages of our international employees and can be tailored to local needs by “Best You Champions” that are present in most countries where the Company has in-office employees. The Company is integrating Best You into the fabric of our company worldwide. The Company has outreach programs to support its ERGs and other groups in providing wellness support to members.\nIn support of Best You, the Company continues to offer zero-cost telehealth and implemented free virtual Primary care visits for medical, dermatological, and behavioral treatment as part of its medical plans in the U.S., employer matching 401(k) contributions, financial wellness workshops, and custom stress management strategies for teams around the world.\nThe Company also understands the importance of providing mental health resources to support employees and their families. In 2024, the Company implemented a global employee assistance program (EAP) solution to support employee mental health across the globe. In addition, a suite of People Leader Mental Health Trainings was expanded to further support employees. Best You wellbeing breaks were leveraged by leaders for their teams across the globe, with sessions such as guided meditations and stretch breaks. In partnership with EAP providers, the Company recognized World Kindness Day in November 2024 with events and education throughout the whole month, including videos from our executive leadership team educating and supporting a culture of Kindness, which also helps build an inclusive culture committed to the Company’s mission and strategy.  \nAdditional efforts in support of employee wellbeing include:\n•\nReducing the cost of monthly medical insurance contributions by $240 per year for more than 17,500 employees in the U.S. earning less than $50,000 per year who participate in Company medical plans;\n•\nOffering free annual wellness screenings for U.S. employees and covered spouses/domestic partners focusing on identifying metabolic conditions that can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and diabetes. Nearly 28,000 U.S. employees and their covered spouses completed the no-cost screening and earned an annual medical plan contribution discount of up to $4,560;  \n15\nIndex\n•\nProviding up to $1,000 in health reimbursement arrangement and health savings account contributions, available to approximately 31,000 employees and their spouses or domestic partners to encourage health and wellness education and activities;\n•\nReimbursing up to $300 in fitness-related expenses for more than 13,000 employees across the U.S. and Canada;\n•\nProviding free ColoFit\nTM\n kits to over 5,000 employees to enhance colon cancer awareness and screenings;\n•\nOffering Weight Watchers at no cost to employees and adding Weight Watchers Clinic access to support weight health with more than 7,400 employees actively engaged; and\n•\nExpanding $0 MDLIVE services to include Virtual Primary Care alongside Urgent Care, Behavioral Health, and Dermatology for U.S. medical plan participants.\nThe Company’s No Charge Laboratory Testing program enables eligible U.S. employees and their covered dependents to offset any outstanding balance for most lab work sent to a Company facility or patient service center, following insurance claim processing. Additionally, the Company offers global initiatives to encourage sustainable transportation through programs such as discounted transportation vouchers, reduced-cost bicycle leases, and mileage reimbursement for bicycle commuters, with benefits varying by country.\nTo enable its employees to establish ownership in the Company, the Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that permits substantially all U.S., Canada, and United Kingdom employees to purchase Common Stock at a 15% discount. \nDevelopment and Training\nAs an organization that pursues answers to the world’s most critical healthcare questions, the Company supports its employees with a work environment that emphasizes continuous learning and development. Through these learning and development opportunities, the Company encourages learning, growth, and innovation to deliver better patient care and new solutions for its customers. The Company provides professional skills training and role specific training, along with formal and informal mentoring and job rotations. The Company onboards and develops new hires through extensive training provided by a dedicated team of technical skill trainers with different departments and functions.\n2024 Training Milestones:\n•\nProvided more than 13,000 courses, many of which are available virtually within the global learning management system;\n•\nCompleted over 1.1 million hours of training, primarily consisting of regulatory and technical training;\n•\nOffered mentoring programs that nearly 2,800 employees participated in as either mentors or mentees; and\n•\nCompleted more than 15,000 hours of professional development.\nAs a leader in science, the Company has almost 12,000 science-based jobs and leverages several internal scientific forums to help scientists at all levels of experience continuously learn, innovate, and advance their skills in the healthcare industry. Through these forums, those in scientific roles are staying current in their fields of study, sharing their knowledge with others, and helping to expand the skills and experience of their colleagues.\nThe Company’s ongoing investment in the development of its people stems from a continuing commitment to build a highly talented team. In addition to traditional tuition reimbursement, over the past four years Labcorp Education Advantage has actively supported employees in their pursuit of higher education by covering tuition costs for healthcare or life science degree programs that contribute to their career advancement within the Company. To date, more than 1,800 employees have benefited from this initiative, while also avoiding student loan debt.\nTo assist with creating a pipeline of future medical lab scientists to support its customers, the Company established the Labcorp School of Medical Laboratory Sciences. The National Accrediting Agency of Clinical Laboratory Sciences approved the Company’s application, which allowed the Company to host an inaugural class of students as part of its accreditation process. In September 2024, five students across three U.S. sites joined the inaugural class. The Company is providing training to students tuition free to support them in obtaining certification for technical careers that are in high demand. Students have the option to work in the Company’s laboratories outside of school hours.\nHealth and Safety\nThe nature of the Company’s business requires employees to work directly with patients and animals. This includes the handling, processing, and testing of human or animal specimens on a daily basis. As the health and safety of employees is a primary concern, the Company has established numerous employee health and safety protocols, including engineering and administrative controls, policies, procedures, processes, and training to minimize the potential for, and the severity of, work-related injuries and illnesses.\n16\nIndex\nIn 2024, the Company reduced its work-related injury rate per 100 employees by 14.2% and its work-related lost work injury rate per 100 employees by 24.7%. The Company completed a Corporate EHS Audit on 11 significant laboratory facilities, allowing it to assess locations against common expectations and performance criteria. The Company also completed nearly 120,000 safety training sessions covering topics that included bloodborne pathogen, chemical safety, and employee health and safety general awareness. \nCommunity Engagement\nLabcorp fosters a culture of giving back beyond the scope of day-to-day tasks. The Access for All initiative leads community engagement efforts of Labcorp and its employees to make a positive impact across the globe. The Labcorp Charitable Foundation extends Labcorp’s commitment to Access for All by investing in programs in communities across the globe in the areas of health, education and community.\nIn 2024, colleagues continued to support the Company’s global Employee Giving Campaign. Through the campaign, colleagues are able to collectively support the following charities: American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, American Red Cross, United Way, National Urban League, Project HOPE, and new in 2024 to expand Labcorp’s global reach, the International Committee of the Red Cross. These agencies align with Labcorp’s mission to improve health and improve lives by leading the way in healthcare research, providing services to benefit the underserved, and supporting those affected by disaster. Additionally, The Labcorp Charitable Foundation offers a match opportunity for contributions made through the campaign.\nLabcorp, its employees and The Labcorp Charitable Foundation are committed to expanding access to healthcare, education, housing, and community support through strategic philanthropy and volunteerism. The Company’s initiatives address social determinants of health while fostering science, technology, engineering, and math education, particularly in underserved communities. By investing in the well-being of those Labcorp serves, the Company helps build stronger communities, remove barriers to healthcare and create opportunities for success.\nThroughout the year, whether through financial grants or employee volunteerism, the Company is focused on providing Access for All. Labcorp’s employees assisted in building homes, collecting food, serving meals, and providing essential items to help in underserved communities. The Company financially supported patient assistance programs and community education programs to help improve health of the patients it serves.\nDynacare, a Labcorp company committed to Canada’s health and wellness, continued their efforts to raise awareness about type 2 diabetes and provide testing to those that need it most. During Diabetes Awareness Month, Dynacare partnered with Diabetes Canada to organize five mobile clinics in communities that are most at risk of developing diabetes.\nContinuing efforts to make a positive impact, colleagues from across the globe teamed up to serve their communities through the Healthy Communities Contest. This contest ran for three months and encouraged Labcorp employees to unite in acts of kindness to advance Access for All through volunteerism. In return, three teams were selected for their chosen charity to receive a grant from The Labcorp Charitable Foundation.\nThe Labcorp Charitable Foundation, a private, charitable 501(c)(3) organization established and supported by the Company, invested in more than 200 programs in 2024 that align with the Company’s strategic mission to improve health and improve lives by supporting efforts that increase access to health services, particularly for underserved populations across the globe. Through a partnership with Project HOPE, the Labcorp Charitable Foundation supported a rural health program in China to increase access to pediatric and cancer care services.\n The Labcorp Charitable Foundation remained committed to providing relief to communities in need following disaster through support of the American Red Cross Disaster Responder Program. This ongoing commitment supports enables the American Red Cross to provide individual emergency assistance, disaster preparedness, food, shelter and relief items, health and emotional support, and community recovery leading up to and following a disaster or crisis. The Foundation also matched employee donations made to qualified health and humanitarian organizations.\nAdditionally, in response to the devastation caused by storms such as Hurricanes Helene and Milton along the U.S. East Coast, Labcorp employees mobilized to raise funds, organize donation drives and directly assist impacted communities.\nIn 2024, Labcorp continued to empower its employees to serve as agents of positive change, aligning their personal values with the Company's mission of enhancing health, through two signature employee engagement programs. Double Your Donation offers a 1:1 match by The Labcorp Charitable Foundation for Labcorp employee donations to qualifying non-profit organizations. Dollars for Doers encourages Labcorp employees to support their communities through volunteer service by offering a monetary donation from The Labcorp Charitable Foundation in recognition of their volunteer or board service to eligible non-profit organizations.\n17\nIndex\nCustomers \nThe Company provides its services to a broad range of customers across Dx and BLS. The primary customer groups serviced by the Company include:\n•\nPayers - Health Plans\n. The Company serves many health plans, including MCOs, employer plans, and other health insurance providers, each of which operates on a national, regional, or local basis. In certain locations, health plans may delegate to independent physician associations (IPAs) or other alternative delivery systems (e.g., ACOs) the ability to negotiate for services on behalf of certain members. \n•\nPharmaceutical, Biotechnology, Medical Device, and Diagnostics Companies and Contract Research Organizations (CROs)\n. The Company provides services to hundreds of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, and diagnostics companies and CROs ranging from the world’s largest multi-nationals to emerging, small and mid-market companies. \n•\nPhysicians, Large Provider Organizations, and Other Healthcare Providers\n. Physicians and other healthcare providers who are authorized to order clinical laboratory testing for their patients are a primary source of requests for Dx’s testing services. These physicians and other providers may practice in a range of settings, including small medical practices, community-based clinics, and large, multidisciplinary organizations.\n•\nHospitals and Health Systems\n. The Company provides hospitals and health systems with services ranging from core and specialty testing to supply chain and technical support services, and the opportunity to be a research partner for participation in studies and clinical trials with BLS. In some cases, a hospital’s on-site laboratory may be operated or managed by an outside contractor or independent laboratory, including the Company. \n•\nOther Customers\n. The Company serves a broad range of other customers, including, but not limited to, governmental agencies, employers, patients and consumers, crop protection and chemical companies, academic institutions, independent clinical laboratories, and retailers. \nSales, Marketing, and Customer Service\nThe Company offers its services through a sales force focused on serving the specific needs of customers in different market segments. The Company’s sales force is responsible for both new sales and for customer retention and relationship building.\nFor Dx, these market segments have different representatives focused on each segment in order to better understand and respond to the unique needs of each segment. These include clinical areas, such as primary care, oncology, women’s health, autoimmune diseases, neurology, infectious diseases, endocrinology, gastroenterology, rheumatology and other specialties; payers, such as ACOs, MCOs, and employers, and customers, such as physicians and physician organizations, and hospitals and health systems. The BLS global sales organization provides customer coverage across the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries for services including lead optimization, preclinical safety assessment, analytical services, clinical trial enablement through data insights, central laboratory services, biomarker testing, CDx, and technology solutions. As part of the Company’s ongoing strategic priority to maximize the value of its unique leadership in both diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services, sales representatives from each business segment work together on outreach to potential customers of both businesses, including hospitals and health systems that may purchase testing and participate in clinical trials, or pharmaceutical, biotechnology, or medical device companies whose studies may benefit from use of Dx’s specialty testing, companion diagnostics, and network of PSCs.\nMarket Opportunity\nDx\nThe Company believes that in 2024\n, the U.S. clinical laboratory testing industry generated reven\nues of more than $80 billion. The clinical laboratory industry consists primarily of three types of providers: hospital-based laboratories, physician-office laboratories, and independent clinical and anatomical pathology laboratories, such as those operated by Dx.\nThe clinical laboratory business is int\nensely competitive, and the Company believes that both competition and consolidation in the clinical laboratory business will continue. CMS has estimated that, as of March 2024 (the most recent data available as of the filing of this report), there were nearly 320,000 clinical laboratories of all types, including approximately 9,200 hospital-based laboratories, just under 123,000 physician-office laboratories, and approximately 8,500 independent clinical and anatomic pathology laboratories in the U.S. Dx co\nmpetes with all of those laboratories. In addition, an increasing number of health syst\nem laboratories have been expanding their operations and business, resulting in greater competition for testing from physicians within those systems and from unaffiliated physicians in the health system laboratories’ service areas. \n18\nIndex\nDx believes that the selection of a laboratory is primarily based on the following factors, all of which the Company believes Dx competes favorably in:\n•\nbrand strength and reputation;\n•\nleadership in science, technology, and innovation; \n•\npatient satisfaction levels; \n•\nnational scale, and local presence with access to testing within 10 miles of most households;\n•\nquality, timeliness, and consistency in reporting test results;\n•\ncontractual relationships with MCOs;\n•\nnumber and type of tests performed;\n•\nconnectivity solutions offered; and\n•\npricing of the laboratory’s services.\nIn addition to the factors listed above, the Company believes that the operational and economic efficiencies provided by its integrated service and logistics network, large-scale automated testing, and regular introduction of new technologies will allow the Company to compete effectively with other providers of laboratory services.\nBLS\nThe Company believes that in 2024, the global pharmaceutical industry spent more than $200 billion on R&D. Drug development services businesses like BLS typically derive most of their revenue from R&D, as well as marketing expenditures, of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. \nOutsourcing of R&D services to CROs and other service providers remains integral to the drug development process. The pharmaceutical market will continue to feel the pressure to improve return on investment, increase R&D productivity, stay abreast of scientific advancements and comply with stringent government regulations and attempts to reduce and control the price of prescription drugs, all supporting the outsourcing model. In the face of mounting complexity, the investment and amount of time required to develop new products are significant and have been increasing. These trends create opportunities for BLS and other companies providing drug development services that can help make the development process more efficient.\nThe drug development industry has many participants ranging from hundreds of small providers to a limited number of large companies with global capabilities. BLS competes against these small and large businesses, as well as in-house departments of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, and diagnostic companies, and to a lesser extent, selected academic research centers, universities, and teaching hospitals.\nBLS believes that the selection of a drug development partner is primarily based on the following factors, all of which the Company believes it competes favorably in: \n•\nreputation for quality and regulatory compliance; \n•\nefficient, timely performance;\n•\nexpertise and experience in operations;\n•\napplication of technology and innovation;\n•\nspecific therapeutic and scientific expertise;\n•\ndata and analytical capabilities;\n•\nability to enhance patient recruitment;\n•\nscope of service offerings; \n•\nstrengths in various geographic markets; \n•\nprice; \n•\nquality of facilities; \n•\nquality of relationships; \n•\nsize and scale;\n•\nability to support decentralized clinical trials;\n•\nability to develop CDx; and\n•\naccess to talent.\nQuality\nDx and BLS have comprehensive quality systems and processes appropriate for their respective businesses. The Company’s quality programs are overseen by Dx’s National Office of Quality, BLS’s Global Regulatory Compliance and Quality Assurance Unit, BLS’s central laboratory services expanded laboratory management services department, and the Company’s global supply chain management department and project management staff. The Company has procedures for monitoring its internal performance, as well as that of its vendors, suppliers, and other key stakeholders. In addition, various groups and \n19\nIndex\ndepartments within the Company provide oversight to monitor and control vendor products and performance and play an essential role in the Company’s approach to quality through improvements in processes and automation. \nVirtually all facets of the Company’s services are subject to quality programs and procedures, including accuracy and reproducibility of tests, turnaround time, customer service, marketing communications, data integrity, patient satisfaction, and billing. The Company’s quality programs include measures that compare current performance against desired performance goals to monitor critical aspects of service to its customers and patients. This includes licensing, credentialing, training, competency assessments of professional and technical staff, and internal auditing. In addition to the Company’s own quality programs, the Company’s laboratories, facilities, and processes are subject to on-site regulatory agency inspections and accreditation evaluations, surveys and proficiency testing by local or national government agencies and independent external accrediting programs, and inspections and audits by customers. \nThirty-five of the Company’s laboratories have received ISO 15189, ISO 17025, ISO 13485 and/or ISO 14791 accreditation, demonstrating that they meet international standards for quality and technical competence.\nInformation Systems \nThe Company is committed to developing and commercializing technology-enabled solutions it believes will support its operations and provide better care. The Company operates standard platforms for its core business services and its financial and reporting systems. These standard systems provide consistency within workflows and information as well as a high level of system availability, security, and stability. The primary laboratory systems include standardized support for molecular diagnostics, digital pathology, and enhanced specialty laboratory solutions. The Company’s centralized information systems are responsible for operational efficiencies, enabling the Company to achieve consistent, structured, and standardized operating results and effective patient care.  \nThe information systems used by Dx and BLS are discussed in more detail in the sections dedicated to each of those segments. The Company’s cybersecurity processes and systems are discussed in more detail under “Cybersecurity” in Item 1C. \nFor several years the Company has deployed AI and machine learning tools to supplement its existing data analysis projects and support greater efficiency in its operations. The Company is currently evaluating and testing various additional applications of AI and machine learning tools, while also implementing policies and processes to provide appropriate oversight over the use of AI and machine learning tools by the Company.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nThe Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect its proprietary technology. The Company has filed and obtained numerous patents in the U.S. and abroad, and regularly files patent applications, when appropriate, to establish and protect its proprietary technology. Occasionally, the Company also licenses U.S. and non-U.S. patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, and trademarks owned by others. The Company believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset, or license is material to its business as a whole.\nPatents covering the Company’s technologies are subject to challenges. Issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or declared unenforceable so that patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.  \nParties may file claims asserting that the Company’s technologies infringe on their intellectual property. The Company cannot predict whether parties will assert such claims against it, or whether those claims will harm its business. If the Company is forced to defend against such claims, the Company could face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As result of such disputes, the Company may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may require financial or other terms that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition.\nRegulation and Reimbursement\nGeneral\nBecause the Company operates in multiple distinct environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, it is subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory requirements. Both the clinical laboratory and the biopharma laboratory businesses are subject to significant governmental regulation at the international, national, state, and local levels. As described below, these regulations concern licensure and operation of clinical laboratories, claims submission and reimbursement for laboratory services, healthcare fraud and abuse, biopharma laboratory services, security and confidentiality of health information, quality, and environmental and occupational safety.\n20\nIndex\nRegulation of Clinical Laboratories\nVirtually all clinical laboratories operating in the U.S. must be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. In most cases, that certification is regulated by CMS through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), which requires that applicable clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Clinical laboratories in locations other than the U.S. are generally subject to comparable regulation in their respective jurisdictions.\nStandards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high-complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate-complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most CLIA requirements. All major and many smaller Company facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high-complexity testing. The Company’s remaining smaller testing sites hold CLIA certificates to perform moderate-complexity testing or a certificate of waiver. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records.\nThe Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all laboratory requirements applicable to its laboratories operating both within the U.S. and in other countries. The Company’s laboratories have continuing programs to maintain operations in compliance with all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the Company’s laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.\nFDA and Other Regulatory Agency Laws and Regulations\nVarious regulatory agencies, including CMS and the FDA in the U.S., regulate the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution, storage, import, export, performance, and surveillance of diagnostic and therapeutic offerings, including certain offerings provided by the Company and the development of therapeutic products that comprise the majority of BLS’s business. The FDA and other regulatory agencies periodically inspect and review the manufacturing processes and performance of diagnostic and therapeutic products, while CMS, certain state programs, and accreditation entities inspect and review the facilities, personnel, and procedures of clinical laboratories and their laboratory operations. The FDA and other regulatory agencies also periodically inspect test facilities that perform tests on samples from preclinical studies and on human subjects enrolled in such clinical studies of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. These agencies have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, such as fines, withdrawal of product approval, warning or untitled letters, seizures, recalls, injunctions, and other civil and criminal sanctions.\nSince 2014, there have been ongoing discussions and advocacy between stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory industry, the FDA, and Congress, about potential FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), which are assays developed and performed in-house by clinical laboratories and can be made available to the public without pre-market review by the FDA, with limited exceptions that require LDTs to follow pre-market requirements, such as during the COVID-19 public health emergency. \nOn September 29, 2023, the FDA released a proposed rule to regulate LDTs as medical devices, which was formally published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2023. The proposed rule sought to make explicit that in vitro diagnostic products (IVDs) are devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including when the manufacturer of the IVD is a clinical laboratory. In conjunction with this proposed rule and issuance of new regulations, the FDA proposed a policy by which the FDA would phase out its general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs over a period of four years after the publication of a final rule so that LDTs manufactured by a clinical laboratory would, over the transition period, fall under the existing enforcement approach for IVDs. The proposed rule would not grandfather existing tests or exempt academic medical centers or small laboratories, but the FDA requested public comments on whether it should include those features in a final rule. ACLA disputes FDA’s assertion that LDTs are medical devices and filed comments in December 2023 opposing the proposed rule and urging its withdrawal for the reasons set forth in ACLA’s comments. Both ACLA and the Company have urged FDA \n21\nIndex\nto continue working with Congress and stakeholders toward enactment of appropriate legislation instead of pursuing device regulation of LDTs through rulemaking.\nOn May 6, 2024, the FDA published a final rule adopting its proposal to regulate LDTs as medical devices over a four-year phase-in period, but with certain changes related to ongoing enforcement discretion for certain categories of LDTs. The final rule became effective on July 5, 2024, and in the absence of a successful legal challenge, the first phase of compliance obligations will begin on May 6, 2025. Most notably, under the final rule, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review and most quality system requirements (except for records requirements) for tests currently marketed as LDTs that were first marketed prior to the issuance of the final rule, as long as they are not significantly modified; intends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review and most quality system requirements (except for records requirements) for LDTs offered by a laboratory integrated within a healthcare system to meet an unmet need of patients receiving care within the same healthcare system; intends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review requirements for tests that are approved by the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (NYS CLEP); and intends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review requirements for certain modifications made to 510(k)-cleared and de novo classified tests by CLIA-certified, high-complexity laboratories, even if that 510(k) clearance or classification is held by a different manufacturer. However, the FDA noted that it could change these enforcement discretion policies at any time in the future. The Company expects to be in material compliance with the final rule at applicable compliance dates if the final rule remains in force.\nOn May 29, 2024, ACLA and its member company, HealthTrackRx, filed a civil action in the U.,S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Secretary of the HHS seeking to overturn the final rule on grounds that HHS (and by delegation, FDA) lacks jurisdiction to regulate LDTs as medical devices and that even if such jurisdiction exists, the rule is unlawfully arbitrary and capricious. A similar civil action filed by the Association for Molecular Pathology has been consolidated with the ACLA action.\nOn November 21, 2024, ACLA submitted a formal request to the transition team for then President-elect Donald Trump to announce a policy of non-enforcement of the final rule together with a notice of intent to rescind the rule through notice and comment rulemaking. Discussions with Congress and other stakeholders on potential legislative alternatives to the final rule are ongoing.\nThere are similar national and regional regulatory agencies and regulations in the jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in which the Company operates. For example, the European Union (EU) Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR) which became applicable on May 26, 2021, and the In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation (IVDR), which became applicable on May 26, 2022, established a new legislative framework for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs), including a rule-based classification and quality and safety standards. In contrast to the former Regulation, the IVDR also applies to IVDs used in diagnostic and therapeutic services provided outside the EU to patients based in the EU. After the new EU MDR and IVDR had come into force, it soon emerged that the transitional periods originally specified therein were not sufficiently long and were extended for the MDR up to December 31, 2028, and up to December 31, 2029, depending on the risk class of the device.\nBLS’s laboratory facilities and Dx’s clinical laboratory facilities that perform testing services in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials must conform to a range of standards and regulations, including good laboratory practice (GLP) and good clinical practice (GCP), current good manufacturing practice (cGMP), human subject protection and investigational product exemption regulations, and quality system regulation (QSR) requirements, as applicable. The preclinical and clinical testing intended to support applications for research or marketing, and the studies that the Company conducts, are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, as well as other pharmaceutical and medical device regulators in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates, which may include, without limitation, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom (UK), the European Union, the European Medicines Agency, the National Medical Products Administration in China, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan, to determine compliance with GLP, GCP, and cGMP, as well as other applicable standards and regulations. If a regulatory agency determines during an inspection that the Company’s equipment, facilities, laboratories, operations, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and GLP, GCP and/or cGMP standards, the regulatory agency may issue a formal notice (e.g., Form FDA 483), which may be followed by a warning letter or other enforcement actions if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. Noncompliance may result in, among other things, unanticipated compliance expenditures, the regulatory agency seeking civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, and/or other remedies against the Company, including suspension of its operations, and related customer contractual claims and other liabilities.\nThe FDA Modernization Act 2.0 was enacted in December 2022 as Section 3209 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. This Act amended Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to clarify the methods manufacturers and sponsors can use to investigate the safety and efficacy of a drug or the toxicity of a biosimilar biologic product to include tests on animals, as well as certain tests that are not performed on animals. Specifically, the Act replaces a statutory reference to “tests on animals” as a viable option for preclinical testing with a reference to “nonclinical tests”, which includes animal testing, \n22\nIndex\ncell-based assays, microphysiological systems, or bioprinted or computer models. The Act does not eliminate animal testing or require the use of non-animal models. FDA previously had the authority to allow non-animal data to be considered during safety and efficacy reviews of new drugs and had previously issued related guidance. However, many procedures intended to reduce animal tests are still in various stages of development. Such alternative methodologies must first be validated before FDA will approve of their use instead of validated animal models, so the practical impact of the Act is likely to be limited for some time.\nAdditionally, certain BLS services and activities, such as chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) services, must conform to cGMP. BLS is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and the MHRA, as well as other regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates, in order to assess, among other things, cGMP compliance. If a regulatory agency identifies deficiencies during an inspection, it may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. Failure to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in, among other things, fines, warnings or untitled letters, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, enforcement actions, product seizures or recalls, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.\nSome Dx offerings are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other similar national regulatory agencies in jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates. The FDA defines a medical device in part as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article which is intended for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man. FDA regulatory requirements include: all of the relevant elements of the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures; labeling regulations; restrictions on promotion and advertising; Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require the manufacturer to report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulations, which require manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA;, and other post-market requirements.\nOn January 31, 2024, the FDA issued a final rule amending the device current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the QSR to incorporate by reference the quality management system requirements of the international standard specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The revised regulation is now referred to as the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR).The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO 13485 are substantially similar to the requirements of the former QSR regulation, but the final rule establishes additional requirements that clarify certain expectations and certain concepts used in ISO 13485 to avoid inconsistencies with other applicable FDA requirements. The FDA will begin to enforce the QMSR requirements on the effective date, February 2, 2026.\nTo ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production, refusal to grant clearance or approvals of new devices, withdrawal of clearance or approval, and civil or criminal prosecution.\nAnimal Welfare Laws and Regulations\nThe conduct of animal research at BLS’s facilities in the U.S. must be in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals for research in the U.S., other than laboratory rats, mice, and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The AWA establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care, and recordkeeping. BLS complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the USDA and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the UK, and China for the care and use of regulated species. If the USDA determines that BLS’s equipment, facilities, laboratories, or processes do not comply with applicable AWA standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. The USDA may impose fines, suspend and/or revoke licenses and registrations, or confiscate research animals. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar laws and regulations with which the Company must also comply. In addition, certain of BLS’s animal-related activities may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and similar organizations in other jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n23\nIndex\nPayment for Clinical Laboratory Services\nIn 2024, Dx derived approximately 10.5% of its revenue directly from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, Dx’s other commercial laboratory testing business that is not directly related to Medicare or Medicaid nevertheless depends significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs, in part because customers often want a single laboratory to perform all of their testing services. In recent years, both governmental and private-sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs, including for clinical laboratory services.\nReimbursement under the PFS is capped at different rates in each Medicare Administrative Contractor’s jurisdiction. Pursuant to PAMA, unless modified by Congress, reimbursement under the CLFS is set at a national rate that is updated every three years for most tests. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients. Laboratories primarily bill and are reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. For beneficiaries that participate in managed Medicare and managed Medicaid plans, laboratory bills are submitted to and paid by MCOs that manage those plans. Approximately 8.8% of Dx’s revenue is reimbursed directly by Medicare under the CLFS.\nMany pathology services performed by Dx are reimbursed by Medicare under the PFS. The PFS assigns relative value units to each procedure or service, and a conversion factor is applied to calculate the reimbursement. The PFS is also subject to adjustment on an annual basis. Such adjustments can impact both the conversion factor and relative value units. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), the formula previously used to calculate the fee schedule conversion factor, would have resulted in significant decreases in payment for most physician services for each year since 2003. However, Congress intervened repeatedly to prevent these payment reductions, and the conversion factor was increased or frozen for the subsequent year. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) permanently replaced the SGR formula and transitioned PFS reimbursement to a value-based payment system. MACRA retroactively avoided a 21.2% reduction in PFS reimbursement that had been scheduled for April 1, 2015, and provided for PFS conversion factor increases of 0.5% from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and 0.5% in each of years 2016-2019, followed by no updates for 2020 through 2025, and updates that vary based on participation in alternative payment models in subsequent years. These changes to the conversion factor may be offset by reductions to the relative value units, as was the case with the 2016 PFS reductions. For 2022, Congress increased the conversion factor by 3.0% over the amount announced in the final rule, instead of allowing a 3.75% reduction to take effect. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Congress mitigated PFS cuts in 2023 and 2024 by 2.5% and 1.25%, respectively, that would otherwise have been reduced by 4.47% in 2023 based on the conversion factor put forward in the 2023 Medicare PFS Final Rule. Approximately 0.4% of Dx’s revenue is reimbursed under the PFS.\nIn addition to changes in reimbursement rates, Dx is also impacted by changes in coverage policies for laboratory tests and annual CPT coding revisions. Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements and payment policies negatively impact Dx’s ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Further, some payers require additional information to process claims, employ third-party utilization management tools, or have implemented prior authorization policies which delay or prohibit payment. \nFuture changes in national, state, and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of current regulations) affecting government payment for clinical laboratory testing could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nFurther healthcare reform could occur in 2025, including changes to the ACA and Medicare reform, as well as administrative requirements that may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services in ways that are currently unpredictable.\nPrivacy, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information and Other Personal Information\nIn the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was designed to address issues related to the security and confidentiality of health information and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions. These regulations apply to health plans and healthcare providers that conduct standard transactions electronically and healthcare clearinghouses (covered entities). Six such regulations include: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the Standard Unique Employer Identifier Rule; (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule; and (vi) the Health Plan Identifier Rule. The Company, which may act as a HIPAA covered entity in certain circumstances, believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with each of the HIPAA Rules identified above.\nThe U.S. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) strengthened and expanded the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also imposes a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered \n24\nIndex\nentities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when unsecured PHI is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach. \nThe Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that individuals have with respect to their PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of PHI. \nOn February 6, 2014, CMS and HHS published final regulations that amended the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to receive copies of their test reports from laboratories subject to HIPAA, or to request that copies of their test reports be transmitted to designated third parties. \nOn April 22, 2024, HHS issued a final rulemaking containing modifications to the HIPAA Privacy Rule to address the use or disclosure of PHI in relation to the provision of reproductive health care. The Company will implement appropriate processes to manage compliance with these changes as applicable.  On December 27, 2024, HHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) containing potential modifications to the HIPAA Security Rule addressing prescriptive requirements for administrative, physical, and technical safeguards in response to increased cybersecurity incidents in the health care industry. The public comment period for the NPRM is expected to close on March 7, 2025. The Company is monitoring the NPRM process. If modifications to the HIPAA Security Rule are adopted, they may impact the Company’s compliance obligations under HIPAA.    \nThe administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandate the adoption of standard unique identifiers for healthcare providers. The intent of these provisions is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic transmission of health information. The National Provider Identifier Rule requires that all HIPAA-covered healthcare providers, whether they are individuals or organizations, must obtain an NPI to identify themselves in standard HIPAA transactions. NPI replaces the unique provider identification number and other provider numbers previously assigned by payers and other entities for the purpose of identifying healthcare providers in standard electronic transactions. \nViolations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also requires HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents. \nThe total cost associated with complying with the ongoing requirements of HIPAA and HITECH is not expected to be material to the Company’s operations or cash flows. However, future regulations and interpretations of HIPAA and HITECH could impose significant costs on the Company.\nThe information blocking provisions (Information Blocking Rules) of the 21st Century Cures Act became effective on April 5, 2021. The Information Blocking Rules prohibit covered actors, including healthcare providers, from engaging in activity that is likely to interfere with the access, exchanges, or use of electronic health information unless such activity falls into one of eight exceptions. The Information Blocking Rules provide for civil monetary penalties for noncompliance by healthcare information technology vendors and, separately, “appropriate disincentives” for noncompliance by healthcare providers.\nIn addition to the regulations described above, numerous other data protection, privacy and similar laws govern the confidentiality, security, use, and disclosure of personal information, as well as breach notification responsibilities. These laws vary by jurisdiction, but they most commonly regulate or restrict the collection, use, and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has authority to regulate unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to data privacy and security. If the Company’s public statements about collection, use, or disclosure of personal information are perceived to be inconsistent with the Company’s actual practices, the Company may face accusations of unfairness or deception under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 or state law equivalents. In addition, some state laws are more restrictive and, therefore, are not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. \nEffective August 14, 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of HHS (SAMHSA) announced the finalization of proposed changes to the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulation. This regulation protects the confidentiality of patient records relating to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment that are maintained in connection with the performance of any federally assisted program or activity relating to substance use disorder education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research. Under the regulation, patient identifying information may only be released with the individual’s written consent, subject to certain limited exceptions. The latest changes to this regulation seek to better facilitate care coordination, while maintaining more stringent confidentiality of substance use disorder information. The Company adopted changes to its policies and procedures necessary for compliance.\n25\nIndex\nCongress and state legislatures also have been adopting legislation relating to privacy and data protection. For example, on June 28, 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA created transparency requirements and granted California residents several new rights with regard to their personal information. In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) ballot initiative, which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA). The amendments to the CCPA introduced by the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023. Implementing regulations have been introduced by the CPPA and additional regulations are anticipated. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. Other states have passed legislation similar to the CCPA that generally mirror the principles and requirements of the CCPA; however, some of these laws do not provide for a private right of action. Additionally, Connecticut, Washington and Nevada have passed legislation specific to consumer health data. The Company has developed appropriate processes to manage compliance with these laws as applicable.\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes requirements applicable to the use and transfer of personal data and imposes penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR, as well as the UK’s implementation -- the UK General Data Protection Regulation -- requires transparency with regard to the means and purposes of processing of personal data, collection of consent to process personal data in certain circumstances, the ability to provide records of processing upon request by a supervisory authority or data controller, implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to maintain security of personal data, notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities, data controllers, and individuals within expedient time frames, and performance of data protection impact assessments for certain processing activities. The GDPR also provides individual data subjects with certain rights, where applicable, including the right of access, the right to rectification, the right to be forgotten, the right to restrict or object to processing, and the right to data portability. The GDPR requires that personal data may only be transferred outside of the EU to a country that offers an adequate level of data protection under standards set by the EU, or where such transfer is otherwise pursuant to a legal framework approved by the EU. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU released its decision in Data Protection Commission v. Facebook Ireland Limited, (Schrems II), which invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a legal framework for the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, and suggesting additional safeguards for the use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as a legal framework for the transfer of personal data outside of the EU. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission release updated SCCs, which, in part, adopted many of the additional safeguards highlighted in the Schrems II decision. Companies using SCCs for the transfer of personal data outside of the EU are required to use the new SCCs or an alternate approved form of data transfers. The Company has established processes and frameworks to manage compliance with the GDPR and other global privacy and data protection requirements, and to manage preparation for future enacted regulations. Compliance could impose significant costs on the Company.\nIn addition to the GDPR, numerous other countries have laws governing the collection, use, disclosure, and transmission (including cross-border transfer) of personal information, including medical information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection is complex and continually evolving. Data protection regulations have been enacted or updated in regions where the Company does business including in Asia and Europe, and in countries such as Canada, India, and the UK. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in, among other things, civil, criminal and contractual liability, fines, regulatory sanctions, and damage to the Company’s reputation.\nPotential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may also increase compliance costs and impact operations as the Company continues to develop, test, adopt, and maintain AI within the Company’s operations and in its offerings. The rapid evolution of AI, and potential government regulation, will require the application of resources to allow the Company to implement AI appropriately in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact, including from the exposure of Company or third-party information or the Company relying on flawed AI outputs. The Company has implemented an AI Code of Ethics and established an AI Ethics Board to review and help maintain compliance with AI ethical principles and regulatory requirements in the development and use of AI systems, including generative AI tools.  \nFraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations\nExisting U.S. laws governing federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), OIG, and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The U.S. government’s enforcement efforts have been conducted under statutory authorities such as those contained in HIPAA, which includes several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund U.S., state and local law enforcement efforts, and in the Deficit \n26\nIndex\nReduction Act of 2005, which included requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the U.S. False Claims Act. Amendments to the False Claims Act, and other enhancements to the U.S. fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, have further increased fraud and abuse enforcement efforts and compliance risks. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identification (whether or not paid through any fault of the recipient); failure to comply with this requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. \nThe U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of, Medicare, Medicaid, or other U.S. federal healthcare program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in U.S. federal healthcare programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations that specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government healthcare programs).\nFrom time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the healthcare industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other fraud and abuse laws. OIG Special Fraud Alerts and Advisory Opinions relevant to the Company set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories, healthcare providers, and biopharmaceutical manufacturers that raise issues under the U.S. fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering or providing discounted laboratory services billed to referral sources in return for referrals of other tests that are billed to U.S. federal healthcare programs; (iii) providing free testing to physicians’ managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pickup and disposal of biohazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; (vi) providing free testing for healthcare providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called “professional courtesy” testing); (vii) rental of space in physician offices by equipment suppliers or other healthcare entities to which the physicians make referrals; (viii) compensation paid by laboratories to physicians and hospitals for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries; (ix) remuneration provided to physicians and other health care professionals by pharmaceutical and medical device companies in connection with company-sponsored speaker programs; (x) arrangements between telemedicine companies and healthcare professionals that result in the fraudulent ordering or prescribing of medically unnecessary services, including prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and clinical laboratory testing; and (xi) the provision of free genetic and other testing sponsored by biopharmaceutical manufacturers for use in making diagnostic or other clinical decisions related to use of the manufacturers’ products.\nIn addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, in October 2018, the U.S. enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA), as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. As drafted, an EKRA prohibition on incentive compensation to sales employees is inconsistent with the federal anti-kickback statute and regulations, which permit payment of employee incentive compensation, a practice that is common in the industry. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued, and there is no additional DOJ or other government guidance to indicate how and to what extent it will be applied and enforced in the industry. The Company continues to work through its trade association to address the scope of EKRA.\nUnder another U.S. statute, known as the Stark Law or “physician self-referral” prohibition, physicians who have a financial or a compensation relationship with a clinical laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare or Medicaid patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (i) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (ii) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (iii) ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician’s own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; (iv) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and (v) certain space \n27\nIndex\nand equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just government reimbursement programs.\nIn December 2020, the OIG and CMS published final rules to amend certain regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, respectively. The amendments were primarily intended to alleviate perceived impediments to coordinated care and value-based compensation arrangements through new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute and new exceptions to the Stark Law and have varying degrees of applicability to laboratories. The CMS final rule incorporates laboratories and permits support for value-based arrangements, under certain conditions for purposes of the Stark Law. However, the OIG final rule generally excludes laboratories from protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for value-based arrangements. \nThere are a variety of other types of U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims and that require certain companies to disclose payments and other transfers of value to certain healthcare professionals and providers. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws. The Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other U.S. or state healthcare programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a U.S. healthcare program, or material loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nEnrollment and re-enrollment in U.S. healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to certain program integrity requirements intended to protect the programs from fraud, waste, and abuse. In September 2019, CMS published a final rule implementing program integrity enhancements to provider enrollment requiring Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) providers and suppliers to disclose on an enrollment application or a revalidation application any current or previous direct or indirect affiliation with a provider or supplier that (i) has uncollected debt; (ii) has been or is subject to a payment suspension under a federal health care program; (iii) has been or is excluded by the OIG from Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP, or (iv) has had its Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP billing privileges denied or revoked. This rule permits CMS to deny enrollment based on such an affiliation when CMS determines that the affiliation poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. CMS is phasing in this new affiliation disclosure requirement.\nIn November 2021, CMS published the 2022 Medicare PFS Final Rule, which included further program integrity requirements. CMS finalized its proposal to expand the categories of parties within the purview of the denial and revocation provisions to include excluded administrative or management services personnel who furnish services payable by a federal healthcare program, such as a billing specialist, accountant, or human resources specialist. CMS also codified the billing privilege deactivation rebuttal process, under which a provider or supplier would have 15 calendar days from receipt of written notice of a deactivation to submit a rebuttal, and CMS could, in its discretion, extend the 15-day period to account for certain special situations. In addition, CMS defined factors it would use to determine whether revocation or suspension of billing privileges is appropriate due to a pattern or practice of non-compliant billing, which would be: (i) the percentage of submitted claims that were denied during the period under consideration; (ii) whether the provider or supplier has any history of final adverse actions and the nature of any such actions; (iii) the type of billing non-compliance and the specific facts surrounding said non-compliance (to the extent this can be determined); and (iv) any other information regarding the provider’s or supplier’s specific circumstances that CMS deems relevant to the determination. This is a reduction in the number of factors that were previously considered and a revision of some previous factors. \nEnvironment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability\nThe Company is subject to licensing and requirements under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations, designed to minimize risk to employee health and safety and to the environment, include the safe handling, use, transportation, and disposal of potentially infectious and hazardous materials; the assessment of potential work-related risks and establishment of work practice and engineering controls, and providing protective clothing and equipment, training, and medical surveillance. \nThe Company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. The Company participates in the CDP and the EcoVadis sustainable procurement rating processes. In 2023, the Company’s greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction science-based targets were accepted by the Science Based Targets initiative, and the Company has committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 42% and Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by year end 2030, versus a 2020 baseline. \nEnergy-saving measures at Company facilities include for example, installation of energy efficient boilers, chillers, ventilation systems, and light-emitting diode lighting, and engaging in waste-to-energy disposition. The Company is committed \n28\nIndex\nto reducing the fuel use of its courier fleet, and in 2024 the Company added nearly 469 hybrid vehicles to its fleet, to help achieve its goals of reducing fuel use. Funding for these and similar projects continued through 2024 and is expected to continue through 2027.\nThe Company seeks to comply with all relevant environment, employee-health, and safety laws and regulations. Failure to comply could subject the Company to various administrative and/or other enforcement actions.\nDrug Testing\nDrug testing for public sector employees is regulated by the SAMHSA, which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to be approved to perform drug testing on employees of U.S. government contractors and certain other entities. To the extent that the Company’s laboratories perform such testing, each must be certified as meeting SAMHSA standards. The Company’s laboratories in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Raritan, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; Southaven, Mississippi; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Portland, Oregon, are all SAMHSA certified. Each laboratory also maintains state licensure and laboratory certifications required to provide testing for private sector employers.  \nControlled Substances\nBLS handles controlled substances as part of the services it provides in preclinical testing. The use of controlled substances is regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and its implementing regulations. The CSA establishes, among other things, certain registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export, and other requirements for controlled substances. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with these requirements as applicable. Violations of these rules may result in criminal and civil fines and penalties.\nCompliance Program\nThe Company maintains a global compliance program that includes ongoing evaluation and monitoring of its compliance with the laws and regulations of the U.S. and the other countries in which it has operations. The objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement, monitor, and update compliance safeguards, as appropriate. Although the Company is subject to a broad range of regulations, its compliance program has a particular focus on regulations related to healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, physician self-referral, government reimbursement programs, anti-bribery/anti-corruption, anti-human trafficking, and trade sanctions, among others. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs, risk assessment, monitoring and auditing activities, and providing systems for reporting and investigation of potential or actual compliance concerns. The compliance program demonstrates the Company’s commitment to conducting business at the highest standards of ethical conduct and integrity.\nThe Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations and biopharma laboratory services business. The clinical laboratory industry and biopharma laboratory services industries are, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. In addition, the applicability or interpretation of statutes and regulations may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science, healthcare technology, and healthcare organizations. Applicable statutes and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that would materially adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations necessary to operate, as well as potential liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.",
  "item7": "Item 7.       MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL (dollars in millions)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s revenues were $13,008.9, an increase of 7.0% from $12,161.6 for the corresponding period in 2023. The 7.0% increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, was primarily due to organic revenue of 3.9%, acquisitions, net of divestitures of 2.8%, and favorable foreign currency translation of 0.2%. The 3.9% increase in organic revenue was due to a 4.9% increase in the Company’s organic Base Business (Base Business includes the Company’s business operations except for COVID-19 Testing), partially offset by a 1.0% decrease in COVID-19 Testing.\n The Company defines organic growth as the increase in revenue excluding the year over year impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. Acquisition and divestiture impact is considered for a twelve-month period following the close of each transaction.\nSeparation of Fortrea Holdings Inc.\nOn June 30, 2023, Labcorp completed the previously announced separation (Spin-off) of its former Clinical Development and Commercialization Services (CDCS) business into Fortrea.\nAll historical operating results of Fortrea are presented as Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The spin-off is expected to be treated as tax-free for the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAs a result of the separation of Fortrea, the Company recast segment results to exclude the historical results of the CDCS business for all periods presented. The remaining operations of the previously reported Drug Development segment have been renamed the Biopharma Laboratory Services (BLS) segment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions)\nThe following tables present the financial measures that management considers to be the most significant indicators of the Company\n’\ns performance. For discussion of \n2023\n results and comparison with \n2022\n results refer to \n“\nManagement\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\n”\n in the Company\n’\ns Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n.\nRevenues\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nDx\n$\n10,144.3 \n$\n9,415.1 \n7.7 \n%\nBLS\n2,922.6 \n2,774.2 \n5.3 \n%\nIntercompany eliminations and other\n(58.0)\n(27.7)\n109.4 \n%\nTotal\n$\n13,008.9 \n$\n12,161.6 \n7.0 \n%\nDx revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, were $10,144.3, an increase of 7.7% compared to revenues of $9,415.1 in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was due to organic revenue of 4.1% and acquisitions, net of divestitures of 3.7%. The 4.1% increase in organic revenue was due to a 5.4% contribution from organic Base Business, partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in COVID-19 Testing. Total Base Business growth compared to the Base Business in the prior year was 9.2%.\nTotal volume, measured by requisitions, increased by 5.3% as acquisitions, net of divestitures, volume contributed growth of 2.7%, and organic volume increased by 2.6%. Organic volume was impacted by a 3.3% increase in the Base Business, partially offset by a 0.8% decrease in COVID-19 Testing. Price/mix increased by 2.5% due to organic Base Business growth of 2.1% and acquisitions, net of divestitures, of 1.0%, partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 Testing of 0.5%.\nBLS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, were $2,922.6, an increase of 5.3% over revenues of $2,774.2 in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to organic growth of 4.3% and favorable foreign currency translation of 1.1%. \n49\nIndex\nCost of Revenues\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nCost of revenues\n$\n9,384.5\n$\n8,796.7\n6.7 \n%\nCost of revenues as a % of revenues\n72.1 \n%\n72.3 \n%\n \nCost of revenues increased 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with corresponding period in 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 72.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 72.3% for corresponding period in 2023. This decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs and lower COVID-19 Testing.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n2,230.0\n$\n2,021.4\n10.3 \n%\nSG&A as a % of revenues\n17.1 \n%\n16.6 \n%\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 16.6% for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to higher personnel costs, a reduction in COVID-19 Testing revenues, and the impact from the Invitae transaction, partially offset by LaunchPad savings and demand.\nGoodwill and Other Asset Impairments\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nGoodwill and other asset impairments\n$\n5.3 \n$\n349.0 \n(98.5)\n%\nThe impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024, were primarily due to the decommissioning of an information system and a robotic asset.

The charges were comprised of $43.0 in severance and other personnel costs, and $5.9 in facility-related costs primarily associated with general integration activities. The charges were adjusted by the reversal of previously established liability of $2.5 in unused severance and $0.4 in unused facility-related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $49.1. The charges were comprised of $33.4 in severance and other personnel costs and $22.3 in facility-related costs primarily associated with general integration activities. The charges were adjusted by the reversal of previously established liability of $1.7 in unused severance and $4.9 in unused facility-related costs.\n50\nIndex\nInterest Expense\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nInterest expense\n$\n208.3 \n$\n199.6 \n4.4 \n%\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the corresponding period in 2023 is primarily due to higher borrowings under its revolving credit facility, senior notes, and the new accounts receivable securitization facility.\nEquity Method Income, Net\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nEquity method income, net\n$\n(1.4)\n$\n(1.4)\n— \n%\nEquity method income, net represents the Company’s ownership share in joint venture partnerships along with equity investments in other companies in the health care industry, which remained flat in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the corresponding period in 2023.\nOther, Net\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nOther, net\n$\n60.2 \n$\n15.5 \n288.4 \n%\nOther, net for the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily due to $80.0 of transition services fees charged to Fortrea related to administrative and IT systems support. The costs to provide these services are included in operating income, but the service fees are included in other income. In addition, the Company recorded a $6.4 gain related to the divestiture of Beacon Laboratory Benefit Solutions, Inc. This income was partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses of $15.3 and an $11.4 loss on investments. \nOther, net for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to $46.1 of transition services fees charged to Fortrea related to administrative and IT systems support, partially offset by pension plan settlement charges of $10.9 and a $4.8 loss on investments. \nProvision for Income Taxes\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nIncome tax expense\n$\n212.4 \n$\n188.5 \nIncome tax expense as a % of income before tax\n22.1 \n%\n33.1 \n%\nThe decrease in effective tax rate as compared with the prior year is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of the prior year goodwill impairment of the ED reporting unit, while no goodwill impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOperating Results by Segment\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nDx segment operating income\n$\n1,606.3 \n$\n1,591.3 \n0.9 \n%\nDx segment operating margin\n15.8 \n%\n16.9 \n%\n(1.1)\n%\nBLS segment operating income\n458.9 \n396.3 \n15.8 \n%\nBLS segment operating margin\n15.7 \n%\n14.3 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nSegment operating income\n2,065.2 \n1,987.6 \n3.9 \n%\nGeneral corporate and unallocated expenses\n(670.8)\n(644.1)\n4.1 \n%\nAmortization of intangibles and other assets\n(256.4)\n(219.8)\n16.7 \n%\nRestructuring and other charges\n(46.0)\n(49.1)\n(6.3)\n%\nGoodwill and other asset impairments\n(5.3)\n(349.0)\n(98.5)\n%\nTotal operating income\n$\n1,086.7 \n$\n725.6 \n49.8 \n%\n51\nIndex\nDx operating income was $1,606.3 for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 0.9% over operating income of $1,591.3 in the corresponding period of 2023, and Dx operating margin decreased 110 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to higher personnel costs, partially offset by organic demand.\nBLS operating income was $458.9 for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 15.8% from operating income of $396.3 in the corresponding period of 2023, and BLS operating margin increased 140 basis points year over year. The increase was primarily due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. \nGeneral corporate expenses are comprised primarily of administrative services such as executive management, human resources, legal, finance, corporate affairs, and information technology. Corporate expenses were $670.8 for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 4.1% over corporate expenses of $644.1 in the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to higher costs related to acquisitions and personnel.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars and shares in millions)\nThe Company’s strong cash-generating capability and financial condition typically have provided ready access to capital markets. The Company’s principal source of liquidity is operating cash flow, supplemented by proceeds from debt offerings. The Company’s senior unsecured revolving credit facility is further discussed in Note 11 Debt to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIn summary the Company’s cash flows were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by continuing operating activities\n$\n1,585.8 \n$\n1,202.3 \nNet cash used for continuing investing activities\n(1,366.8)\n(1,146.8)\nNet cash provided by (used for) continuing financing activities\n779.9 \n(1,559.0)\nEffect of exchange rate on changes in cash and cash equivalents\n(17.0)\n9.9 \nNet cash impact from discontinued operations\n— \n1,600.4 \nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n981.9 \n$\n106.8 \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024, and 2023 totaled $1,518.7 and $536.8, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as time deposits and other money market investments, which have original maturities of three months or less.  \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s continuing operations provided $1,585.8 of cash as compared to $1,202.3 in 2023. The $383.5 increase in cash provided from operations in 2024, as compared with the corresponding 2023 period, was primarily due to higher cash earnings and favorable working capital requirements.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used for continuing investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $1,366.8 as compared to $1,146.8 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in business acquisitions and higher capital expenditures.  \nCapital expenditures were $489.9 and $453.6 for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2024 were 3.8% of revenues, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the Company’s core businesses. The Company expects this level of spending to remain consistent in 2025, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the Company’s core businesses, facility expansion and updates, projects related to its LaunchPad initiative, and further acquisition integration initiatives. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by continuing financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $779.9 compared to cash used in continuing financing activities of $1,559.0 for the year ended December 31, 2023. This movement in cash within financing activities for 2024, as compared to 2023, was primarily due to $2,000.0 of proceeds from new debt securities and $300.0 of proceeds from the new accounts receivable facility described below, partially offset by $1,000.0 of payments towards the Company’s senior notes, $250.1 of share repurchases, and $243.1 of dividends paid, compared to $1,000.0 of share repurchases and $300.0 of payments towards the Company’s senior notes, and $254.0 of dividends paid in 2023.\n52\nIndex\nOn September 23, 2024, LCAH (the Issuer) entered into a base indenture with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee) (the 2024 Indenture). On September 23, 2024, the Company, the Issuer and the Trustee entered into supplemental indentures to the 2024 Indenture under which the Issuer issued, and the Company guaranteed, $2,000.0 in debt securities, consisting of $650.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.35% senior notes due 2030, $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.55% senior notes due 2032, and $850.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.80% senior notes due 2034, with interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing April 1, 2025. Net proceeds from these offerings were approximately $1,983.0 after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses of the offering. The net proceeds were used to redeem or repay indebtedness and, to the extent not used for such purpose, for other general corporate purposes. Indebtedness redeemed or repaid or to be redeemed or repaid at or prior to maturity were the Company’s 2.30% senior notes due December 2024, its 3.60% senior notes due February 2025, and $500.0 of borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nOn January 13, 2023, LCAH amended and restated its revolving credit facility. It consists of a five-year revolving facility in the principal amount of up to $1,000.0, with the option of increasing the facility by up to an additional $500.0, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders to provide such additional amounts and certain other customary conditions. The Company is required to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility, at a per annum rate ranging from 0.100% to 0.225%, depending on the Company’s debt ratings. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s election, either (x) a LIBOR (changed to SOFR in 2023) rate plus a margin ranging from 0.775% to 1.275% or (y) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0% to 0.275%, in each case, depending on the Company’s debt ratings.\nOn August 23, 2024, the Company and a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle entered into a $300.0 three-year accounts receivable securitization facility with PNC Bank, National Association (PNC) as administrative agent (AR Facility). The AR Facility provides for purchases of accounts receivable by PNC in an amount of up to $300.0 through August of 2027 and may increase to up to $700.0, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nOn January 31, 2025, the Company amended its AR Facility (AR Facility Amendment). The AR Facility Amendment increased the amount the Company can borrow from PNC from $300.0 to $700.0 through August of 2027. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the AR Facility Amendment (i) the Toronto-Dominion Bank became a party to the underlying receivables purchase agreement as a committed purchaser through January 2026 and (ii) MUFG Bank Ltd. and certain of its related conduit purchasers became parties to the underlying receivables purchase agreement as purchasers and the loans or investments of such conduit purchasers may accrue interest as specified in the AR Facility Amendment and receivables purchase agreement.\nOn February 18, 2025, the Company borrowed an additional $225.0 under the AR Facility Amendment, bringing the amount outstanding under the AR Facility Amendment to $525.0.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had $1,518.7 of Cash and cash equivalents and $1,000.0 of available borrowings under its revolving credit facility, which does not mature until 2026. Under the Company’s credit facilities and indentures relating to the Company’s senior notes, the Company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment grade-rated borrowers, and with respect to the credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain leverage ratios. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facilities and the indentures related to the Company’s outstanding senior notes as of December 31, 2024. The Company expects that it will remain in compliance with all covenants associated with its existing debt obligations for the next twelve months.\nOn July 24, 2024, the Board adopted a new share repurchase plan authorizing the repurchase of up to $1,000.0 maximum value of the Company’s shares in addition to the remaining amount outstanding under the previous plan. At December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding authorization from its Board to purchase up to $1,280.4 maximum value of Company Common Stock. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid $243.1 in Common Stock dividends. On January 8, 2025, the Company announced a cash dividend of $0.72 per share of Common Stock for the first quarter, or approximately $61.0 in the aggregate. The dividend will be payable on March 12, 2025, to stockholders of record of all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at the close of business on February 27, 2025. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Company’s Board.\nGuarantor Information\nIn connection with the Reorganization, the Company, LCAH and the Trustee entered into a seventeenth supplemental indenture (the Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture) to the indenture, dated as of November 19, 2010, between LCAH and the Trustee (the 2010 Indenture). In addition, the Company, LCAH and the Trustee entered into the 2024 Indenture (the 2010 Indenture, together with the 2024 Indenture, the Indentures). The Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture, among other things, provides for the full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of LCAH’s obligations under the 2010 Indenture and each \n53\nIndex\nseries of senior unsecured notes issued and outstanding thereunder, and the 2024 Indenture provides for the full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of LCAH’s obligations and each series of senior unsecured notes issued and outstanding, thereunder (collectively, the Labcorp Holdings Guarantees). Also, the Indentures permit the Company to satisfy LCAH’s reporting obligations so long as the Labcorp Holdings Guarantees remain in place and the Company’s financial statements and other information comply with the requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. \nAt December 31, 2024, there was $4,073.2 and $2,000.0 aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding senior notes of LCAH, issued under the 2010 Indenture and the 2024 Indenture, respectively, that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, separate consolidated financial statements of LCAH have not been presented. As permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial infor\nmation for LCAH because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of LCAH are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors. \nCredit Ratings\nThe investment grade debt ratings from Moody’s and S&P contribute to the Company’s ability to access capital markets.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any variable interest entities or special purpose entities whose financial results are not included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company does not have any off-balance sheet financing other than normal, short-term leases and letters of credit.\nOther Commercial Commitments\nThe Company has debt instruments outstanding. At December 31, 2024, the Company had total future payments of $6,373.9, with $1,000.4 payable within 12 months.\nThe Company has leases for patient service centers, laboratories and testing facilities, clinical facilities, general office spaces, vehicles, and office and laboratory equipment. At December 31, 2024, the Company had total future lease payments of $1,140.3, with $190.7 payable within 12 months.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $102.7, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs which are renewed annually.\nThe contractual value of the noncontrolling interest put in the Company’s Ontario subsidiary totaled $14.3 and $15.5 at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and has been classified as mezzanine equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBased on current and projected levels of cash flows from operations, coupled with availability under its revolving credit facility, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its anticipated short-term and long-term cash needs for the next 12 months and the reasonably foreseeable future; however, the Company continually reassesses its liquidity position in light of market conditions and other relevant factors.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. While the Company believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company’s Audit Committee periodically reviews the Company’s significant accounting policies. The Company’s critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:\n•\nRevenue recognition; \n•\nBusiness combinations;\n•\nIncome taxes;\n•\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived assets; and\n•\nLegal contingencies.\n54\nIndex\nRevenue Recognition\nDx\nWithin the Dx segment, a revenue transaction is initiated when Dx receives a requisition form to perform a diagnostic test. The information provided on the requisition form is used to determine the party that will be billed for the testing performed and the expected reimbursement. Dx recognizes revenue and satisfies its performance obligation for services rendered when the testing process is complete, and the associated results are reported. The Dx segment also enters into lab management agreements which have monthly and non-testing-based fees which are recognized each month as the services are provided. Revenues are distributed among four payer portfolios —clients, patients, Medicare and Medicaid, and third party. Dx considers negotiated discounts and anticipated adjustments, including historical collection experience for the payer portfolio, when revenues are recorded. \nThe following are descriptions of the Dx payer portfolios:\nClients\nClient payers represent the portion of Dx’s revenue related to physicians, hospitals, health systems, accountable care organizations, employers, and other entities where payment is received exclusively from the entity ordering the testing service. Generally, client revenues are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at Dx’s client list price, less any negotiated discount. A portion of client billing is for laboratory management services, collection kits and other non-testing offerings. In these cases, revenue is recognized when services are rendered or delivered. \nPatients\nThis portfolio includes revenue from uninsured patients and member cost-share for insured patients (e.g., coinsurance, deductibles, and non-covered services). Uninsured patients are billed based upon Dx’s patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. Dx bills insured patients as directed by their health plan and after consideration of the fees and terms associated with an established health plan contract.\nMedicare and Medicaid\nThis portfolio relates to fee-for-service revenue from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs. Net revenue from these programs is based on the fee schedule established by the related government authority. In addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining net revenue. Any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. These adjustments are not material to Dx’s results of operations in any period presented\n.\nThird Party\nThird party includes revenue related to MCOs. The majority of Dx’s third-party revenue is reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. These payers are billed at Dx’s established list price and revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. The majority of Dx’s MCO revenues are recorded based upon contractually negotiated fee schedules with revenues for non-contracted MCOs recorded based on historical reimbursement experience.\nThird-party reimbursement is also received through capitation agreements with MCOs and IPAs. Under capitated agreements, revenue is recognized based on a negotiated per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by Dx from a capitation pool. When the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. Under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. Dx recognizes revenue monthly, based upon the established capitation rate or anticipated distribution from a capitated pool.  \nDx has a formal process to estimate implicit price concessions for uncollectable accounts. The majority of Dx’s collection risk is related to accounts receivable from both insured and uninsured patients who are unwilling or unable to pay. Anticipated write-offs are recorded as adjustments to revenue at an amount considered necessary to record the segment’s revenue at its net realizable value. In addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials and other external factors that could affect the collectability of its receivables are considered when determining revenue and the net receivable amount. Any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. These adjustments are not material to Dx’s results of operations in any period presented.\nBLS\nBLS revenue is generally recognized over time, as the services are delivered to the customer, based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the services to be provided. The majority of BLS’s contracts contain a single \n55\nIndex\nperformance obligation, as BLS provides a significant service of integrating all promises in the contract and the promises are highly interdependent and interrelated with one another. For contracts that include multiple performance obligations, BLS allocates the contract value to the goods and services based on a customer price list, if available. If a price list is not available, BLS will estimate the transaction price using either market prices or an “expected cost plus margin” approach. The total contract value is estimated at the beginning of the contract, and is equal to the amount expected to be billed to the customer. These contracts generally take the form of fixed-price or fee-for-service arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope.\nFixed-price contracts are typically recognized as revenue over time based on a proportional-performance basis, using either input or output methods that are specific to the service provided. In an output method, revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of output achieved by the total units of output required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. When using an input method, revenue is recognized by dividing the actual costs incurred by the total estimated cost expected to complete the contract, and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. Contract costs principally include direct labor costs, research model costs, and allocated overhead costs. The estimate of total costs expected to complete the contract requires significant judgment and these estimates are reviewed periodically. Any adjustments to these estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known.\nFee-for-service contracts are typically priced based on transaction volume or time and materials. For volume-based contracts, the contract value is entirely variable, and revenue is recognized as the specific service is completed. For services billed based on time and materials, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient.\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Generally, when contract modifications create new performance obligations, the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. When contract modifications change existing performance obligations, the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. \nMost contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to BLS of expenses incurred and fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to BLS of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by BLS under the contract if it had not been terminated early. Termination fees are included in revenues when services have been performed and realization is assured.\nBLS incurs sales commissions in the process of obtaining contracts with customers, which are recoverable through the service fees in the contract. Sales commissions that are payable upon contract award are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected contract term, along with related payroll tax expense. The amortization of commission expense is based on the weighted-average contract duration for all commissionable awards in the respective business in which the commission expense is paid, which approximates the period over which goods and services are transferred to the customer. The amortization period of sales commissions ranges from approximately 1 to 5 years, depending on the business. For businesses that enter into primarily short-term contracts, BLS applies the practical expedient, which allows costs to obtain a contract to be expensed when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. Amortization of assets from sales commissions is included in selling, general, and administrative expense.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combination transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reports the results of operations of the acquired entities from its respective date of acquisition. Assets acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimated fair values are based on various valuation methodologies, including an income approach using primarily discounted cash flow techniques for the customer relationships intangible assets. The aforementioned income methods utilize management’s estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the assets acquired are recorded as goodwill. The goodwill reflects management’s expectations of the ability to gain access to the acquired entities’ historical patient base and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities based on positive industry and market conditions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely \n56\nIndex\non the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, the Company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the Company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company records interest and penalties in Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The annual impairment test for goodwill includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company may also choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in its goodwill assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment. The Company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. \nIn the qualitative assessment, the Company considers relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, (ii) financial performance versus management’s annual and five-year strategic plans, (iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in offerings provided by the reporting unit. If applicable, performance in recent years is compared to forecasts included in prior quantitative valuations. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, if the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying values of the reporting unit, then no quantitative assessment is performed.\nThe quantitative assessment includes the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to the present value using the reporting unit’s weighted-average cost of capital. For the market-based approach, the Company utilizes a number of factors such as publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the Company, as well as operating results, business plans, market multiples, and present value techniques. Based upon the range of estimated values developed from the income and market-based methods, the Company determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired, and no further review is required. \nThe income-based fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management’s control. At the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:\n•\nAnnual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, working capital changes, capital spending and income taxes for at least a five-year forecast period.\n•\nA terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. The terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit, and economic conditions.\n•\nA discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from the comparable companies, and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate may consider any specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.\nUnder the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of the reporting units.\nManagement performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units. Based upon the results of the quantitative assessments, the Company concluded that the fair values of each of its reporting units, as of October 1, 2024, were greater than the carrying values. \nAlthough the Company believes that the current assumptions and estimates used in its goodwill analysis are reasonable, supportable, and appropriate, continued efforts to maintain or improve the performance of these businesses could be impacted \n57\nIndex\nby unfavorable or unforeseen changes which could impact the existing assumptions used in the impairment analysis. Various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably impact existing assumptions primarily delays in new customer bookings and the related delay in revenue from new customers, increases in customer termination activity, or increases in operating costs.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of the goodwill impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of future performance. It is possible that the Company’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2024 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2024 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. \nLegal Contingencies\nThe Company is involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation (including those described in more detail below), arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters include, but are not limited to, intellectual property disputes, commercial and contract disputes, professional liability claims, employee-related matters, transaction related disputes, securities and corporate law matters, and inquiries, including subpoenas and other civil investigative demands, from governmental agencies, Medicare or Medicaid payers and MCOs reviewing billing practices or requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. \nThe Company also is named from time to time in suits brought under the \nqui tam\n provisions of the False Claims Act and comparable state laws. These suits typically allege that the Company has made false statements and/or certifications in connection with claims for payment from U.S. federal or state healthcare programs. The suits may remain under seal (hence, unknown to the Company) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the \nqui tam\n plaintiff. Such claims are an inevitable part of doing business in the healthcare field today.\nThe Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its commercial laboratory operations and drug development support services. The healthcare diagnostics and drug development industries are, however, subject to extensive regulation, and the courts have not interpreted many of the applicable statutes and regulations. Therefore, the applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, additional liabilities from third-party claims, and/or exclusion from participation in government programs.\nThe Company records an aggregate legal reserve, which is determined using calculations based on historical loss rates and assessment of trends experienced in settlements and defense costs. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450 “Contingencies,” the Company establishes reserves for judicial, regulatory, and arbitration matters outside the aggregate legal reserve if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable and would exceed the aggregate legal reserve. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.
