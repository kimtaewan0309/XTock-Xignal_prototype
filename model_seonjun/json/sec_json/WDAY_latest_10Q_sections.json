MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nOverview\nWorkday is the enterprise artificial intelligence (“AI”) platform for managing people, money, and agents. We deliver cloud-based, AI-powered applications for financial management, human capital management (“HCM”), planning, spend management, and analytics. Our diverse customer base includes emerging, medium-sized, and large global organizations within numerous industries, including professional and business services, financial services, healthcare, education, government, technology, media, retail, and hospitality. Workday helps customers deliver better employee experiences, increase productivity, improve operational efficiencies, and provide insights for faster, data-driven decision-making.\nWe have achieved significant growth since our inception in 2005, when we pioneered HCM in the cloud. As a result of our innovation and commitment to customer success, today we are a Fortune 500 company with more than 11,000 customers around the world. As we continue to grow, we are focused on driving sustainable, long-term subscription revenue growth by adding new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers through increased adoption of our suite of solutions. Central to this effort is investing in strategic growth areas including developing innovative AI solutions, expanding internationally, growing our partner ecosystem, deepening our presence in industry verticals and the emerging and medium enterprise market, and exploring strategic acquisitions to complement our organic innovation. Our investments across these targeted growth areas may require additional costs, but we remain committed to optimizing resource allocation and realizing a return on our investments. Over time, we believe these investments will support revenue growth and a more scalable business.\nWe are focused on expanding our operating margin by driving scale and building efficiencies across the business through investments in people, processes, and systems. As a result of our focus on expanding operating margin, we expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease over the longer term as we grow our revenues and invest in a disciplined manner to support our long-term growth objectives.\n In February 2025, we announced a restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2026 Restructuring Plan”), which was intended to prioritize our investments and continue advancing our ongoing focus on durable growth. The plan resulted in the reduction of approximately 7.5% of our workforce. In connection with this plan, we exited certain owned office space. \n27\nTable o\nf Contents \nImpact of Current Economic Conditions\nRecent macroeconomic events including increased tariffs, elevated inflation, and fluctuating interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as geopolitical instability, continue to impact the global economy and create uncertainty, volatility, and disruption of financial markets. We remain confident in the long-term overall health of our business, the strength of our product offerings, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy and help our customers on their human capital and finance digital transformation journeys. Demand for our products remains strong, we continue to achieve solid new subscription bookings, and our near-term revenues are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, a moderation of revenue growth rates due to deal scrutiny and the lengthening of certain sales cycles, particularly within net new opportunities, and reduced growth in headcount level commitments upon renewals of existing customers. Further, we have provided, and may continue to provide, certain customers with more flexible payment terms. If the economic uncertainty continues, we may also experience additional negative impacts on customer renewals, customer collections, sales and marketing efforts, customer deployments, product development, or other financial metrics. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. For further discussion of the potential impacts of recent macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see “Risk Factors” included in Part II, Item 1A of this report.\nFinancial Results Overview\nThe following table provides an overview of our key metrics (in millions, except percentages, basis points, and headcount data):\n \nThree Months Ended October 31, \nNine Months Ended October 31, \n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nTotal revenues\n$\n2,432 \n$\n2,160 \n13 \n%\n$\n7,020 \n$\n6,235 \n13 \n%\nSubscription services revenues\n$\n2,244 \n$\n1,959 \n15 \n%\n$\n6,473 \n$\n5,678 \n14 \n%\nGAAP operating income\n$\n259 \n$\n165 \n57 \n%\n$\n547 \n$\n340 \n61 \n%\nNon-GAAP operating income \n(1)\n$\n692 \n$\n569 \n22 \n%\n$\n2,050 \n$\n1,602 \n28 \n%\nGAAP operating margin\n10.7 \n%\n7.6 \n%\n301 bps\n7.8 \n%\n5.5 \n%\n233 bps\nNon-GAAP operating margin \n(1)\n28.5 \n%\n26.3 \n%\n215 bps\n29.2 \n%\n25.7 \n%\n352 bps\nOperating cash flows\n$\n1,661 \n$\n1,349 \n23 \n%\nFree cash flows \n(1)\n$\n1,559 \n$\n1,166 \n34 \n%\nAs of October 31, \n2025\n2024\nChange\nTotal subscription revenue backlog\n$\n25,963 \n$\n22,191 \n17 \n%\n12-month subscription revenue backlog\n$\n8,206 \n$\n6,975 \n18 \n%\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n$\n6,843 \n$\n7,157 \n(4)\n%\nHeadcount\n20,588 \n20,493 \n0 \n%\n(1)\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.\n28\nTable o\nf Contents \nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services revenues include fees for deployment services, optimization services, and training.\nSubscription services revenues accounted for approximately 92% of our total revenues for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, and represented 97% of our total unearned revenue as of October 31, 2025. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications.\nThe mix of applications to which each customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.\nSubscription services revenues are recognized over time as services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally noncancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance for subscription services. We may provide certain customers flexible payment terms and the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers.\nOur professional services consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials or fixed price basis. We generally invoice our customers in arrears for our professional services. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenues are recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenues are recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect these partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers for services engagements.\nSubscription Revenue Backlog\nOur subscription revenue backlog, which is also referred to as remaining performance obligations for subscription contracts, represents contracted subscription services revenues that have not yet been recognized and includes billed and unbilled amounts. Subscription revenue backlog may fluctuate from period-to-period due to a number of factors, including the timing of renewals and overall renewal rates, new business growth, average contract duration, business combinations, and seasonality.\nCosts and Expenses\nCosts of subscription services revenues.\n Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of expenses associated with hosting our applications, providing standard customer support, and delivering enhanced customer support services. These costs include employee-related expenses, expenses related to data center capacity and third-party hosted infrastructure, and depreciation of our data center equipment.\nCosts of professional services revenues\n. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, subcontractor expenses, and travel expenses.\nProduct development expenses\n. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with our efforts to add new features and applications, increase functionality, and enhance the ease of use of our cloud applications, as well as expenses related to third-party hosted infrastructure.\nSales and marketing expenses.\n Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand awareness, brand ambassador campaigns, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new revenue contracts are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and information systems personnel, as well as professional services fees and other corporate expenses.\n29\nTable o\nf Contents \nRestructuring expenses.\n Restructuring expenses are associated with a formal restructuring program and consist of charges related to workforce reductions, including employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and share-based compensation, as well as charges associated with the closure of facilities and other exit and disposal activities.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nOur total revenues were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\n \nThree Months Ended October 31, \n \nNine Months Ended October 31, \n \n \n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nSubscription services\n$\n2,244 \n$\n1,959 \n15 \n%\n$\n6,473 \n$\n5,678 \n14 \n%\nProfessional services\n188 \n201 \n(7)\n%\n547 \n557 \n(2)\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n2,432 \n$\n2,160 \n13 \n%\n$\n7,020 \n$\n6,235 \n13 \n%\nTotal revenues were $2.4 billion for the three months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year period, an increase of $272 million, or 13%. Subscription services revenues were $2.2 billion for the three months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period, an increase of $286 million, or 15%. Approximately 60% of the increase in subscription services revenues was attributable to expansion within our customers that existed as of the beginning of the comparable prior year period, and the remaining 40% was attributable to customers added after the beginning of the comparable prior year period. Professional services revenues were $188 million for the three months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $201 million for the prior year period, a decrease of $14 million, or 7%. Professional services revenues decreased due to variation in project size and mix of deployment and integration services provided as we continue to expand and leverage our service partners.\nTotal revenues were $7.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $6.2 billion for the prior year period, an increase of $785 million, or 13%. Subscription services revenues were $6.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $5.7 billion for the prior year period, an increase of $795 million, or 14%. Approximately 60% of the increase in subscription services revenues was attributable to expansion within our customers that existed as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year, and the remaining 40% was attributable to customers added after the beginning of the prior fiscal year. Professional services revenues were $547 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $557 million for the prior year period, a decrease of $10 million, or 2%. Professional services revenues decreased due to variation in project size and mix of deployment and integration services provided as we continue to expand and leverage our service partners.\nGross Revenue Retention Rate\nOur growth in subscription services revenues attributable to existing customers is further reflected by our gross revenue retention rate of approximately 97% as of October 31, 2025. Our gross revenue retention rate measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers and is calculated by taking total annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) of our customers as of the corresponding prior period-end and comparing that to ARR from that same set of customers as of the current period-end. The metric takes into account recurring revenues lost to product or customer churn but does not account for additional revenue earned from add-ons or net expansions, which include volume and price adjustments. Our high gross revenue retention rate demonstrates our ability to maintain our existing customer base and drive strong overall customer satisfaction.\nOur gross revenue retention rate is based on ARR, which represents the annualized value of active subscription contracts as of the end of each period. Each subscription contract is annualized by dividing the total contract value by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365. We exclude certain subscription contracts from the calculation, including contracts with terms less than one year that are distinct from our core product offering, such as contracts for tenants which are used for implementation and testing. To the extent that we are negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, ARR is only adjusted if the customer churns. We calculate ARR on a constant currency basis using exchange rates set at the beginning of each fiscal year. ARR is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed independently of, and not as a substitute for or combined with, revenue and unearned revenue.\n30\nTable o\nf Contents \nSubscription Revenue Backlog\nAs of October 31, 2025, our total subscription revenue backlog was $26.0 billion, with $8.2 billion expected to be recognized in revenues over the next 12 months. As of October 31, 2024, our total subscription revenue backlog was $22.2 billion, with $7.0 billion expected to be recognized in revenues over the next 12 months. The increase in subscription revenue backlog was primarily driven by expansion within our existing customer base, sales to new customers, and timing of renewals for existing customers.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses were as follows (in millions):\n \nThree Months Ended October 31, \nNine Months Ended October 31, \n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nCosts of subscription services\n$\n395 \n$\n329 \n$\n1,115 \n$\n924 \nCosts of professional services\n196 \n201 \n595 \n606 \nProduct development\n666 \n647 \n1,988 \n1,952 \nSales and marketing\n677 \n620 \n1,941 \n1,804 \nGeneral and administrative\n234 \n198 \n662 \n600 \nRestructuring\n5 \n0 \n172 \n9 \nTotal costs and expenses\n$\n2,173 \n$\n1,995 \n$\n6,473 \n$\n5,895 \nTotal costs and expenses were $2.2 billion for the three months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period, an increase of $178 million, or 9%.

The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $96 million in third-party hosted infrastructure expenses, $57 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to delivering our enhanced customer support services, net of restructuring-related cost savings, and $27 million in facilities and IT-related expenses.\nWe expect costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our technical operations infrastructure, including third-party hosted infrastructure, and as we grow our enhanced customer support services.\nCosts of Professional Services\nCosts of professional services were $196 million for the three months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $201 million for the prior year period, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%. Costs of professional services remained relatively flat as a result of restructuring-related cost savings that reduced employee-related expenses.\n31\nTable o\nf Contents \nCosts of professional services were $595 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $606 million for the prior year period, a decrease of $11 million, or 2%. The decrease in costs of professional services included a reduction of $15 million in subcontractor expenses. Employee-related expenses remained relatively flat as a result of restructuring-related cost savings.\nWe expect costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we expand and leverage our service partners to deploy our applications and focus on growing our subscription revenues.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses were $666 million for the three months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $647 million for the prior year period, an increase of $19 million, or 3%.

The 2025 Tax Act makes permanent key elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic research cost expensing, and modifications to the international tax framework. The 2025 Tax Act did not have a material impact on our annual effective tax rate and is expected to reduce our domestic cash tax outflows for the remainder of fiscal 2026. Due to the complexity and various upcoming effective dates of the 2025 Tax Act, we are still in the process of assessing its impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. The final impact may differ from our current estimates based on further analysis, regulatory guidance, and any legislative changes.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15% global minimum tax for large multinational corporations. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation, with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected in the near future. Pillar Two rules are at varying stages of adoption across the jurisdictions where we operate. The specific rules and timeline to implement these rules vary by jurisdiction. The adoption of Pillar Two rules may affect our effective tax rate and current tax obligations and liabilities. While we do not currently anticipate Pillar Two rules to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results, we are monitoring developments from the OECD, governmental bodies, such as the EU, and intergovernmental economic organizations, to evaluate the impact of changing global tax laws.\nFor further information, see \nNote 17, Income Taxes\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of October 31, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $6.8 billion, which were primarily held for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are primarily composed of, in order from largest to smallest, money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, asset-backed securities, supranational securities, and commercial paper. We have financed our operations primarily through customer payments, issuance of debt, and sales of our common stock.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to the remaining term of contracted noncancelable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our 2022 Credit Agreement that provides for $1.0 billion of unsecured financing, are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, planned acquisition, share repurchase, and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months and beyond.\nOur long-term future capital requirements depend on many factors, including the effects of macroeconomic trends, customer growth rates, subscription renewal activity, headcount growth, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, infrastructure development, and our investment and acquisition activities. As part of our strategy, we may choose to seek additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Additionally, our cash provided by operating activities could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including the “Risk Factors” included in Part II, Item 1A of this report.\nOur cash flows were as follows (in millions):\n \nNine Months Ended October 31, \n \n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n1,661 \n$\n1,349 \nInvesting activities\n1,177 \n(1,054)\nFinancing activities\n(1,775)\n(996)\nEffect of exchange rate changes\n1 \n0 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n1,064 \n$\n(701)\n35\nTable o\nf Contents \nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher cash collections of $767 million mainly due to increased sales, partially offset by increased supplier payments of $249 million to support our continued growth and increased employee-related payments of $211 million, which include payments made under the Fiscal 2026 Restructuring Plan.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, which primarily resulted from net inflows of $2.3 billion as we converted marketable debt securities into cash to fund acquisition activities and share repurchases, offset by net outflows of $974 million for acquisitions, and capital expenditures of $102 million mainly for office space projects.\nCash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, which primarily resulted from net outflows of $824 million for acquisitions, capital expenditures of $183 million for data center and office space projects, and net outflows of $39 million related to marketable debt securities.\nWe expect capital expenditures will be approximately $200 million in fiscal 2026. This primarily includes investments in our office facilities to support our continued growth.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $1.8 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, which primarily resulted from repurchases of common stock of $1.4 billion under our share repurchase programs and taxes paid of $495 million related to net share settlement of equity awards, offset by proceeds of $111 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.\nCash used in financing activities was $996 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, which was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $597 million under our share repurchase programs and taxes paid of $505 million related to net share settlement of equity awards, offset by proceeds of $106 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.\nFree Cash Flows\nIn evaluating our performance internally, we focus on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. We define free cash flows, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.\nFree cash flows were $1.6 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period. The improvement was primarily the result of higher cash collections of $767 million mainly due to increased sales and decreased capital expenditures of $81 million, partially offset by increased supplier payments of $249 million to support our continued growth and increased employee-related payments of $211 million, which include payments made under the Fiscal 2026 Restructuring Plan.\nReconciliation of our GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flows is as follows (in millions):\n \nNine Months Ended October 31, \n \n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,661 \n$\n1,349 \nLess: Capital expenditures\n(102)\n(183)\nFree cash flows\n$\n1,559 \n$\n1,166 \n36\nTable o\nf Contents \nShare Repurchase Programs\nWe repurchase shares of our Class A common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Under these programs, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions, we may repurchase shares of our Class A common stock through open market purchases, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means. The timing and total amount of share repurchases will depend upon business, economic, and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, and other considerations. The share repurchase programs have no expiration date, may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and do not obligate us to acquire any amount of Class A common stock.\nShare repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors that were active during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, and 2024, were as follows (in millions):\nAuthorization Date\nAmount Authorized\nAuthorization Completion Date\nNovember 2022\n$\n500 \nQ1 fiscal 2025\nFebruary 2024\n500 \nQ3 fiscal 2025\nAugust 2024\n1,000 \nQ3 fiscal 2026\nMay 2025\n1,000 \nSeptember 2025\n4,000 \nAs of October 31, 2025, we were authorized to repurchase a remaining $4.4 billion of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock under our share repurchase programs.\nFor further information, see \nNote 14, \nStockholders\n’ Equity\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations primarily consist of borrowings under our Senior Notes, agreements for third-party hosted infrastructure platforms for business operations, leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity, and other purchase obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, except as discussed below.\nIn July 2025, a 20-year lease for our new European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, commenced, resulting in an operating lease liability of $333 million. For further information, see \nNote 1\n2, Leases\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nIn November 2025, we completed our acquisition of Sana Labs AB (“Sana”) for approximately $1.0 billion in cash. For further information, see \nNote 21, Subsequent Events\n, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flows meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business.\nOur non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin exclude the components listed below. For the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding these components provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.\n37\nTable o\nf Contents \n•\nShare-based compensation expense. \nShare-based compensation primarily consists of non-cash expenses for employee restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, this expense is determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates, that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expense is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients.\n•\nEmployer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. \nWe exclude the employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions in order to show the full effect that excluding share-based compensation expense has on our operating results. Similar to share-based compensation expense, this tax expense is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of our business.\n•\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.\n For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of the related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe this activity is reflective of our ongoing operations. Although we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n•\nAcquisition-related costs.\n Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs, such as due diligence and advisory fees, and certain compensation and integration-related expenses. We exclude the effects of acquisition-related costs as we believe these transaction-specific expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and do not correlate to the operation of our business.\n•\nRestructuring costs. \nRestructuring costs are associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to workforce reductions, the closure of facilities, and other exit and disposal activities. We exclude these expenses because they are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\nFree Cash Flows\nWe define free cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We use free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business, as it balances operating results, cash management, and capital efficiency. We believe information regarding free cash flows provides investors and others with an enhanced view of cash flow generation from the ongoing operations of our business.\nLimitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations as they do not reflect all items of expense or cash that affect our operations and are reflected in the corresponding GAAP financial measures. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position.\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nSee “Results of Operations—Operating Income and Operating Margin” for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin, to the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, and 2024.\nSee “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flows” for a reconciliation from the most comparable GAAP financial measure, net cash provided by operating activities, to the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flows, for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, and 2024.\n38\nTable o\nf Contents \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity, and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and operating results:\n•\nRevenue recognition\n•\nDeferred commissions\n•\nIncome taxes\n•\nBusiness combinations, goodwill, and acquisition-related intangible assets\nFor a further discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. During the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.\n39\nTable o\nf Contents"
