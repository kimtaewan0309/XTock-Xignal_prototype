In some territories, certain films may be exclusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal year 2026, we expect to release approximately 20 films. \nThe Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the public’s intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets. These costs are expensed as incurred, which may result in a loss on the theatrical distribution of a film, including in periods prior to the release of the film.\nTV/VOD Distribution\nWe license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\nHome Entertainment Distribution\nThe Company’s film and episodic content is sold in both electronic (home video license and video-on-demand rentals) and physical formats.

The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties for use on third-party products in these categories and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products and often include minimum guarantee payments from the licensees.

The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\nAll of the Parks & Experiences businesses are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and direct-to-consumer programming.\nINDIA JOINT VENTURE\nOn November 14, 2024, the Company and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) formed a joint venture (the India joint venture) that combined the Company’s Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and Disney+ Hotstar direct-to-consumer service in India (Star India) with certain media and entertainment businesses controlled by \n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRIL (the Star India Transaction). The Company owns 37% of the India joint venture and recognizes its share of the joint venture’s results in “Equity in the income of investees” in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. Star India results through November 14, 2024 were consolidated in the Company’s financial results. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nThe Company seeks to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. The Company’s human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit and perquisite programs; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company and evolve and invest in technology, tools and resources to enable employees at work.\nThe Company employed approximately 231,000 people as of fiscal year end 2025, of which approximately 172,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 59,000 were employed outside the U.S. Our global workforce comprises approximately 76% full-time and 16% part-time employees, with another 8% being seasonal employees.

Risks related to the protection and exploitation of IP rights and information concerning the expiration of certain of our copyrights are set forth in Item 1A – Risk Factors.\nREGULATION\nFederal Communications Commission Regulation\nTelevision broadcasting is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect linear channels include the following:\n•\nLicensing of television stations\n. Each of the television stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (and the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future.\n•\nStation ownership limits\n. The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations an entity can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations an entity can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations. Currently:\n◦\nFCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any market.\n◦\nFederal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience. Pursuant to the most recent decision by the FCC as to how to calculate compliance with this limit, our eight stations reach approximately 20% of the national audience.\n•\nDual networks\n. FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC — from being under common ownership or control.\n•\nForeign ownership\n. The Communications Act generally restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of the voting or equity interest in a U.S. entity that controls a broadcast television licensee. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. \n•\nRegulation of programming\n. The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning “indecent” programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during children’s programming. Penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over $400,000 per indecent utterance or image per station.\nFederal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast stations are generally required to provide an average of three hours per week of programming that has as a “significant purpose” meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance.\n•\nCable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations.\n With respect to MVPDs operating within a television station’s Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either “must carry” status, pursuant to which MVPDs generally must carry a local television station in the station’s market, or “retransmission consent” status, pursuant to which the MVPDs must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. The ABC owned television stations have historically elected retransmission consent.\n•\nCable and satellite carriage of programming.\n The Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations between programmers and distributors regarding the carriage of networks by cable and satellite distribution companies, and some cable and satellite distribution companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on their systems. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could have an impact on the Company’s operations.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, other legislation and specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCC’s regulatory authority.\nFCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.\nPrivacy and Data Protection Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to various privacy and data protection laws and regulations in most of the domestic and international jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Those laws and regulations govern our use, collection, storage, retention and sharing of personal information and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including within the U.S. at the federal level and among the 50 states. This patchwork of domestic and international laws creates different obligations that are, at times, inconsistent with one another.\nWhile there is no comprehensive privacy law in the U.S. at the federal level, there are a number of sector-specific federal privacy laws applicable to our operations, such as the Video Privacy Protection Act, which restricts the ability to share personal information along with specific viewing information with third parties. In addition, various U.S. states, including California, have passed comprehensive data privacy laws that establish various consumer rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information with third parties, to gain access to the personal information that companies hold about them, to delete personal information and to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive information. We are also subject to privacy legal and regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions outside the United States, including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and similar comprehensive data privacy legislation in the UK. These laws require organizations that process the personal data of EU and UK citizens to comply with certain data protection standards and privacy rights, including requirements to implement privacy by design; parental consent for processing children’s data; detailed privacy notices and related consents; breach notifications; and data subject rights to enforce access, rectification, objection, restriction, portability and deletion.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that are intended to protect the privacy of children online, including the Children’s Online Protection Privacy Act, a U.S. federal law that requires websites and online services to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13, as well as codes of conduct relating to the design of digital products and services likely to be accessed by children, such as the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code. These laws, regulations and codes of conduct have an impact on the marketing of our products and services, the advertising on certain of our and third-party digital platforms that distribute our content and the design of certain of our new media offerings.\nIn addition, U.S. state laws and many international data protection laws require notifications to consumers and regulators in the event of a data breach, mandating that businesses provide consumers and/or government agencies notice of unauthorized access or disclosure of certain information.\nInterpretation of privacy and data protection laws and enforcement priorities continue to evolve and in some cases, regulators seek to apply novel interpretations of existing laws.\nCompliance with privacy and data protection laws and regulations entails significant investments and is costly and requires us to employ dedicated compliance personnel and processes. In addition, many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, private rights of action for damages and other relief.\nInternational Content Regulation\nThe laws and regulations in many international jurisdictions in which we operate require our linear networks or our DTC streaming services to include a certain amount of programming produced in specific jurisdictions or languages or require us to invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content or to acquire content produced by local independent production companies. In addition, some countries regulate the content of films and television programming, which can impact our ability to distribute certain content in those jurisdictions or can require us to make adjustments to the films or programming. These laws and regulations increase our costs and impact the way we operate our DTC streaming services and linear networks and the distribution of our films and programming in these markets.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWe also use our Investor Relations website as a means of disclosing material non-public information.

It includes the following sections:\n•\nConsolidated Results and Non-Segment Items\n•\nBusiness Segment Results \n•\nCorporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nTrends and Uncertainties\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n•\nEntertainment DTC Product Descriptions and Key Definitions\n•\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nIn Item 7, we discuss fiscal 2025 and 2024 results and comparisons of fiscal 2025 results to fiscal 2024 results. Discussions of fiscal 2023 results and comparisons of fiscal 2024 results to fiscal 2023 results can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in \nPart II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K\n for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024.\nStar India\nOn November 14, 2024, the Company and RIL completed the Star India Transaction (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company recognizes its 37% share of the India joint venture’s results in “Equity in the income of investees.” Star India results through November 14, 2024 were consolidated in the Company’s financial results and reported in the Entertainment and Sports segments.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMS\nRevenues for fiscal 2025 increased 3%, or $3.1 billion, to $94.4 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased $7.4 billion to income of $12.4 billion compared to $5.0 billion in the prior year; and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to Disney increased to $6.85 compared to $2.72 in the prior year. The net income and EPS increases were due to a lower effective tax rate in the current year compared to the prior year and the comparison to impairments related to the Star India Transaction and goodwill in the prior year. In addition, the increases in net income and EPS were due to higher operating income at Entertainment and Experiences. The lower effective tax rate was due to a non-cash tax benefit recognized in the current year upon a change in Hulu’s U.S. income tax classification (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nRevenues\nService revenues for fiscal 2025 increased 3%, or $2.7 billion, to $84.6 billion, which included an approximate 3 percentage point decrease from the Star India Transaction. Aside from this impact, service revenues increased due to higher subscription revenue, growth at our parks and experiences businesses and an increase in content sales.\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2025 increased 3%, or $0.3 billion, to $9.8 billion, driven by growth at our parks and experiences businesses, partially offset by lower physical home entertainment distribution revenue due to a shift to licensing of physical distribution rights to third parties.\nCosts and expenses\nCost of services for fiscal 2025 increased $0.2 billion to $52.7 billion, which included an approximate 4 percentage point decrease from the Star India Transaction. Aside from this impact, cost of services increased due to higher programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, the impact of inflation at our parks and experiences businesses.\nCost of products for fiscal 2025 decreased 2%, or $0.1 billion to $6.1 billion, due to a shift to licensing of physical home entertainment distribution, partially offset by the impact of inflation at our theme parks and resorts.\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2025 increased 5%, or $0.7 billion, to $16.5 billion, which included approximately 2 percentage point decrease from the Star India Transaction. Aside from this impact, selling, general, administrative and other costs increased driven by higher marketing costs.\nDepreciation and amortization for fiscal 2025 increased 7%, or $0.3 billion, to $5.3 billion primarily due to higher depreciation at our parks and experiences businesses.\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\n($ in millions)\n2025\n2024\nImpairments:\nEquity investments\n(1)\n$\n635\n \n$\n165 \nContent\n(2)\n109\n \n187 \nStar India\n143\n \n1,545 \nGoodwill\n(3)\n—\n \n1,287 \nRetail assets\n—\n \n328 \nSeverance\n—\n \n83 \nOther\n(68)\n—\n \n$\n819\n \n$\n3,595 \n(1)\nPrimarily related to A+E (fiscal 2025 and 2024) and Tata Play Limited (fiscal 2025).\n(2)\nRelated to strategic changes in our approach to content curation.\n(3)\nRelated to general entertainment linear networks.\nOther expense\nIn the prior year, the Company recorded a charge of $65 million related to a legal ruling.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInterest Expense, net\n($ in millions)\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nBetter (Worse)\nInterest expense\n$\n(\n1,812\n)\n  \n$\n(\n2,070\n)\n  \n12  %\nInterest income, investment income and other\n507\n \n810 \n(37) %\nInterest expense, net\n$\n(1,305)\n  \n$\n(1,260)\n  \n(4) %\nThe decrease in interest expense was due to lower average rates and debt balances, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest.\nThe decrease in interest income, investment income and other was driven by a lower benefit from pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost, and the impact of lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and lower average rates.\nEquity in the Income of Investees\nEquity in the income of investees decreased $280 million to $\n295\n million in the current year from $\n575\n million in the prior year due to losses from the India joint venture in the current year and lower income from A+E. \nEffective Income Tax Rate\n($ in millions)\n2025\n2024\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n12,003\n \n     \n$\n7,569 \n    \nIncome tax expense \n(1,428)\n     \n1,796 \n    \nEffective income tax rate\n(11.9)\n%\n23.7%\nThe effective income tax rate was negative 11.9% in the current year compared to a positive effective income tax rate of 23.7% in the prior year.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\nEntertainment\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three lines of business: \n•\nLinear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n•\nContent Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical market, sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment. \nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment consist of the following:\n•\nProgramming and production costs, which include:\n•\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and the costs of licensed programming rights\n•\nSubscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live TV service, including fees paid by Hulu to ESPN and the Entertainment linear networks business for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live TV\n•\nProduction costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n•\nParticipations and residual expenses\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n•\nFees paid to ESPN to program certain sports content on ABC Network and Disney+\n•\nOther operating expenses, which include technology support costs and distribution costs\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and costs of licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment’s businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the business of initial exploitation. Certain other costs, such as technology, shared services and certain labor related costs, are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption.\nSports\nThe Sports segment primarily generates revenue from affiliate and subscription fees, advertising, pay-per-view fees and sub-licensing of sports rights. Operating expenses consist of programming and production costs and other operating expenses. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs related to live sports and other sports-related programming. Other operating expenses include technology support costs and distribution costs. \nExperiences\nThe Experiences segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of tickets for admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties earned on Tokyo Disney Resort revenues. Expenses consist of operating labor, infrastructure costs, costs of goods sold and distribution costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include technology support costs, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation.

Tax payments in the prior year reflected the payment of fiscal 2023 U.S. federal and California state income taxes that had been deferred pursuant to relief related to 2023 winter storms in California. In addition, payments for fiscal 2025 U.S. federal and California state income tax liabilities were deferred until October 2025 pursuant to relief related to the 2025 wildfires in California.

The projected increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to higher spending at Experiences, attributable to theme park and resort expansion and new attractions, partially offset by lower spending on cruise ship fleet expansion.\nOther Investing Activities\nCash used in other investing activities was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024 reflecting an investment in Epic Games, Inc. \nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities for fiscal 2025 and 2024 are as follows:\n($ in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange in borrowings\n$\n(3,621)\n$\n(1,400)\nDividends\n(\n1,803\n)\n(\n1,366\n)\nRepurchases of common stock\n(\n3,500\n)\n(\n2,992\n)\nActivities related to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests\n(1)\n(1,032)\n(9,156)\nCash used in other financing activities, net\n(2)\n(410)\n(374)\nCash used in financing activities\n$\n(10,366)\n \n$\n(15,288)\n \n(1)   \nActivities related to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the current year were due to $0.6 billion of dividend payments to noncontrolling interest holders and $0.4 billion related to an incremental amount paid by the Company for Hulu based on the final appraisal of Hulu’s fair value.

The Company may use cash balances, operating cash flows, commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities and incremental term debt issuances to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2025 and 2024. On November 13, 2025, the Company declared a dividend of $1.50 per share (or approximately $2.6 billion), payable in two semi-annual installments of $0.75 per share on January 15, 2026 and July 22, 2026. The Company is targeting a total of $7 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2026.\nThe redeemable noncontrolling interest activity in the current and prior year was attributable to the acquisition of NBCU’s interest in Hulu. In June 2025, the Company paid an incremental amount for Hulu based on a final appraisal of Hulu’s fair value (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as raising additional financing, reducing or not declaring future dividends; reducing or stopping share repurchases; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing further cost-saving initiatives.\nThe Company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of September 27, 2025, Moody’s Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, and S&P Global Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1 (Stable). On September 29, 2025, Fitch Ratings’ affirmed the long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company of A- and F2 (Stable), respectively, withdrew the debt ratings for commercial reasons and will no longer provide ratings for the Company. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 27, 2025, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nTo drive growth at our sports and entertainment businesses, we are, among other things, making strategic investments in our DTC offerings. Although there can be no assurances these investments will be successful, we expect that they will lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers and the related decrease in average viewership, which we expect will continue.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, the future effects of evolving macroeconomic, trade and travel conditions, including as a result of evolving international political developments, trade policies and consumer spending dynamics are unknown and, depending on how these conditions develop, could adversely affect demand for and availability of our products and services, increase our costs to provide products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. \nSee also Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProduced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs\nWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).\nWith respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\nWith respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.\nUltimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.\nProduction costs classified as individual are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title’s unamortized costs to the present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the extent the title’s unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.\nProduced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Historical viewing patterns are the most significant input into determining the projected usage, and significant judgment is required in using historical viewing patterns to derive projected usage. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.\nCost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the group may be less than its unamortized costs by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\nThe amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value). Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated \n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrelative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions\nThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 5.45% at the end of fiscal 2025 from \n5.06\n% at the end of fiscal 2024 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2025 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2026 by approximately $0.1 billion and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 27, 2025 by approximately $2.1 billion. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have a negligible impact on total benefit expense and decrease the projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.9 billion.\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.25%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2026 annual expense by approximately $\n177\n million.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. \nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. \nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, determining whether reporting units should be aggregated, the assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate to determine the fair value of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Discount rates are determined based on the inherent risks of the underlying operations.\nSignificant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our businesses. Changes to these assumptions and shifts in market trends or macroeconomic events could impact test results in the future. \n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn fiscal 2025, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.\nAs discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in fiscal 2024, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 billion related to our entertainment linear networks reporting unit. \nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. \nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows. \nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.1 billion and $1.5 billion related to the Star India Transaction in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, to reflect Star India at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. \nThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. \nThe Company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The fiscal 2025 charges related to impairments of equity investments and content assets. The fiscal 2024 charges related to impairments of retail assets, content assets and equity investments. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our \n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nassumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on litigation exposure.\nIncome Tax\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\nENTERTAINMENT DTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS AND  KEY DEFINITIONS \nEntertainment DTC Product Offerings\nIn the U.S., Disney+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as part of various bundled offerings, which may include one of the ESPN DTC plans. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN Select. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.  \nPaid Subscribers for Entertainment DTC services\nPaid subscribers for Entertainment DTC services reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to bundled offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the bundled offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD and Disney+ services. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our Entertainment DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.\nInternational Disney+\nInternational Disney+ includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada.\nAverage Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber for Entertainment DTC services\nHulu average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN Select bundled offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.\nSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOn March 20, 2019, as part of the acquisition of TFCF, The Walt Disney Company (“TWDC”) became the ultimate parent of TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (“Legacy Disney”). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as “Obligor Group”, and individually, as a “Guarantor”. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF’s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the “exchange notes”) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “TWDC Indenture”) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November \n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “2001 Trustee”) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).\nOther subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “non-Guarantors”). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at September 27, 2025 was as follows:\nTWDC\nLegacy Disney\n($ in millions)\nPar Value\nCarrying Value\nPar Value\nCarrying Value\nRegistered debt with unconditional guarantee\n$\n30,395 \n \n$\n31,231 \n \n$\n6,450 \n \n$\n6,387 \n \nThe guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities.\nOperations are conducted almost entirely through the Company’s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.\nSet forth below are summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nResults of operations ($ in millions)\n2025\nRevenues\n$\n— \n  \nCosts and expenses\n— \n  \nNet income (loss)\n(2,703)\n  \nNet income (loss) attributable to TWDC shareholders\n(2,703)\n  \nBalance Sheet ($ in millions)\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nCurrent assets\n$\n2,295 \n$\n2,767 \nNoncurrent assets\n3,613 \n3,336 \nCurrent liabilities\n9,592 \n7,640 \nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding intercompany to non-Guarantors)\n36,314 \n40,608 \nIntercompany payables to non-Guarantors\n167,091 \n157,925",
