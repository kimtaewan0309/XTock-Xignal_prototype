We are a leading midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage and marine export services.  As one of the largest diversified energy infrastructure companies in North America, we are delivering energy that makes a difference in the lives of people in the U.S. and around the world.  Through our now approximately 60,000-mile pipeline network, we transport the natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil that help meet domestic and international energy demand, contribute to energy security and provide safe, reliable and responsible energy solutions needed today and into the future.\nMidstream Value Chain\nThe midstream value chain is a vital part of the energy industry.  After crude oil and natural gas are produced from upstream wells, we use our extensive infrastructure to process and transport these raw materials, readying them for end use.  For transportation of crude oil, natural gas, Refined Products and NGLs, pipelines are generally the most reliable, lowest cost, least carbon intensive and safest alternative for intermediate and long-haul movements between markets and end users.  \n6\nTable of Contents\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nEnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition\n - On Aug. 28, 2024, we entered into the EnLink Purchase Agreement with GIP to acquire GIP’s interest in EnLink consisting of approximately 43% of the outstanding EnLink Units for $14.90 in cash per unit and 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests in the managing member of EnLink for $300 million, for total cash consideration of $3.3 billion.  On Oct. 15, 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition.  We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.  This acquisition meaningfully increases our scale and integrated value chain within the growing Permian Basin while expanding and extending our asset bases in the Mid-Continent, North Texas and Louisiana regions.  We expect to achieve significant synergies by combining our complementary asset positions.  The operations of EnLink are reported across all four of our existing segments.\nEnLink Acquisition\n - On Nov. 24, 2024, we entered into the EnLink Merger Agreement to acquire all of the publicly held EnLink Units in an all stock, tax-free transaction.  On Jan. 31, 2025, we completed the EnLink Acquisition.  Pursuant to the EnLink Merger Agreement, each common unit of EnLink was exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock, including EnLink Units that were exchanged for all previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units immediately prior to closing.  We issued 41 million shares of common stock, with a fair value of $4.0 billion as of the closing date of the EnLink Acquisition.  EnLink is now a wholly owned subsidiary.\nFor additional information on the EnLink Acquisitions, see Part II, Item 8, Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  In addition, see Part 1, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of related risks.  \nMedallion Acquisition\n - On Aug. 28, 2024, we entered into the Medallion Purchase and Sale Agreement with GIP to acquire all of the equity interests in Medallion for a purchase price of $2.6 billion, subject to customary adjustments, and inclusive of the purchase of additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party.  On Oct. 31, 2024, we completed the Medallion Acquisition.  We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.  This acquisition expands our midstream services for crude oil and condensate in West Texas, specifically in the Midland Basin.  Medallion’s operations are reported in our Refined Products and Crude segment.\nFor additional information on the Medallion Acquisition, see Part II, Item 8, Note B, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  See Part 1, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks related to the Medallion Acquisition.\nJoint Ventures\n - On Feb. 4, 2025, we entered into definitive agreements to form joint ventures with MPLX LP (MPLX) to construct a 400 MBbl/d liquified petroleum gas export terminal in Texas City, Texas, and a new 24-inch pipeline from our Mont Belvieu, Texas, storage facility to the new terminal.  Texas City Logistics LLC, the export terminal joint venture, is owned 50% by us and 50% by MPLX, with MPLX constructing and operating the facility.  MBTC Pipeline LLC, the pipeline joint venture, is owned 80% by us and 20% by MPLX, and we will construct and operate the pipeline.  We expect to invest approximately $1.0 billion in these projects. \nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Divestiture\n - On Nov. 19, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with DT Midstream, Inc. to sell three of our wholly owned interstate natural gas pipeline systems for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion.  On Dec. 31, 2024, we completed the sale and recognized a gain of $227 million.  This transaction aligns and enhances our capital allocation priorities within our integrated value chain. \nGulf Coast NGL Pipelines Acquisition\n - In June 2024, we completed the acquisition of a system of NGL pipelines from Easton Energy, a Houston-based midstream company, for approximately $280 million.  This acquisition in our Natural Gas Liquids segment includes approximately 450 miles of liquids products pipelines located in the strategic Gulf Coast market centers for NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.  A portion of the Easton assets are connected to our Mont Belvieu assets.  We expect to add connections to our Houston-based assets beginning in mid-2025 through the end of 2025.\nBusiness Update and Market Conditions\n - Over the past year, we experienced significant growth across our value chain due to our recent acquisitions.  Earnings increased in 2024, compared with 2023, due primarily to a full year of earnings from the new Refined Products and Crude segment, higher NGL and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and the impact of the interstate pipeline divestiture in the Natural Gas Pipelines segment.  Our extensive and integrated assets are located in, and connected with, some of the most productive shale basins, as well as refineries and demand centers, in the United States.  Although the energy industry has experienced many commodity cycles, we have positioned ourselves to reduce \n7\nTable of Contents\nexposure to direct commodity price volatility.  Each of our four reportable segments are primarily fee-based, and our consolidated earnings were approximately 90% fee-based in 2024.  \nCapital Allocation\n - We continue to focus on maintaining prudent financial strength and flexibility.  In January 2025, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $1.03 per share, an increase of 4% compared with the same quarter in the prior year.  In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.  As of Dec. 31, 2024, we repurchased $172 million of our outstanding common shares under the program.  As of Dec. 31, 2024, we also had $733 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $2.5 billion of available capacity under our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement. \nSustainability and Social Responsibility\n - Through our participation in the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, we qualified for inclusion in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook for the fifth consecutive year, scoring within the top 15% of the Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation industry.  Additionally, in 2024, we received an MSCI ESG Rating of AAA, and our ESG Risk Rating, as assessed by Morningstar Sustainalytics, was in the top 20% of the refiners and pipelines industry.\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing\n - In our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, earnings increased in 2024, compared with 2023, due to higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, as well as the impact of the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition from the period of Oct. 15, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024. \nIn our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, we have a capital project to relocate a 150 MMcf/d processing plant to the Permian Basin from North Texas, which we expect to be in service in the first quarter of 2026. \nNGLs\n - In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, earnings decreased in 2024, compared with 2023, due primarily to the insurance settlement gain in 2023 related to the Medford incident, which was offset partially by higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and the impact of the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition from the period of Oct. 15, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024.  \nIn December 2024, we announced that we completed construction of our 125 MBbl/d MB-6 NGL fractionator and the looping of the West Texas NGL pipeline.  Additional pump stations, which are expected to be completed in mid-2025, will further increase system capacity to 740 MBbl/d, more than doubling our NGL capacity out of the Permian Basin.  In January 2025, we completed construction of our Elk Creek pipeline expansion project, which is partially in service.  Upon supply of full power, expected in mid-2025, we will have capacity of 435 MBbl/d to transport growing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, which will bring our total pipeline capacity out of the Rocky Mountain region to 575 MBbl/d.  \nIn August 2024, we announced plans to rebuild our 210 MBbl/d NGL fractionator in Medford, Oklahoma.  Rebuilding at Medford provides strategic benefits that include expansion options that will allow our integrated system to accommodate volume growth from the Permian Basin and the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions.  The Medford fractionator will also produce butane and natural gasoline for incremental Refined Products and diluent blending opportunities in the Mid-Continent region. \nNatural Gas Pipelines\n - In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, earnings increased in 2024, compared with 2023, due primarily to the impact of the interstate pipeline divestiture and increased transportation services, as well as the impact of the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition from the period of Oct. 15, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024.\nWe recently reactivated previously idled storage facilities with 3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity in Texas.  In addition, we are in the process of expanding our storage injection capabilities in Oklahoma, which we expect to be complete in the second quarter of 2025.  As a result of the EnLink Acquisitions, we have access to additional natural gas storage assets in Texas and Louisiana.  \nRefined Products and Crude\n - This reportable business segment was added in 2023 in conjunction with the Magellan Acquisition.  Our 2023 results include the impact of the Magellan Acquisition from the period of Sept. 25, 2023, to Dec. 31, 2023.  Earnings in this segment increased in 2024 due primarily to a full year of operating results following the Magellan Acquisition and due to the recent acquisitions of EnLink and Medallion.  Our 2024 results include the impact of the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition from the period of Oct. 15, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024, and the impact of the Medallion Acquisition from the period of Nov. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024.  In 2024, we benefited from mid-year tariff increases of Refined Products.  Additionally, our optimization and marketing earnings have remained strong due to favorable commodity market conditions. \n8\nTable of Contents\nAt the end of the first quarter 2024, we completed the expansion of our Refined Products pipeline to El Paso, Texas.  This expansion provides additional Refined Products supply to growing markets in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Mexico.\nIn July 2024, we announced plans to expand our Refined Products pipeline capacity, connecting Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast supply with the greater Denver area, to meet growing demand and increase connectivity with the Denver International Airport (DIA).  The project includes construction of a new 230-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline from Scott City, Kansas, to DIA and the addition or upgrading of certain pump stations along the existing Refined Products pipeline system.  Total system capacity will increase by 35 MBbl/d and will have additional expansion capabilities.  This project is fully subscribed under long-term contracts. \nSee Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report for more information on our capital projects, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nOur mission is to deliver energy products and services vital to an advancing world.

Most raw natural gas produced at the wellhead also contains a mixture of NGL components, including ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  Gathered wellhead natural gas is directed to our processing plants to remove NGLs resulting in residue natural gas (primarily methane). Residue natural gas is then recompressed and delivered to natural gas pipelines, storage facilities and end users.  The NGLs separated from the raw natural gas are delivered through NGL pipelines to fractionation facilities for further processing.  Some of the heavier NGLs may separate upstream of processing and fractionation and are sold as condensate at NGL or crude oil markets.  Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment provides these midstream services to producers in the regions listed below. \nRocky Mountain region\n - The Williston Basin is located in portions of North Dakota and Montana and includes the oil-producing, NGL-rich Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations.  We have more than 3 million dedicated acres in the Williston Basin.\nThe Powder River Basin is primarily located in Eastern Wyoming, which includes the NGL-rich Niobrara, Frontier, Turner and Mowry formations. \nMid-Continent region\n - The Mid-Continent region includes the natural gas and oil-producing Anadarko Basin, which includes the NGL-rich SCOOP and STACK areas, Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Meramec, Granite Wash, Cherokee and Mississippian Lime formations of Oklahoma.  We have more than 600,000 dedicated acres in the Anadarko Basin, excluding EnLink.  As a result of the EnLink Acquisitions, we have more than doubled our presence in the Mid-Continent region by expanding our existing presence in the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale and STACK area, while also beginning to operate in the Arkoma-Woodford Shale.  \nPermian Basin region\n - The Permian Basin is a large, natural gas-rich sedimentary basin composed of the Midland Basin, located in West Texas, and the Delaware Basin, located in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico.  As a result of the EnLink Acquisitions, we have a meaningful presence in the Permian Basin, providing gathering and processing services in the Midland and Delaware Basins.\nNorth Texas region\n - The North Texas region is located in the Barnett Shale, one of the largest onshore natural gas fields in the United States.  As a result of the EnLink Acquisitions, we now provide gathering and processing services in the Barnett Shale. \n11\nTable of Contents\nProperty - \nOur Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment includes the following assets, which are wholly owned, except where noted, and exclude EnLink, which is shown separately below:\n•\n13,500 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines; \nand\n•\nNatural gas processing plants with 1.9 Bcf/d of processing capacity in the Rocky Mountain region and 1.0 Bcf/d in the Mid-Continent region, which were 84% and 77% utilized in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  In addition, we have up to 150 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Mid-Continent region through a long-term processing services agreement with an unaffiliated third party.\nWe calculate utilization rates using a weighted-average approach, adjusting for the dates that assets were placed in or removed from service.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe following are the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment assets added as a result of the EnLink Acquisitions:\n•\n9,000 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines (includes gross mileage of a consolidated, partially owned subsidiary); \nand\n•\nNatural gas processing plants with 1.4 Bcf/d of processing capacity in the Mid-Continent region, 1.7 Bcf/d of processing capacity in the Permian Basin region (includes gross operating capacity of a consolidated, partially owned subsidiary), 0.8 Bcf/d of processing capacity in the North Texas region.\nSources of Earnings\n - Earnings for this segment are derived primarily from the following types of service contracts:\n•\nFee with POP contracts with no producer take-in-kind rights - We purchase raw natural gas and charge contractual fees for providing midstream services, which include gathering, treating, compressing and processing the producers’ natural gas.  After performing these services, we sell the commodities and remit a portion of the commodity sales proceeds to the producers less our contractual fees.  This type of contract represented 76% and 72% of supply volumes in this segment, excluding EnLink, for 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n•\nFee with POP contracts with producer take-in-kind rights - We purchase a portion of the raw natural gas stream, charge fees for providing the midstream services listed above, return certain commodities to the producer, sell the remaining commodities and remit a portion of the commodity sales proceeds to the producer less our contractual fees.  This type of contract represented 19% of supply volumes in this segment, excluding EnLink, for both 2024 and 2023.  EnLink’s service contracts are primarily fee with POP contracts with producer take-in-kind rights to certain commodities.\n•\nFee-only - Under this type of contract, we charge a fee for the midstream services we provide based on volumes gathered, processed, treated and/or compressed.  Our fee-only contracts represented 5% and 9% of supply volumes in this segment, excluding EnLink, for 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor commodity sales, we contract to deliver residue natural gas, condensate and/or unfractionated NGLs to downstream customers at a specified delivery point.  Our sales of NGLs are primarily to our affiliate in the Natural Gas Liquids segment.\nUnconsolidated Affiliates\n - Our unconsolidated affiliates in this segment are not material.\nSee Note O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our unconsolidated affiliates.\nGovernment Regulation\n - The FERC traditionally has maintained that a natural gas processing plant is not a facility for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce and, therefore, is not subject to jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act.  Although the FERC has made no specific declaration as to the jurisdictional status of our natural gas processing operations or facilities, our natural gas processing plants are primarily involved in extracting NGLs and, therefore, are exempt from FERC jurisdiction.  The Natural Gas Act also exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC.  We believe our natural gas gathering facilities, upstream of our natural gas processing plants, meet the criteria used by the FERC for non-jurisdictional natural gas gathering facility status.  Interstate transmission facilities remain subject to FERC jurisdiction.  The FERC has historically distinguished between these two types of facilities, either interstate or intrastate, on a fact-specific basis.  We transport residue natural gas from certain of our natural gas processing plants to interstate pipelines in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended.  The states where we operate have statutes regulating, to varying degrees, the gathering of natural gas in those states.  In each state, regulation is applied on a case-by-case basis if a complaint is filed against the gatherer with the appropriate state regulatory agency.\nSee further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.\nNatural Gas Liquids\nOverview\n \nof Operations\n - In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, NGLs extracted at our own and third-party natural gas processing plants are gathered by our NGL gathering pipelines.  Gathered NGLs are directed to our downstream fractionators to be separated into Purity NGLs.  Purity NGLs are stored or distributed to our customers, such as petrochemical companies, propane distributors, diluent users, ethanol producers, refineries and exporters. \nWe provide midstream services to producers of NGLs in the Rocky Mountain region, Mid-Continent region, Permian Basin and Gulf Coast region (including Louisiana) and deliver those products to the market.  Our primary markets include the Mid-Continent in Conway, Kansas, the Gulf Coast in Mont Belvieu, Texas, Louisiana and the upper Midwest.  The majority of the pipeline-connected natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin, Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle as well as a large number in the Permian Basin, Barnett Shale, East Texas and Louisiana regions are connected to our NGL gathering \n13\nTable of Contents\nsystems.  Through our NGL gathering and distribution pipelines, and fractionation, terminal and storage facilities, we provide needed midstream services while connecting key supply and demand areas.\nProperty\n - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment includes the following assets, which are wholly owned, except where noted, and exclude EnLink, which is shown separately below:\n•\n9,300 miles of gathering pipelines; \n•\n4,800 miles of distribution pipelines; \n•\nNGL fractionators with combined operating capacity of 960 MBbl/d (includes interests in our proportional share of operating capacity), including 310 MBbl/d in the Mid-Continent region and 650 MBbl/d in the Mont Belvieu, Texas area, which were 92% and 98% utilized in 2024 and 2023, respectively;\n•\none isomerization unit with operating capacity of 10 MBbl/d;\n•\none ethane/propane splitter with operating capacity of 40 MBbl/d;\n•\nNGL storage facilities with operating storage capacity of 30 MMBbl; \nand\n•\neight Purity NGLs terminals.\nWe completed the construction of our 125 MBbl/d MB-6 fractionator, which is included in the assets listed above.  We are in the process of reconstructing our 210 MBbl/d fractionator in Medford, Oklahoma, which is excluded from the assets listed above.  \nIn addition, we have access to 6 MMBbl of combined NGL storage capacity at facilities in Kansas and Texas and 60 MBbl/d of\nNGL fractionation capacity in the Gulf Coast through service agreements.\nThe following are the Natural Gas Liquids segment assets added as a result of the EnLink Acquisitions:\n•\n800 miles of gathering pipelines (includes gross mileage of a consolidated, partially owned subsidiary);\n•\nNGL fractionators with combined operating capacity of 235 MBbl/d; \nand \n•\nNGL storage facility with operating storage capacity of approximately 10 MMBbl.\n14\nTable of Contents\nSee “Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report for more information on our capital projects.\nSources of Earnings\n - Earnings for our Natural Gas Liquids segment are derived primarily from fee-based services and commodity sales and purchases.  We purchase NGLs and condensate from third parties, as well as from our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment.  We also sell NGLs to our affiliate in the Refined Products and Crude segment.  Our business activities are categorized as follows:\n•\nExchange services - We utilize our assets to gather, transport, treat and fractionate NGLs, converting them into marketable Purity NGLs, and deliver them to a market center or customer-designated location.  Some of these exchange volumes are under contracts with minimum volume commitments that provide a minimum level of revenues regardless of volumetric throughput.  Our exchange services activities are primarily fee-based and include some rate-regulated tariffs; however, we also capture certain product price differentials through the fractionation process.\n•\nTransportation and storage services - We transport Purity NGLs and certain Refined Products, primarily under regulated tariffs.  Tariffs specify the maximum rates we may charge our customers and the general terms and conditions for transportation service on our pipelines.  Our storage activities consist primarily of fee-based NGL storage services at our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast storage facilities.\n•\nOptimization and marketing - We utilize our assets, contract portfolio and market knowledge to capture location, product and seasonal price differentials through the purchase and sale of unfractionated NGLs and Purity NGLs.  We  transport Purity NGLs between the Mid-Continent region, upper Midwest and Gulf Coast regions to capture the location price differentials between market centers.  Our marketing activities also include utilizing our NGL storage facilities to capture seasonal price differentials and serving marine, truck and rail markets.  Our isomerization activities capture the price differential when normal butane is converted into the more valuable iso-butane at our isomerization unit in Conway, Kansas.\nIn the majority of our exchange services contracts, we purchase the unfractionated NGLs at the tailgate of the processing plant and deduct contractual fees related to the transportation and fractionation services we must perform before we can sell them as Purity NGLs.  To the extent we hold unfractionated NGLs in inventory, the related contractual fees are not recognized until the unfractionated inventory is fractionated and sold.\nUnconsolidated Affiliates\n - We have a 50% ownership interest in Overland Pass, which operates an interstate NGL pipeline system extending 760 miles, originating in Wyoming and Colorado and terminating in Kansas.  Our other unconsolidated affiliates in this segment are not material.\nSee Note O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.\nGovernment Regulation\n - The operations and revenues of our NGL pipelines are regulated by various state and federal government agencies.  Our interstate NGL pipelines are regulated under the Interstate Commerce Act, which gives the FERC jurisdiction to regulate the terms and conditions of service, rates, including depreciation and amortization policies, and initiation of service.  Certain aspects of our intrastate NGL pipelines that provide common carrier service are subject to the jurisdiction of various state agencies in the states where we operate.\nSee further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.\nNatural Gas Pipelines\nOverview of Operations\n - In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we receive residue natural gas from third parties and our own natural gas processing plants and interconnecting pipelines.  Residue natural gas is transported or stored for end users, such as large industrial customers, natural gas and electric utilities serving commercial and residential consumers and can ultimately reach international markets through liquified natural gas exports and cross border pipelines.\nOur assets are connected to key supply areas and demand centers, including export markets in Mexico via Roadrunner and supply areas in Canada and the United States via our interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and Northern Border, which enables us to provide essential natural gas transportation and storage services.  Growing demand from data centers and continued demand from local distribution companies, electric-generation facilities and large industrial companies support low-cost expansions that position us well to provide additional services to our customers when needed. \n15\nTable of Contents\nIntrastate Pipelines and Storage\n - Our intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage assets are located in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas.  Our Oklahoma intrastate pipeline and storage assets have access to major natural gas production areas in the Mid-Continent region.  Our Texas intrastate pipeline and storage assets have access to major natural gas producing formations in the Texas Panhandle.  These assets provide shippers access to western markets, several markets to the southeast along the Gulf Coast, including the Houston Ship Channel, the Mid-Continent market to the north and exports to Mexico.

The rates are filed with FERC or the appropriate state jurisdictional agencies.  In addition, customers typically are assessed fees, such as a commodity charge, and we may retain a percentage of natural gas in-kind for our compression services. Our transportation earnings are primarily fee-based and utilize the following types of contracts:\n◦\nFirm service - Customers reserve a fixed quantity of pipeline capacity for a specified period of time, which obligates the customer to pay regardless of usage.  Under this type of contract, the customer pays a monthly fixed fee and incremental fees, known as commodity charges, which are based on the actual volumes of \n17\nTable of Contents\nnatural gas they transport or store.  Under the firm service contract, the customer generally is guaranteed access to the capacity they reserve.\n◦\nInterruptible service - Under interruptible service transportation agreements, the customer may utilize available capacity after firm service requests are satisfied.  The customer is not guaranteed use of our pipelines unless excess capacity is available. \n•\nStorage services - Our storage earnings are primarily fee-based and utilize the following types of contracts:\n◦\nFirm service - Customers reserve a specific quantity of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and generally pay fixed fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved plus an injection and withdrawal fee based on actual usage.  Our firm storage contracts typically have terms longer than one year.\n◦\nPark-and-loan service - An interruptible storage service offered to customers providing the ability to park (inject) or loan (withdraw) natural gas into or out of our storage, typically for monthly or seasonal terms.  Customers reserve the right to park or loan natural gas based on a specified quantity, including injection and withdrawal rights when capacity is available.\n•\nOptimization and marketing - As a result of the EnLink Acquisitions, we also derive earnings from providing natural gas marketing and optimization for our customers.\nUnconsolidated Affiliates\n - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:\n•\n50% ownership interest in Northern Border, which owns a FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Montana-Saskatchewan border near Port of Morgan, Montana, and the Williston Basin in North Dakota to a terminus near North Hayden, Indiana.\n•\n50% ownership interest in Roadrunner, a bidirectional pipeline, which has the capacity to transport 570 MMcf/d of natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas, and has capacity to transport approximately 1.0 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Delaware Basin to the Waha Hub area.  We are the operator of Roadrunner.\n•\nAs a result of the EnLink Acquisitions, 15% ownership interest in Matterhorn, a bidirectional pipeline, which has capacity to transport 2.5 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Waha Hub to Katy, Texas. \nSee Note O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.\nGovernment Regulation\n - \nInterstate\n - Our interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated under the Natural Gas Act, which gives the FERC jurisdiction to regulate virtually all aspects of this business, such as transportation of natural gas, rates and charges for services, construction of new facilities, depreciation and amortization policies, acquisition and disposition of facilities and the initiation and discontinuation of services.\nIntrastate\n - Our intrastate natural gas pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas are subject to rate regulation by state regulators and by the FERC under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended, for certain services where we deliver natural gas into FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines.  While we have flexibility in establishing natural gas transportation rates with customers, there is a maximum rate that we can charge our customers in Oklahoma and Kansas and for the services regulated by the FERC.  In Texas and Kansas, natural gas storage may be regulated by the state and by the FERC for certain types of services.  In Oklahoma, natural gas storage operations are not subject to rate regulation by the state, and we have market-based rate authority from the FERC for certain types of intrastate services.\nSee further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.\nRefined Products and Crude\nOverview\n \nof Operations\n - Our Refined Products and Crude segment is principally engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of Refined Products and crude oil.  As a result of the EnLink Acquisitions and the Medallion Acquisition, we are also engaged in the gathering of crude oil\n.\n  Crude oil pipelines gather and transport crude oil to refineries, export facilities and demand centers.  Throughout our distribution system, terminals play a key role in facilitating product movements and marketing by providing storage, distribution, blending and other ancillary services.  Products transported on our Refined Products pipeline system include gasoline, distillates, aviation fuel and certain NGLs.  Shipments originate on our Refined Products pipeline system from direct connections to refineries or through interconnections with other pipelines or terminals for transportation and ultimate distribution to retail fueling stations, convenience stores, travel centers, railroads, airports and other end users.  \n18\nTable of Contents\nOur Refined Products pipeline system is one of the longest common carrier pipeline systems for Refined Products in the United States, extending from the Texas Gulf Coast and covering a 15-state area across the central and western United States.  Our crude oil assets are strategically located to transport and store crude oil and are connected to multiple trading and demand centers.  We have existing crude oil pipelines in Kansas and Oklahoma, and from the Permian Basin in West Texas to our East Houston terminal.  Our Houston distribution system connects our East Houston terminal through several interchanges to various points, including multiple refineries throughout the Houston area and crude oil import and export facilities.  Our Cushing terminal primarily receives and distributes crude oil via the multiple pipelines that terminate in and originate from the Cushing hub.  Our Corpus Christi terminal provides terminalling services and includes our splitter.  \nAs a result of the EnLink Acquisitions and the Medallion Acquisition, we acquired crude oil gathering pipelines and crude oil storage facilities in the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent region.\nProperty -\n Our Refined Products and Crude segment includes the following wholly owned assets, which exclude EnLink and Medallion, which are shown separately below:\n•\n9,800 miles of Refined Products pipelines;\n•\n1,100 miles of crude oil pipelines;\n•\n53 Refined Products terminals;\n•\ntwo marine terminals; \nand\n•\n97 MMBbl of operating storage capacity.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following are the Refined Products and Crude segment assets added as a result of the EnLink Acquisitions and the Medallion Acquisition:\n•\n2,100 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines; \nand\n•\n2 MMBbl of operating storage capacity.\nWe are in the process of constructing our greater Denver area pipeline expansion project.  The project includes construction of a new 230-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline from Scott City, Kansas, to Denver International Airport and the addition or upgrading of certain pump stations and will increase total system capacity by 35 MBbl/d and have additional expansion capabilities.  This project is excluded from the assets listed above.  \nSee “Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report for more information on our capital projects.\nSources of Earnings \n-\n \nEarnings in this segment are derived primarily from transportation, storage and terminal services and product sales:\n•\nTransportation services - We generate revenue from tariffs on volumes gathered and transported on our Refined Products and crude oil pipeline systems.  These transportation tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates and where ultimate delivery occurs.  Transportation fees are in published tariffs filed with the FERC or the appropriate state agency or established by negotiated rates. \n•\nStorage and terminal services - We generate additional revenue from providing pipeline capacity and tank storage services, as well as providing services such as terminalling, ethanol and biodiesel unloading and loading, and additive injection, which are performed under short-term and long-term agreements.\n•\nOptimization and marketing - At times, we obtain Refined Products and crude oil and utilize our assets, contract portfolio and market knowledge to capture location, product and seasonal price differentials through liquids blending and purchases and sales of product, including transmix, which is a mixture that forms when different Refined Products are transported in pipelines.  \nUnconsolidated Affiliates\n - Our Refined Products and Crude segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:\n•\na 30% ownership interest in BridgeTex, which owns an approximately 400-mile crude oil pipeline with transport capacity of up to 440 MBbl/d that connects Permian Basin crude oil to our East Houston terminal;\n•\na 40% ownership interest in Saddlehorn, which owns an undivided joint interest in an approximately 600-mile pipeline, with transport capacity of up to 290 MBbl/d of crude oil from the Denver-Julesburg Basin and Rocky Mountain region to storage facilities in Cushing, including our Cushing terminal; \nand\n•\na 25% ownership in MVP, which owns a Refined Products marine storage terminal along the Houston Ship Channel in Pasadena, Texas, including more than 5 MMBbl of storage, two ship docks and truck loading facilities.\nOur other unconsolidated affiliates in this segment are not material.\nSee Note O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.\nGovernment Regulation\n - Our interstate common carrier pipelines are subject to rate regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and related rules and orders.  Most of the tariff rates on our long-haul pipelines are established under market-based rate authority or via negotiated rates that generally allow for annual inflation-based adjustments.  Some shipments on our pipeline systems are considered to be in intrastate commerce and are subject to certain regulations with respect to such intrastate transportation by state regulatory authorities in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas or Wyoming.  In future rate or rulemaking proceedings, the FERC or state regulatory authorities could reduce rates prospectively, limit our ability to increase future rates or modify the way rates are currently established.  In certain circumstances, a change could also require the payment of refunds to shippers.  \nSee further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.\nMarket Conditions and Seasonality\n \nSupply and Demand\n \n-\n \nSupply for each of our segments depends on crude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities, which are driven by the strength of the economy and impacts of geopolitical events; crude oil, natural gas, NGL and Refined \n20\nTable of Contents\nProducts prices; the demand for each of these products from end users; changes in gas-to-oil ratios and the decline rate of existing production; refinery maintenance cycles; producer access to capital and investment in the industry; connections to pipelines and refineries; and producer firm commitments to transportation pipelines.\nDemand for gathering and processing services is dependent on natural gas and crude oil production by producers in the regions in which we operate.  Demand for NGLs and the ability of natural gas processors to sustain their operations successfully and economically affect the volume of unfractionated NGLs produced by natural gas processing plants, thereby affecting the demand for NGL gathering, transportation and fractionation services.  Natural gas and Purity NGLs are affected by the demand associated with the various industries that utilize the commodities, such as butanes and natural gasoline used by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and diluents for crude oil.  Ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline are also used by the petrochemical industry to produce chemical components, used for a range of products that improve our daily lives and promote economic growth, including health care products, recyclable food packaging, clothing, technology, building materials, industrial, manufacturing and energy infrastructure, lightweight vehicle components and batteries.  Propane is also used to heat homes and businesses.  Demand for Refined Products is influenced by many factors, including driving patterns, consumer preferences, economic conditions, population changes, government regulations, changes in vehicle fuel efficiency and the development of alternative energy sources.  The demand for Refined Products in the market areas served by our pipeline system has historically been stable.  Demand for shipments on our crude oil pipelines is driven primarily by crude oil production and takeaway demand in the regions in which we operate.  Demand for natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil is also impacted by global macroeconomic factors.  \nCommodity Prices\n - Our earnings are primarily fee-based in all of our segments; however, we are exposed to some commodity price risk.  As part of our hedging strategy, we use commodity derivative financial instruments and physical-forward contracts to reduce the impact of price fluctuations related to natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.  Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of retaining a portion of the commodity sales proceeds associated with our fee with POP contracts and our POP contracts with take-in-kind rights.  Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment follows a programmatic approach to hedging commodity price risk and expects to hedge approximately 75% of its monthly equity volumes over time.  Under certain fee with POP contracts, our contractual fees and POP percentage may increase or decrease if production volumes, delivery pressures or commodity prices change relative to specified thresholds.  In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we are exposed to commodity price risk associated with changes in the price of NGLs; the location differential between the Conway, Kansas, upper Midwest region, Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Louisiana; and the relative price differential between natural gas, NGLs and individual Purity NGLs, which affect our NGL purchases and sales, our exchange services, transportation and storage services, and optimization and marketing financial results.  NGL storage revenue may be affected by price volatility and forward pricing of NGL physical contracts versus the current price of NGLs on the spot market.  We are also exposed to changes in the price of power, which can impact our fractionation and transportation costs.  In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we are exposed to minimal commodity price risk associated with (i) changes in the price of natural gas, which impact our fuel costs and retained fuel in-kind received for our compression services; and (ii) the differential between forward pricing of natural gas physical contracts and the price of natural gas on the spot market, which may affect customer demand for our natural gas storage services.  In our Refined Products and Crude segment, we are exposed to some commodity price risk, including product price and location differentials primarily from our optimization and marketing activities, as well as product retained during the operations of our pipelines and terminals.  See additional discussion regarding our commodity price risk and related hedging activities under “Commodity Price Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in this Annual Report.\nSeasonality\n - Cold temperatures usually increase demand for natural gas and certain Purity NGLs, such as propane, a heating fuel for homes and businesses.  Warm temperatures usually increase demand for natural gas used in gas-fired electric generation for residential and commercial cooling, as well as agriculture-related equipment like irrigation pumps and crop dryers.  Demand for butanes and natural gasoline, which are used by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and diluents for crude oil, are also subject to some variability during seasonal periods when certain government restrictions on motor fuel blending products change.  Additionally, our liquids blending activities are limited by seasonal changes in gasoline vapor pressure specifications and by the varying quantity of the gasoline delivered to us.  During periods of peak demand for a certain commodity, prices for that product typically increase.  \nExtreme weather conditions, seasonal temperature changes and the impact of temperature and humidity on the mechanical abilities of equipment impact the volumes of natural gas gathered and processed, NGL volumes gathered, transported and fractionated, and Refined Products and crude oil volumes transported and stored.  Power interruptions and inaccessible well sites as a result of severe storms or freeze-offs, a phenomenon where water vapor from the well bore freezes at the wellhead or within the natural gas gathering system, may cause a temporary interruption in the flow of natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.  \n21\nTable of Contents\nIn our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, natural gas storage is necessary to balance the relatively steady natural gas supply with the seasonal demand of our local natural gas distribution and electric-generation customers as a result of the demand from their residential and commercial customers.\nCompetition\n \n- We compete for natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil volumes with other midstream companies, major integrated oil companies and independent exploration and production companies that have gathering and processing assets, fractionators, pipelines, terminals and storage facilities.  The factors that typically affect our ability to compete for natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil volumes are:\n•\nquality and quantity of services provided;\n•\nproducer drilling activity;\n•\nproceeds remitted and/or fees charged under our contracts;\n•\nproximity of our assets to natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil supply areas and markets;\n•\nproximity of our assets to alternative energy production;\n•\nlocation of our assets relative to those of our competitors;\n•\nefficiency and reliability of our operations;\n•\nreceipt and delivery capabilities for natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil that exist in each pipeline system, plant, fractionator, terminal and storage location;\n•\nthe petrochemical industry’s level of capacity utilization and feedstock requirements;\n•\ncurrent and forward natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil prices; \nand\n•\ncost of and access to capital.\nWe have remained competitive by executing strategic acquisitions; making capital investments to access and connect new supplies with end-user demand; increasing gathering, processing, fractionation and pipeline capacity; increasing storage, withdrawal and injection capabilities; and improving operating efficiency.  Our and our competitors’ infrastructure projects may affect commodity prices and could displace supply volumes from the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions and the Permian Basin where our assets are located.  We believe our assets are located strategically, connecting diverse supply areas to market and demand centers.\nCustomers\n - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, Natural Gas Liquids and Refined Products and Crude segments derive fees for services from major and independent crude oil and natural gas producers.  Our Natural Gas Liquids segment’s customers also include other NGL and natural gas gathering and processing companies.  Our downstream commodity sales customers are primarily petrochemical, refining and marketing companies, utilities, large industrial companies, natural gasoline distributors, propane distributors, exporters and municipalities.  Our Refined Products and Crude segment’s customers also include crude oil producers, refiners, wholesalers, retailers, traders, railroads, airlines and regional farm cooperatives.  End markets for Refined Products deliveries are primarily retail gasoline stations, truck stops, farm cooperatives, railroad fueling depots, military bases and commercial airports.  Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment’s assets primarily serve local distribution companies, electric-generation facilities, large industrial companies, municipalities, producers, processors and marketing companies.  Our utility customers generally require our services regardless of commodity prices.  See discussion regarding our customer credit risk under “Counterparty Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in this Annual Report.\nOther\nThrough ONEOK Leasing Company, L.L.C. and ONEOK Parking Company, L.L.C., we own a 17-story office building (ONEOK Plaza) and a parking garage in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, where our headquarters are located.  ONEOK Leasing Company, L.L.C. primarily operates our headquarters office building.  ONEOK Parking Company, L.L.C. owns and operates a parking garage adjacent to our headquarters.  We have a wholly owned captive insurance company, which was formed in 2022.\nREGULATORY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS\nWe are subject to a variety of historical preservation and environmental and safety laws and/or regulations that affect many aspects of our present and future operations.  Regulated activities include, but are not limited to, those involving air emissions, storm water and wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, wetland and waterway preservation, wildlife conservation, cultural resource protection, hazardous materials transportation, cleanup of spills or releases of hazardous substances and pipeline and facility construction.  These laws and regulations require us to obtain and/or comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances, registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals.  Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, licenses and permits may expose us to fines, penalties, reputational harm, claims or lawsuits from third parties, and/or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations or financial condition.  We may \n22\nTable of Contents\nalso incur material costs for cleanup of spills or releases of hazardous substances.  In addition, emissions controls and/or other regulatory or permitting mandates under the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended (Clean Air Act), and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities.  We cannot ensure that existing environmental statutes and regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us.  We also cannot ensure that existing permits will not be revised or cancelled, potentially impacting facility construction activities or ongoing operations.\nAir and Water Emissions\n - The Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, as amended (Clean Water Act), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and analogous state laws and/or regulations impose restrictions and controls regarding the release of pollutants into the air and water in the United States.  Under the Clean Air Act, a federal operating permit is required for sources of significant air emissions.  We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution-control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals for sources of air emissions.  The Clean Water Act imposes substantial potential liability for pollutants discharged into waters of the United States and requires remediation of waters affected by such discharge.  The Oil Pollution Act aims at preventing and responding to oil spills in U.S. waters and shorelines. \nGHG Emissions\n - In 2023, GHG emissions were approximately 3.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents of Scope 1 emissions and 3.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents of Scope 2 emissions.  Scope 1 emissions originate from the combustion of fuel in our equipment, such as compressor engines and heaters, as well as fugitive methane emissions.  Scope 2 emissions are generated from purchased power sources. \nIn 2021, we announced a companywide absolute GHG emissions reduction target of 2.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents from our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2030 for our legacy ONEOK assets.  The target represents a 30% reduction in combined operational Scope 1 and location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions \nattributable to ONEOK assets as of Dec. 31, 2019.  As of\n Dec. 31, 2024, we\n have achieved reductions totaling \napproximately 1.7 million met\nric tons of the targeted 2.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivale\nnts, primarily as a result of methane emissions mitigation, system utilization and optimizations, electrification of certain natural gas compression equipment and lower carbon-based electricity in states in which we operate.  GHG emission reductions as reported may be modified, updated, changed or supplemented based on available information.  For the years ended Dec. 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any material dedicated capital expenditures specifically for climate-related projects, nor did we purchase or sell carbon credits or offsets.  Progress to date on our goal has been accomplished through routine capital projects and asset optimizations that were primarily performed for operational improvements that inherently improved our emissions profile.  We continue to anticipate several potential pathways toward achieving our emissions reduction target.  In 2025, we intend to work towards further reductions in our emissions toward our target through improved methane management practices and system optimization that will not require material capital expenditures.  We do not anticipate purchasing or selling carbon credits or offsets in 2025.  \nWe currently participate in Our Nation’s Energy (ONE) Future Coalition to voluntarily report methane emission reductions and to calculate our methane intensity for our natural gas transmission and storage assets.  We continue to focus on maintaining low methane gas release rates through expanded implementation of improved practices to limit the release of natural gas during pipeline and facility maintenance and operations.\nWe are a participant in the American Petroleum Institute’s The Environmental Partnership and are enrolled in environmental performance programs that are designed to further reduce emissions using proven, cost-effective controls.\nRegulation\n \nUnited States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration\n (\nPHMSA)\n - On Jan. 17, 2025, the PHMSA issued a final rule, which has been submitted to the Federal Register underscoring to pipeline and pipeline facility operator’s requirements to minimize methane emissions in the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020.  The PIPES Act directs pipeline operators to update their inspection and maintenance plans to address the elimination of hazardous leaks and to minimize natural gas releases from pipeline facilities.  The updated plans must also address the replacement or remediation of pipeline facilities that historically have been known to experience leaks.  We have completed and continue to update our pipeline maintenance procedures to identify and reduce methane leaks.\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n - The EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires annual GHG emissions reporting from our affected facilities and the carbon dioxide emission equivalents for all hydrocarbon liquids produced by us as if all products were combusted, even if they are used otherwise.  The additional cost to gather and report this emission data did not have, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, the EPA finalized its rule targeting oil and gas section emissions of greenhouse gases (primarily methane) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The rule includes (i) new source performance standards codified in 40 C.F.R. Part 60 Subpart OOOOb for new sources (i.e., facilities that commence construction, reconstruction, or modification after Dec. 6, 2022), (ii) emission guidelines codified in 40 C.F.R. Part 60 Subpart OOOOc that states must use to develop performance standards for existing sources (i.e., facilities that existed on or before Dec. 6, 2022).  This final rule was challenged in court by states and industry stakeholders, which litigation is ongoing.  In addition, in January 2025, the new administration issued an executive order directing the heads of all federal agencies to identify and begin the processes to suspend, revise or rescind all agency actions that are unduly burdensome on the identification, development or use of domestic energy resources.  Consequently, future implementation and enforcement of the final rule remain uncertain.  At this time, we do not anticipate a material impact to our planned capital, operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the current or pending regulations and proposed EPA actions.  However, the EPA and/or state regulators may issue additional regulations, responses, amendments and/or policy guidance, which could alter our present expectations. \nRenewable Fuel Standard \n- We are an obligated party under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) promulgated by the EPA and are required to satisfy our Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) on an annual basis.  To meet our RVO, we must either ensure that the transportation fuel we produce in our optimization and marketing activities contains the mandated renewable fuel components or purchase credits to cover any shortfall.  We generally satisfy our RVO requirements through the purchase of RINs.  RINs are generated when a gallon of renewable fuel is produced and may be separated when the renewable fuel is blended into gasoline or diesel fuel, at which point the RIN is available for use in compliance or available for sale on the open market.  As the RFS program is currently structured, the RVO of all obligated parties may increase over time unless adjusted by the EPA.  The ability to incorporate increasing volumes of renewable fuel components into fuel products and the availability of RINs may be limited, which could increase our RFS compliance costs or limit our ability to blend.\nIn 2024, the EPA finalized changes to the federal gasoline distribution reg\nulations.\n \nWe do not anticipate a material im\npact to our planned capital, operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the current regulations.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the EPA’s fuels compliance regulations.  These regulations include standards for fuel parameters and require rigorous product sampling and testing, recordkeeping and reportin\ng.  Our ongoing compliance with these regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFederal Regulation \n- In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law.  The IRA includes tax credits and other incentives intended to combat climate change by advancing decarbonization and promoting increased investment in renewable and low carbon intensity energy.  In addition, the IRA directed the EPA to impose and collect “Waste Emissions Charges,” or “Methane Fees,” for specific facilities th\nat report more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of GHG emissions per year and have a methane emissions intensity in excess of the relevant statutory threshold.  In January 2025, industry associations and certain states challenged the Waste Emissions Charge rule in the D.C. Circuit, and the new administration issued an executive order directing the heads of all federal agencies to identify and begin the processes to suspend, revise or rescind all agency actions that are unduly burdensome on the identification, development or use of domestic energy resources.  Consequently, future implementation and enforcement of these rules remain uncertain at this time.  Based on text in the IRA and a related rule that the EPA finalized in November 2024 that will require payment of Methane Fees to the EPA beginning in 2025 (for 2024 reported emissions), the 2024 Methane Fees, if implemented, will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe believe it is likely that continued future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us to limit GHG emissions associated with our operations, pay additional fees associated with our GHG emissions or purchase allowances for such emissions.  However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations will take, the stringency of the regulations, when they will become effective or the impact on our capital expenditures, competitive position and results of operations.  In addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of GHG emissions sooner than or independent of federal regulation, these regulations could be more stringent than requirements in any future federal legislation and/or regulation.  We monitor all relevant legislation and regulatory initiatives to assess the potential impact on our operations and otherwise take steps to limit GHG emissions from our facilities, including methane.  \nFor additional information regarding the potential impact of laws and regulations on our operations see Item 1A “Risk Factors.” \nWaste\n - Our operations generate waste, including hazardous waste, that is subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (RCRA), and comparable state statutes.  We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements as our operations routinely generate only small quantities of hazardous waste, and we are not a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility operator that is required to obtain a RCRA \n24\nTable of Contents\npermit.  While the RCRA currently exempts a number of types of waste from being subject to hazardous waste requirements, including many oil and gas exploration and production wastes, the EPA could consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous waste.  Moreover, it is possible that additional waste, which could include non-hazardous waste currently generated during operations, may be designated as hazardous waste.  Hazardous waste is subject to more rigorous and costly storage and disposal requirements than non-hazardous waste.  Changes in the regulations could materially increase our operating expenses.\nWe own or lease properties where hydrocarbons have been handled for many years, during which operating and disposal standards have evolved.  Although we believe we have utilized operating and disposal practices that meet prevailing industry standards, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or at offsite disposal facilities.  In addition, many of these properties were previously operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other waste was not under our control.  These properties and waste disposal facilities may be subject to Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, RCRA and analogous state laws.  Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed waste, including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators, to remediate contaminated property, including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators, or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination.\nPipeline and Facility Safety\n - We are subject to PHMSA safety regulations, including pipeline asset integrity-management regulations.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 requires pipeline companies operating high-pressure pipelines to perform integrity assessments on pipeline segments that pass through densely populated areas or near specifically designated high-consequence areas (HCAs).  The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) increased maximum penalties for violating federal pipeline safety regulations, directs the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and Secretary of Transportation to conduct further review or studies on issues that may or may not be material to us and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations.  Penalty amounts have since been regularly adjusted for inflation with the most recent adjustment taking effect on Dec. 30, 2024.  In 2015 through 2022, PHMSA issued notices of proposed rulemaking for hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations, natural gas transmission and gathering lines and underground natural gas storage facilities.  For natural gas and natural gas gathering pipelines, the new proposed regulations became known as “the Mega Rule.”  The Mega Rule increased requirements for operating and maintenance, integrity management, public awareness and civil/criminal penalties with full compliance deadlines extending into 2035; however, we do not anticipate a material impact to our planned capital or operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with these requirements.\nOur NGL, Refined Products and crude oil pipeline systems are subject to regulation by the DOT and PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA).  The HLPSA prescribes and enforces minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, including the design, construction, testing, operation and maintenance, spill response planning and overall reporting and management related to our pipeline facilities.  In addition to the amended HLPSA covered in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, subsequent statutes provide the framework for the pipeline hazardous liquid safety program and include provisions related to PHMSA’s authorities, administration and regulatory activities.  \nIn 2020, legislation was passed to reauthorize PHMSA through 2024.  Legislation is currently pending to extend this authorization.  Certain requirements for operations and maintenance, integrity management, leak detection and public awareness will be subject to future rulemaking as a result.  The potential capital and operating expenditures related to the new regulations are not fully known, but we do not anticipate a material impact to our planned capital or operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the new regulations.\nOur marine terminals along coastal waterways are subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations and comparable state and municipal statutes relating to the design, installation, construction, testing, operation, replacement and management of these assets.\nCertain of our field injection and withdrawal wells and water disposal wells are subject to the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC).  The RRC regulations require that we report the volumes of natural gas and water disposal associated with the operations of such wells on a monthly and annual basis, respectively.  Results of periodic mechanical integrity tests must also be reported to the RRC.  In addition, our underground natural gas storage caverns in Louisiana are subject to the jurisdiction of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR).  In recent years, LDNR has put in place more comprehensive regulations governing underground hydrocarbon storage in salt caverns, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with these newer regulations.\n25\nTable of Contents\nPHMSA regulates safety issues related to downhole facilities located at both intrastate and interstate underground natural gas storage facilities.  PHMSA mandates certain reporting requirements for operators of underground natural gas storage facilities and sets minimum federal safety standards.  In addition, all intrastate transportation-related underground natural gas storage facilities are subject to minimum federal safety standards and are inspected by PHMSA or by a state entity that has chosen to expand its authority to regulate these facilities under a certification filed with PHMSA.  State entities that exercise jurisdiction over our underground natural gas storage facilities include the RRC (for our underground natural gas storage facilities in Texas) and LDNR (for our underground natural gas storage facilities in Louisiana).  We do not believe continued compliance with safety standards and other requirements applicable to our underground natural gas storage facilities will have a material impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn July 2022, a fire occurred at our 210 MBbl/d Medford, Oklahoma, NGL fractionation facility.  All personnel were safe and accounted for with temporary evacuations of local residents taken as a precautionary measure.  As a result of the incident, the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) requested information including the incident investigation report and causal factors of the incident, which we submitted to the CSB.  This inquiry is still active with the CSB. \nPipeline Security\n - In April 2021, the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released revised pipeline security guidelines that included broader definitions for the determination of pipeline “critical facilities.”  In September 2024, we completed our annual review of our pipeline facilities according to the guidelines.  The cost of compliance did not have a material impact on our operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn July 2021, the TSA began issuing pipeline security directives to owners and/or operators of critical pipeline systems or facilities.  Pursuant to those directives, our Cybersecurity Implementation Plan was last approved in August 2024, and our Cybersecurity Assessment Plan was last approved in September 2024.  While compliance with the security directives requires significant internal and external resources, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nThe long-term sustainability of our business is dependent on our continued ability to maintain a highly engaged workforce.  To accomplish this, our business strategy includes attracting, selecting and retaining talent, advancing an inclusive, diverse and engaged culture and developing individuals and leaders.\nWe conduct employee engagement surveys, typically on an annual basis.  In 2024, the annual employee engagement participation rate increased to 93% compared with 90% in 2022, the last year a survey was conducted.  We did not complete a survey in 2023 as we focused on stabilizing and integrating our employee base following the Magellan Acquisition.  The overall engagement mean increased to the 80th percentile and the ratio of engaged employees to actively disengaged also increased.  All leaders have been asked to discuss the 2024 survey results with their teams and create an engagement plan for 2025.  Training and support resources are available through our learning management system, the Gallup engagement portal and dedicated individuals, engagement champions, within the business.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2024, we had 5,177 employees, which excludes EnLink employees.  Listed below is a summary of our human capital resources, measures and objectives that are collectively important to our success as an organization.  \nValues \n- Our success relies on the skills, experience and dedication of our employees.  We are committed to cultivating an inclusive and dynamic work environment where people can find opportunities to succeed, grow and contribute to the success of the company.  Our employees work each day to provide safe and reliable services to a wide range of customers in the states where we operate.  Our core values, listed below, guide our employee behaviors and the ways in which we conduct our business and operations. \n•\nSafety & Environmental: we commit to a zero-incident culture for the well-being of our employees, contractors and communities and to operate in an environmentally responsible manner.\n•\nEthics: we act with honesty, integrity and adherence to the highest standards of personal and professional conduct.\n•\nInclusion & Diversity: we respect the uniqueness and worth of each individual, and we believe that an inclusive culture and diverse workforce are essential for a sense of belonging, engagement and performance.\n•\nExcellence: we hold ourselves and others accountable to a standard of excellence through continuous improvement and teamwork.\n•\nService: we invest our time, effort and resources to serve each other, our customers and communities.\n•\nInnovation: we seek to develop creative solutions by leveraging collaboration through ingenuity and technology.\n26\nTable of Contents\nInclusion\n \nand Diversity\n - Our inclusion and diversity (I&D) strategy is a cross-functional effort that draws upon contributions from employees at all levels of the organization and is focused on enhancing the workplace to attract and retain talent.  The strategy is guided by a council composed of a diverse group of employees who represent different demographics, work locations, points of view, roles and levels of seniority.  We also have a team within our human resources department that is wholly dedicated to supporting our I&D efforts.\nWe provide support for four employee-led business resource groups (BRGs) that include a Racial/Ethnic Inclusion Resource Group, Veterans Resource Group, Women’s Resource Group and LGBTQ+ Resource Group.  The purpose of these groups is to promote the attraction, development, engagement and retention of members of traditionally underrepresented groups in our industry and workplace in an effort to drive positive business outcomes.  A key factor in the success of our BRGs is the active participation by officer-level executive sponsors and allies from outside the BRG’s underrepresented populations.  All employees are invited to become supporters of our BRGs.\nWe embed I&D concepts into our core leadership development curriculum and sponsor a number of internal programs intended to promote I&D.  In addition, we seek to give back to the communities where we operate by partnering on initiatives to support underrepresented community members and local charitable organizations.\nEmployee Safety\n - The safety of our employees is critical to our operations and success.  By promoting the safety of our employees and monitoring the integrity of our assets, we are investing in the long-term sustainability of our businesses.  We continuously assess the risks our employees face in their jobs, and we work to mitigate those risks through training, appropriate engineering controls, work procedures and other preventive safety programs.  Reducing incidents and improving our personal safety incident rates are important, but we are not focused only on statistics.  Low personal safety incident rates alone cannot prevent a large-scale incident, which is why we continue to focus on enhancing our Environmental, Safety and Health management systems and process safety programs, such as key risk/key control identification and knowledge sharing.  We endeavor to operate our assets safely, reliably and in an environmentally responsible manner.  We maintain mature and robust programs that guide trained staff in the completion of these activities, and we continue to enhance and improve these programs and our internal capabilities.  \nHealth and Welfare\n - We provide a variety of benefits to help promote the health and welfare of our employees and their families.  These benefits include medical, dental and vision plans, virtual health visits and engagement of third-party service providers to offer company on-site and near-site clinics in several of our operating areas.  Eligible employees also have access, at no charge, to an employee assistance program, a medical second opinion service and a health care concierge service to assist with finding in-network providers and billing resolution.  We offer full pay for maternity, paternity or adoption leave of up to 240 hours per qualifying event.  We also provide up to $10,000 for reasonable and necessary expenses of a qualifying adoption and/or surrogacy.  Additional benefits available for the welfare of our employees include, among others, life insurance and long-term disability plans, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, fertility benefits, disease prevention and management programs and full pay while on bereavement, military or personal and family care leave.  We expect that beginning on May 1, 2025, legacy EnLink employees will have access to these ONEOK health and welfare benefits.  \nWe also provide the opportunity for our employees to help fellow employees through the ONE Trust Fund by contributing donated vacation hours or monetary donations.  The ONE Trust Fund is a nonprofit, charitable organization run entirely by employee volunteers, that serves our employees in times of personal crises due to natural disasters, medical emergencies or other hardships.  Further, we provide volunteer opportunities and volunteer grants, as well as $10,000 of charitable giving matching, annually, through the ONEOK Foundation.  Subsequent to the EnLink Acquisition completed on Jan. 31, 2025, we expect legacy EnLink employees to have access to the ONE Trust Fund benefits and can begin making contributions to the fund beginning on May 1, 2025.\nPersonal and Professional Development\n - We provide various options to assist with career growth and development.  For employees just entering the workforce who desire to advance their career and continue to learn or for the employees who are interested in developing their skills, we provide education and training in a variety of areas, including leadership, functional and industry-specific topics, professional development and skill-building opportunities.  Our organizational development and I&D teams provide live in-person and virtual classroom training, computer-based self-study and one-on-one coaching that is available to all employees.\nWe value education and assist eligible employees with the expense of furthering their education in job-related fields, including up to $5,250 per year in qualifying tuition expenses.  We also may reimburse employees for certain job-related professional certification examination fees.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRecruiting\n - We make it a priority to attract, select, develop, motivate, challenge and retain the talent necessary to support our key business strategies.  We use targeted recruitment events, maintain strong relationships with area technical schools, colleges and universities, and we offer compensation benefits and career opportunities that are designed to position us as an employer of choice.  I&D continues to be a priority in recruiting, and we deploy sourcing strategies designed to access talent from groups that are historically underrepresented in our industry and workplace.  \nRetirement\n - We maintain a 401(k) Plan for our employees and match 100% of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation each payroll period, subject to applicable tax limits.  We have a legacy defined benefit pension plan covering certain employees and former employees, which closed to new participants in 2005.  In addition, as a result of the Magellan Acquisition, we assumed the pension and postretirement benefit obligations for Magellan employees and former employees.  These obligations are composed of two defined benefit pension plans, including one for non-union employees and one for union employees, as well as a postretirement welfare benefit plan for certain employees.  The pension plan for non-union employees closed to new participants upon the closing of the Magellan Acquisition.  The pension plan for union employees closed to new participants in January 2024.  Employees who do not participate in our defined benefit pension plan are eligible to receive quarterly and annual profit-sharing contributions under our 401(k) Plan.  Effective Jan. 1, 2025, the profit-sharing quarterly contributions increased to 6% from 1% of quarterly eligible compensation.  We will continue to make annual discretionary contributions of up to 2% of eligible compensation.  As of Dec. 31, 2024, 96% of eligible employees were contributing to our 401(k) Plan.  For additional information about our retirement benefits, see Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nAll executive officers are elected annually by our Board of Directors.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1, Business, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nPlease refer to the “Financial Results and Operating Information” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report for additional information.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nEnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition\n - On Oct. 15, 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, acquiring GIP’s interest in EnLink consisting of approximately 43% of the outstanding EnLink Units for $14.90 in cash per unit and 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests in the managing member of EnLink for $300 million, for total cash consideration of $3.3 billion.  Through our 100% ownership of the managing member of EnLink, we obtained control of EnLink. We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.\nThis acquisition meaningfully increases our scale and integrated value chain within the growing Permian Basin while expanding and extending our asset bases in the Mid-Continent, North Texas and Louisiana regions.  We expect to achieve significant synergies by combining our complementary asset positions.  Financial results and operating information related to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition impacts all four business segments and is included with “Financial Results and Operating Information” for the period Oct. 15, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024. \nEnLink Acquisition\n - On Nov. 24, 2024, we entered into the EnLink Merger Agreement to acquire all of the publicly held EnLink Units in an all stock, tax-free transaction.  On Jan. 31, 2025, we completed the EnLink Acquisition.  Pursuant to the EnLink Merger Agreement, each common unit of EnLink was exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock, including EnLink Units that were exchanged for all previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units immediately prior to closing.  We issued 41 million shares of common stock, with a fair value of $4.0 billion as of the closing date of the EnLink Acquisition.  EnLink is now a wholly owned subsidiary.\nMedallion Acquisition \n- On Oct. 31, 2024, we completed the Medallion Acquisition with GIP, acquiring all of the equity interests in Medallion for total consideration of $2.6 billion, inclusive of the purchase of additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party.  We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.  This acquisition expands our midstream services for crude oil and condensate in West Texas, specifically in the Midland Basin.  Financial results and operating information related to the Medallion Acquisition impacts our Refined Products and Crude segment and is included with \"Financial Results and Operating Information\" for the period Nov. 1, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024.\nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Divestiture\n - On Dec. 31, 2024, we completed sale of three of our wholly owned interstate natural gas pipeline systems to DT Midstream, Inc. for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion, and recognized a gain of $227 million.  With a portion of the proceeds of the sale, we repaid the Guardian Term Loan Agreement and the Viking Term Loan Agreement.  This transaction aligns and enhances our capital allocation priorities within our integrated value chain. \nGulf Coast NGL Pipelines Acquisition\n - On June 17, 2024, we completed the acquisition of a system of NGL pipelines from Easton Energy, a Houston-based midstream company, for approximately $280 million.  This acquisition in our Natural Gas Liquids segment includes approximately 450 miles of liquids products pipelines located in the strategic Gulf Coast market centers for NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.  A portion of the Easton assets are already connected to our Mont Belvieu assets.  We expect to add connections to our Houston-based assets beginning in mid-2025 through the end of 2025.\nFor additional information on our most recent acquisitions and divestiture, see Part II, Item 8, Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  See Part 1, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks related to these transactions. \nJoint Ventures\n - On Feb. 4, 2025, we entered into definitive agreements to form joint ventures with MPLX LP (MPLX) to construct a 400 MBbl/d liquified petroleum gas export terminal in Texas City, Texas, and a new 24-inch pipeline from our Mont Belvieu, Texas, storage facility to the new terminal.  Texas City Logistics LLC, the export terminal joint venture, is owned 50% by us and 50% by MPLX, with MPLX constructing and operating the facility.  MBTC Pipeline LLC, the pipeline joint venture, is owned 80% by us and 20% by MPLX, and we will construct and operate the pipeline.  We expect to invest approximately $1.0 billion in these projects.  \n47\nTable of Contents\nMarket Condition\n - Earnings increased in 2024, compared with 2023, due primarily to a full year of earnings from our new Refined Products and Crude segment, higher NGL and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and the impact of the interstate pipeline divestiture in the Natural Gas Pipelines segment.  Our extensive and integrated assets are located in, and connected with, some of the most productive shale basins, as well as refineries and demand centers, in the United States.  \nCapital Projects \n- Our primary capital projects are outlined in the table below: \nProject\nScope\nApproximate\nCosts (a)\nExpected Completion\nNatural Gas Liquids\n(In millions)\nMB-6 fractionator\n125 MBbl/d NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas\n$550\nCompleted\nWest Texas NGL pipeline expansion\nIncrease capacity via pipeline looping in the Permian Basin\n$520\nCompleted\nElk Creek pipeline expansion\nIncrease capacity to 435 MBbl/d out of the Rocky Mountain region\n$355\nCompleted (b)\nMedford fractionator\nRebuild our 210 MBbl/d NGL fractionation facility in Medford, Oklahoma\n$385\n(c)\nRefined Products and Crude\nGreater Denver pipeline expansion\nIncrease total system capacity by 35 MBbl/d and additional expansion capabilities\n$480\nMid-2026\n(a) - Excludes capitalized interest/AFUDC.\n(b) - We completed construction in January 2025, and the project is partially in service.  Following supply of full power, expected in mid-2025, we will reach the full capacity of 435 MBbl/d.\n(c) - This project is expected to be completed in two phases, with the first phase expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026, and the second phase completed in the first quarter of 2027.\nIn our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, we have a capital project to relocate a 150 MMcf/d processing plant to the Permian Basin from North Texas, which we expect to be in service in the first quarter of 2026. \nDebt Issuances\n - In September 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of $1.25 billion, 4.25% senior notes due 2027; $600 million, 4.4% senior notes due 2029; $1.25 billion, 4.75% senior notes due 2031; $1.6 billion, 5.05% senior notes due 2034; $1.5 billion, 5.7% senior notes due 2054; and $800 million, 5.85% senior notes due 2064.  The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $6.9 billion.  The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and the Medallion Acquisition, purchase additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party, to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisitions and to repay outstanding indebtedness.\nDebt Repayments\n - In December 2024, we redeemed our $500 million, 4.9% senior notes due March 2025 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.\nIn September 2024, we repaid the remaining $484 million of our $500 million, 2.75% senior notes at maturity with cash on hand.\nShare Repurchase Program\n - In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.  We expect shares to be acquired from time to time in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.  We expect any purchases to be funded by cash on hand, cash flow from operations and short-term borrowings.  The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $2.0 billion of common stock or on Jan. 1, 2029, whichever occurs first.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, we repurchased 1.675 million shares for $172 million under the program.\nDividends\n - During 2024, we paid common stock dividends totaling $3.96 per share, an increase of 3.7% compared to the 2023 dividend of $3.82 per share.  In February 2025, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.03 per share ($4.12 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 4% compared with the same quarter in the prior year.  Our dividend growth is due primarily to the increase in cash flows resulting from the growth of our operations.  The quarterly stock dividend was paid on Feb. 14, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 3, 2025. \n48\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nManagement uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance.  Our consolidated financial metrics include: (1) operating income; (2) net income; (3) diluted EPS; and (4) adjusted EBITDA.  We evaluate segment operating results using adjusted EBITDA and our operating metrics, which include various volume and rate statistics that are relevant for the respective segment.  These operating metrics allow investors to analyze the various components of segment financial results in terms of volumes and rate/price.  Management uses these metrics to analyze historical segment financial results and as the key inputs for forecasting and budgeting segment financial results.  For additional information on our operating metrics, see the respective segment subsections of this “Financial Results and Operating Information” section.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n - Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of our financial performance.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense and certain other noncash items.  Following the Magellan Acquisition, we performed a review of our calculation methodology of adjusted EBITDA and, beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation to include the adjusted EBITDA related to our unconsolidated affiliates using the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in net earnings from investments.  In prior periods, our calculation included equity in net earnings from investments.  This change resulted in an additional $62 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods.  Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated consistently with the definition above and excludes items such as interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and other noncash items.  Although the amounts related to our unconsolidated affiliates are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues, expenses or cash flows of such unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in our industry as a measurement of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare financial performance among companies in our industry.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, EPS or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.

However, ethane volumes may experience growth or decline greater than corresponding growth or decline in overall NGL production due to ethane economics causing producers to recover or reject ethane. \n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 vs. 2023\n - While exchange services earnings increased, volumes decreased in 2024 due primarily to the expiration of low-margin contracts in the prior year and lower volumes in the Permian Basin, offset partially by increased production in the Rocky Mountain region at higher fee rates.\nNatural Gas Pipelines\nCapital Projects\n - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment invests in capital projects that provide transportation and storage services to end users.  We recently reactivated previously idled storage facilities with 3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity in Texas.  In addition, we are in the process of expanding our storage injection capabilities in Oklahoma, adding 4 Bcf of working gas storage capacity, which we expect to be complete in the second quarter of 2025.\nFor a discussion of our capital expenditure financing, see “Capital Expenditures” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.\nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Divestiture\n - On Nov. 19, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with DT Midstream, Inc. to sell three of our wholly owned interstate natural gas pipeline systems.

In prior periods, our calculation included equity in net earnings from investments.  This change resulted in an additional $62 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods.\n(b) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes $633 million related to the Medford incident, including a settlement gain of $779 million, offset partially by $146 million of third-party fractionation costs.\n(c) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2024 includes transaction costs related primarily to the EnLink Acquisitions and Medallion Acquisition of $73 million, offset partially by interest income of $39 million.  The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes transaction costs related to the Magellan Acquisition of $158 million, offset partially by interest income of $49 million and net gains of $41 million on extinguishment of debt related to open market repurchases.  \n(d) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2024, includes a gain of $227 million from the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture.\n(e) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes segment adjusted EBITDA for the period Sept. 25, 2023, through Dec. 31, 2023.\nCONTINGENCIES\nSee Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for a discussion of regulatory and legal matters.\nOther Legal Proceedings\n - We are a party to various legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of our operations.  While the results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, are not material.  Additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\n - Our primary sources of cash inflows are operating cash flows, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, debt issuances and the issuance of common stock for our liquidity and capital resources requirements.\nWe expect our sources of cash inflows to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends, maturities of long-term debt, share repurchases and contributions to unconsolidated affiliates.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity due to our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2030, and access to $1.0 billion available through our “at-the-market” equity program.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, no shares have been sold through our “at-the-market” equity program.\n55\nTable of Contents\nWe may manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt, Treasury locks and interest-rate swaps.  For additional information on our interest-rate swaps, see Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nCash Management\n - At Dec. 31, 2024, we had $733 million of cash and cash equivalents.  For our wholly owned subsidiaries, we use a centralized cash management program that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned nonguarantor operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees.  Our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group.  Our operating subsidiaries participate in this program to the extent they are permitted pursuant to FERC regulations or their operating agreements.  Under the cash management program, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we provide cash to the subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to us.\nIn December 2024, we entered into an agreement to provide revolving unsecured loans to EnLink through a promissory note at an interest rate of 4.85% at Dec. 31, 2024.  This is a floating rate agreement which bears interest at ONEOK’s current short-term borrowing rate plus 0.25%.  At Dec. 31, 2024, we held a promissory note receivable of $510 million, which was eliminated in consolidation.  Interest earned on this agreement was not material.  Following the EnLink Acquisition, completed on Jan. 31, 2025, we effectively terminated this agreement as EnLink operating subsidiaries are wholly owned and now participate in the cash management program described above.\nGuarantees\n - ONEOK, ONEOK Partners, the Intermediate Partnership and Magellan (Obligated Group) have cross guarantees in place for ONEOK’s and ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness.  These guarantees in place for our and ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of outstanding securities.  Liabilities under the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.  The Intermediate Partnership holds all of ONEOK Partners’ interests and equity in its subsidiaries, which are nonguarantors, and substantially all the assets and operations reside with nonguarantor operating subsidiaries.  Magellan holds interests in its subsidiaries, which are nonguarantors, and substantially all the assets and operations reside with nonguarantor operating subsidiaries.  \nAt Dec. 31, 2024, EnLink was a subsidiary of ONEOK, but did not guarantee ONEOK’s or ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness and was excluded from the Obligated Group.  EnLink and EnLink Partners also had outstanding debt securities that were not guaranteed by ONEOK as of Dec. 31, 2024.  At the completion of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, ONEOK assumed the outstanding debt of EnLink and EnLink Partners (the Assumed Debt) such that EnLink and EnLink Partners were each released from all debt obligations, and provided a guarantee for our and ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness to the holders of each series of outstanding securities, including for the Assumed Debt.  EnLink and EnLink Partners are now included in the Obligated Group.  As of the date of this report, the combined financial information of subsidiary issuers and parent guarantors, excluding our ownership of all interest in ONEOK Partners, Magellan and EnLink, reflect no material assets or liabilities or results of operations, apart from guaranteed indebtedness and therefore, we have excluded the summarized financial information for each issuer and guarantor.  \nFor additional information on our indebtedness, please see Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nShort-term Liquidity\n - Our principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, distributions received from our unconsolidated affiliates, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our recently executed $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement.  In February 2025, we amended and restated our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement to increase the size to $3.5 billion, extend the term to February 2030 and make other non-material modifications.  All other terms and conditions remain substantially the same.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, we had no borrowings under our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, and we are in compliance with all covenants.  Upon closing of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility was terminated.  \nWe had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $481 million and $344 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, and Dec. 31, 2023, respectively, due primarily to current maturities of long-term debt.  Generally, our working capital is influenced by several factors, including, among other things: (i) the timing of (a) debt and equity issuances, (b) the funding of capital expenditures, (c) scheduled debt payments, and (d) accounts receivable and payable; and (ii) the volume and cost of inventory and commodity imbalances.  We may have working capital deficits in future periods as our long-term debt becomes current.  We do not expect a working capital deficit of this nature to have a material adverse impact to our cash flows or operations.\n56\nTable of Contents\nFor additional information on our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, see Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. \nLong-term Financing\n - In addition to our principal sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, we expect to fund our longer-term financing requirements by issuing long-term notes, as needed.  Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuing common stock, loans from financial institutions, issuance of convertible debt securities or preferred equity securities, asset securitization and the sale and lease-back of facilities.\nWe may, at any time, seek to retire or purchase our or ONEOK Partners’ outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Such repurchases and exchanges, if any, will be on such terms and prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, or liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.  The amounts involved may be material.\nDebt Issuances\n - In September 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of senior notes of the following tenors: $1.25 billion, 4.25% senior notes due 2027; $600 million, 4.4% senior notes due 2029; $1.25 billion, 4.75% senior notes due 2031; $1.6 billion, 5.05% senior notes due 2034; $1.5 billion, 5.7% senior notes due 2054; and $800 million, 5.85% senior notes due 2064.  The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $6.9 billion.  The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and the Medallion Acquisition, purchase additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party, to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisitions and to repay outstanding indebtedness.\nDebt Repayments\n - In December 2024, we repaid $120 million of borrowings under the Guardian Term Loan Agreement and $60 million of borrowings under the Viking Term Loan Agreement, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand, as part of the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture.\nIn December 2024, we redeemed our $500 million, 4.9% senior notes due March 2025 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.\nSubsequent to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we repaid $465 million of borrowings under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility with cash on hand.\nSubsequent to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we repaid $374 million of borrowings under the EnLink AR Facility with cash on hand and terminated the EnLink AR Facility. \nIn September 2024, we repaid the remaining $484 million of our $500 million, 2.75% senior notes at maturity with cash on hand.\nEquity\n - On Jan. 31, 2025, we completed the EnLink Acquisition.  Pursuant to the EnLink Merger Agreement, each common unit of EnLink was exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.1412 shares of ONEOK Common stock, including EnLink Units that were exchanged for all previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units immediately prior to closing.  We issued 41 million shares of common stock, with a fair value of $4.0 billion.  There are no remaining Series B Preferred Units outstanding.\nOn Oct. 17, 2024, EnLink redeemed all outstanding Series C Preferred Units at $1,000 per Series C Preferred Unit, plus $8.28 per Series C Preferred Unit of unpaid distributions, for $365 million with proceeds received from borrowings under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility.  As of Dec. 31. 2024, there are no remaining Series C Preferred Units outstanding. \nShare Repurchase Program\n - In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.  We expect shares to be acquired from time to time in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, we have repurchased 1.675 million shares for $172 million under the program with cash on hand.  The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $2.0 billion of common stock or on Jan. 1, 2029, whichever occurs first. \nMaterial Commitments\n - We have material cash commitments related to our capital expenditures, senior notes and corresponding interest payments, which we expect to fund through our sources of cash inflows discussed above.  Our senior notes and interest payments are discussed in Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  We also have cash commitments related to transportation, storage and other commercial contracts, as well as our financial and physical derivative obligations, which we expect to fund with cash from operations.\n57\nTable of Contents\nCapital Expenditures\n \n- We proactively monitor lead times on materials and equipment used in constructing capital projects, and we enter into procurement agreements for long-lead items for potential projects to plan for future growth.  Our capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows and short- and long-term debt.\nThe following table sets forth our capital expenditures, excluding the equity portion of AFUDC, for the periods indicated:\nCapital Expenditures\n2024 (a)\n2023\n2022\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing\n$\n492\n \n$\n448 \n$\n445 \nNatural Gas Liquids\n987\n \n818 \n581 \nNatural Gas Pipelines\n258\n \n228 \n123 \nRefined Products and Crude (b)\n216\n \n52 \n— \nOther\n68\n \n49 \n53 \nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n2,021\n \n$\n1,595 \n$\n1,202 \n(a) \n- \nIncludes capital expenditures for EnLink and Medallion for the period Oct. 15, 2024, and Nov. 1, 2024, through Dec. 31, 2024, respectively.\n(b) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes capital expenditures for the period Sept. 25, 2023, through Dec. 31, 2023.\nCapital expenditures increased in 2024, compared with 2023, due primarily to our capital projects, including our MB-6 fractionator and the NGL and Refined Products and Crude pipeline expansion projects.  See discussion of our announced capital projects in the “Recent Developments” section. \nWe expect total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC and capitalized interest, of $2.8 - $3.2 billion in 2025. \nCredit Ratings\n - Our long-term debt credit ratings as of Feb. 17, 2025, are shown in the table below:\nRating Agency\nLong-Term Rating\nShort-Term Rating\nOutlook\nMoody’s\nBaa2\nPrime-2\nStable\nS&P\nBBB\nA-2\nStable\nFitch\nBBB\nF2\nStable\nOur credit ratings, which are investment grade, may be affected by our leverage, liquidity, credit profile or potential transactions.  The most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, interest coverage, business risk profile and liquidity.  If our credit ratings were downgraded, our cost to borrow funds under our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement would increase, and a potential loss of access to the commercial paper market could occur.  In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we would continue to have access to our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in 2030.  An adverse credit rating change alone is not a default under our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement.\nIn the normal course of business, our counterparties provide us with secured and unsecured credit.  In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings or a significant change in our counterparties’ evaluation of our creditworthiness, we could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties.  We may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments.\nDividends\n - Holders of our common stock share equally in any common stock dividends declared by our Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding preferred stock.  In 2024, we paid common stock dividends totaling $3.96 per share, an increase of 3.7% compared to the 2023 dividend of $3.82 per share.  In February 2025, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.03 per share ($4.12 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 4% compared with the same quarter in the prior year.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, our cash flows from operations exceeded dividends paid by $2.6 billion.  We expect our cash flows from operations to continue to sufficiently fund our cash dividends.  To the extent operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund our dividends, we may utilize cash on hand from other sources of short- and long-term liquidity to fund a portion of our dividends.\n58\nTable of Contents\nCASH FLOW ANALYSIS\nWe use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that affect net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period and for operating cash items that do not impact net income.  These reconciling items can include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of business and assets, net undistributed earnings from equity-method investments, share-based compensation expense, other amounts and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities.\nThe following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:\n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\n \n \nOperating activities\n$\n4,888\n \n$\n4,421 \n$\n2,906 \nInvesting activities\n(6,612)\n(6,404)\n(1,139)\nFinancing activities\n2,119\n \n2,101 \n(1,693)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents\n395\n \n118 \n74 \nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n338\n \n220 \n146 \nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$\n733\n \n$\n338 \n$\n220 \nOperating Cash Flows\n - Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  Changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows.  Our operating cash flows can also be impacted by changes in our inventory balances, which are driven primarily by commodity prices, supply, demand and the operation of our assets.\n2024 vs. 2023\n - Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased $868 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, due primarily to the impact of the Magellan Acquisition in our Refined Products and Crude segment, as discussed in “Financial Results and Operating Information” offset partially by insurance proceeds received from the Medford settlement in 2023.  \nThe changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $43 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, compared with an increase of $358 million for the same period in 2023.  This change is due primarily to changes in our legal reserve liability as discussed in Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report, changes in risk management assets and liabilities and changes in accounts receivable resulting from the receipts of cash from counterparties and from inventory, both of which varies from period to period, and with changes in commodity prices.  These changes were offset partially by changes in accounts payable, which vary from period to period with changes in commodity prices and from the timing of payments to vendors, suppliers and other third parties.\nInvesting Cash Flows \n2024 vs. 2023\n - Cash used in investing activities for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, increased $208 million, compared with the same period in 2023, due primarily to cash paid to acquire EnLink and Medallion, capital expenditures related to our capital projects in 2024 and insurance proceeds received from the Medford settlement in 2023, offset partially by proceeds received from the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture.\nFinancing Cash Flows \n2024 vs. 2023\n - Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, increased $18 million compared with the same period in 2023, due primarily to the increase in issuance of senior unsecured notes associated with acquisitions, offset by increased repayments of long-term debt in 2024, including the repayment of the Viking and Guardian Term Loan Agreements and the outstanding borrowings on the EnLink Revolving Credit facility and the EnLink AR Facility, increased dividends paid in 2024 and the repurchase of EnLink’s Series C Preferred Units. \n59\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow Analysis for the Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 vs. 2022\n - The cash flow analysis for the year ended Dec. 31, 2023, compared with the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, is included in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available via the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.oneok.com.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nInformation about the impact of new accounting standards is included in Note A\n \nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.\nThe following is a summary of our most critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those estimates most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters.  We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for the description of our accounting policies.\nFair Value Estimates in Business Combination Accounting\n - Business combination accounting requires that assets and liabilities be recorded at their estimated fair value in connection with the initial recognition of the transaction.  Estimating the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with business combination accounting requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments, and in some cases management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those estimates.\nIn order to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we utilized widely accepted valuation techniques that included discounted cash flow and cost methods.  The discounted cash flow method utilizes assumptions that include, but are not limited to, estimated future cash flows, commodity margin growth rates, discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows, estimated rates of return and estimated customer attrition rates.  Cost methods estimate the fair value of assets based on the estimated construction or replacement cost of the assets and requires the use of various inputs and assumptions.  While we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to estimate the fair value, these assumptions are inherently uncertain.  An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in our assumptions is not practicable given the numerous assumptions, and their interdependence, that can materially affect our estimates.\nThe purchase price allocation recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available. \nSee Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of business combinations. \nDerivatives and Risk-management Activities\n - We utilize derivatives to reduce our market-risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations and to achieve more predictable cash flows.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship.  When possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.  We have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes.  For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss from a change in fair value of the derivative instrument is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which time the fair value of the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings. \nWe assess hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter, to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective.  We do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations, as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for \n60\nTable of Contents\nas effective cash flow hedges.  However, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for cash flow hedge accounting or if we fail to appropriately designate it as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently in earnings.  Additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings.  For more information on commodity price sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nSee Notes A, D and E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of fair value measurements and derivatives and risk-management activities.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Equity Method Investments\n - We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of July 1, unless events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time.  As part of our goodwill impairment test, we may first assess qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount.  If further testing is necessary, or a quantitative test is elected, we perform a Step 1 analysis for goodwill impairment.\nIn a Step 1 analysis, an assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  \nWe assess our long-lived asset groups, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group.  If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset group. \nWe evaluate equity method investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there is an other-than-temporary loss in value of the investment.  When evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized in our consolidated financial statements as an impairment charge.\nOur impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates, such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies.  To estimate undiscounted future cash flows of long-lived assets we may apply a probability-weighted approach that incorporates different assumptions and potential outcomes related to the underlying long-lived assets.  The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist.  To estimate the fair value of these assets, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach.  Under the income approach, our discounted cash flow analysis includes the following inputs that are not readily available: a discount rate reflective of industry cost of capital, our estimated contract rates, volumes, operating margins, operating and maintenance costs and capital expenditures.  Under the market approach, our inputs include EBITDA multiples, which are estimated from recent peer acquisition transactions, and forecasted EBITDA, which incorporates inputs similar to those used under the income approach.  If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges.\nSee Notes A, F, G and O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates.\nDepreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\n - Our property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method that incorporates management assumptions regarding useful economic lives and residual values.  As we place additional assets in service or acquire assets as a result of an acquisition or asset purchase, our estimates related to depreciation expense have become more significant and changes in estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material effect on our results of operations.  At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation expense prospectively.  Examples of such circumstances include changes in (i) competition, (ii) laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (iii) technology that render an asset obsolete, (iv) expected salvage values, (v) results of rate cases or rate settlements on regulated assets and (vi) forecasts of the remaining economic life for the resource basins where our assets are located, if any.  For the fiscal years presented in this Form 10-K, no \n61\nTable of Contents\nchanges were made to the determinations of useful lives that would have a material effect on the timing of depreciation expense in future periods.\nSee Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of property, plant and equipment.",
