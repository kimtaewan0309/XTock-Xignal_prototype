We unlock financial technology to the world across the money lifecycle underpinning the world's financial systems. Our people are dedicated to advancing the way the world pays, banks and invests, by helping our clients to confidently run, grow and protect their businesses. Our expertise comes from decades of experience helping financial institutions and businesses of all sizes adapt to meet the needs of their customers by harnessing where reliability meets innovation in financial technology. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS is a member of the Fortune 500® and the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index. FIS is incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., and our stock is traded under the trading symbol \"FIS\" on the New York Stock Exchange.\nGrowth and Strategy Objectives\nOur growth has been driven by a number of factors, including growth of our customers' businesses, our internal development of new solutions that enhance our client offerings, and our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and addressable markets. Acquisitions have also contributed additional solutions that complement or enhance our offerings, diversify our client base, expand our geographic coverage, and provide entry into new and attractive adjacent markets that align with our strategic objectives. We continue to strategically allocate resources to both internal and external growth initiatives to enhance the long-term value of our business. \nWorldpay Sale Summary\nOn January 31, 2024, we completed the sale (the \"Worldpay Sale\") of a 55% equity interest in our Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to private equity funds managed by GTCR, LLC (such funds, the \"Buyer\"). FIS retained a non-controlling 45% equity interest in a new standalone joint venture, Worldpay Holdco, LLC (\"Worldpay\"), following the closing of the Worldpay Sale. Worldpay continues to provide merchant acquiring and related services to businesses of all sizes and across any industry globally, enabling them to accept, authorize and settle electronic payment transactions. In connection with the Worldpay Sale, FIS and Worldpay entered into commercial agreements, preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and reducing potential dis-synergies. FIS and Worldpay also entered into additional agreements as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe our competitive strengths include the following:\n•\nBrand. \nFIS is a highly respected brand known globally for innovation and thought leadership in the financial services sector. \n•\nExtensive Domain Expertise and Portfolio Breadth. \nFIS' significant expertise in the markets and domains we serve enables us to deliver a broad range of innovative software applications and flexible service offerings, ranging from managed processing arrangements, either at the client site or hosted at an FIS data center or in our private cloud, to traditional license and maintenance arrangements. Our expansive solution set allows us to bundle tailored or integrated services to compete effectively. \n•\nExcellent and Long-term Relationships with Clients. \nA significant percentage of our business relates to solutions provided under multi-year, recurring contracts. The nature of these relationships allows us to develop close partnerships with our clients, resulting in high client retention rates. As the breadth of FIS' service offerings has \n2\nTable of \nContents\nexpanded, we have found that our deep and broad access within our clients' organizations presents greater opportunities for cross-selling and up-selling solutions to our clients. \n•\nModern and Cloud-based Technologies.\n FIS leverages the modern architectures of our software applications and our ability to integrate many of our solutions with the solutions of others to provide customized solutions that respond to individualized client needs. We have made significant investment in modernizing our platforms and solutions and have moved substantially all of our server compute into our private cloud located in our strategic data centers, supplemented by public clouds in certain regions, to increase speed of delivery to clients and increase solution availability to industry-best levels. \n•\nGlobal\n \nDistribution and Scale. \nWe are a global leader in many of the markets we serve, supported by a large, knowledgeable talent pool of employees around the world. Our worldwide presence and global scale enable us to leverage our array of solution offerings, client relationships, and modern infrastructure to drive revenue growth and operating efficiency.\nStrategy\nOur mission is to deliver superior solutions to our clients and to expand our client base to generate sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strategy to achieve this goal is built on the following pillars:\n•\nBuild, Buy, or Partner to Add Solutions to Win New Clients and Cross-sell to Existing Clients. \nWe continue to invest in our solution portfolio through internal software development, as well as through acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities, providing us with additional solutions to cross-sell to current clients and to capture the interest of new clients. By investing in solution innovation, we continue to expand our value proposition to our clients and prospects.\n•\nSupport Our Clients Through Innovation. \nChanging market dynamics, particularly in the areas of digital delivery, information security and regulation, are transforming the way our clients operate, which is driving incremental demand for our integrated solutions built around our intellectual property. As clients and prospects evaluate technology, business process changes and vendor risks, our depth of service capabilities enables us to become involved earlier in their planning and design process and assist them as they manage these changes.\n•\nDrive Efficiency and Scalability.\n We strive to improve the efficiency of our operations through investments in new technologies, processes and infrastructure modernization. We also leverage a one-to-many operating model to drive high incremental margins on revenue growth, while also providing cost-effective solutions for our clients.\n•\nExpand Distribution.\n Through our global sales force and strategic commercial partnerships, we drive growth through client additions and the expansion of existing client relationships in support of our clients' growth ambitions. Our clients range from large banks, financial institutions and other enterprises, including multi-national clients, to community or regional financial institutions and other businesses.\n•\nAllocate Our Capital and Resources Strategically. \nAs we make decisions with respect to building, buying or partnering to drive innovation in support of our clients, we prioritize the allocation of capital and other resources to the opportunities providing the highest client benefit and growth potential. We also continually review our portfolio of assets and businesses to assess their fit with our strategy and will, from time to time, decide to wind down or divest businesses or assets to redeploy capital to our areas of strategic focus. We believe that keeping our team and our capital strategically focused benefits our existing clients and our ability to win new clients. At the same time, to the extent our businesses generate excess cash, we strategically use it to repurchase shares, repay debt, pay dividends or for other corporate purposes.\nSegment Information\nFIS reports its financial performance based on the following segments: Banking Solutions (\"Banking\"), Capital Market Solutions (\"Capital Markets\") and Corporate and Other. \nThe Worldpay Merchant Solutions business included the former Merchant Solutions segment in addition to a business previously included in the Corporate and Other segment. The results of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business have been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, the Company no longer reports the Merchant Solutions \n3\nTable of \nContents\nsegment. The assets and liabilities of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business disposal group are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets, and the operating results have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As such, the related results have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results. See Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Worldpay Merchant Solutions disposal group and its discontinued operations. FIS' share of the net income of Worldpay is reported as equity method investment earnings (loss).\nAs a result of our ongoing portfolio assessments, the Company reclassified certain businesses from Capital Markets to Banking and to Corporate and Other during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and reclassified certain non-strategic operations from Banking to Corporate and Other during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company recast all prior-period segment information presented to reflect these reclassifications. See \"Segment Information\" below for additional discussion of our solutions and customers. See also Notes 6 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segment revenue.\nOur consolidated results generally do not reflect pronounced seasonality. However, quarterly revenue and margins for each segment may vary based on the timing of recognition of certain non-recurring revenue, including software licenses and termination fees.\nFor information about current trends in market demand, see \"Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n.\n\"\nRevenue by Segment\nThe table below summarizes our revenue by reporting segment (in millions):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBanking Solutions (1)\n$\n6,892 \n$\n6,743 \n$\n6,625 \nCapital Market Solutions\n2,979 \n2,766 \n2,631 \nCorporate and Other\n256 \n322 \n464 \nTotal Consolidated Revenue\n$\n10,127 \n$\n9,831 \n$\n9,720 \n(1)\nDuring 2024, the Company revised its previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the annual periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, to correct certain immaterial misstatements. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our revision of prior-period consolidated financial statements.\nBanking Solutions (\"Banking\")\nThe Banking segment is focused on serving financial institutions with core processing software, transaction processing software and complementary applications and services, many of which interact directly with core processing software. We sell these solutions on either a bundled or stand-alone basis. Clients in this segment include global financial institutions, U.S. regional and community banks, credit unions and commercial lenders, as well as government institutions and other commercial organizations. We provide our clients integrated solutions characterized by multi-year processing contracts that generate recurring revenue. The predictable nature of cash flows generated from the Banking segment provides opportunities for further investments in innovation, integration, information and security, and compliance in a cost-effective manner.\nOur solutions in this segment include the following:\n•\nCore Processing and Ancillary Applications.\n Our core processing software applications, including deposit and lending, customer management and other central management systems, are designed to run banking processes for our financial institution clients. Clients use these applications to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts. Our diverse selection of market-focused core processing software applications enables FIS to compete effectively in a wide range of markets. We continue to invest in our core modernization efforts to further differentiate our offerings for the long term. We also offer a number of solutions that are ancillary to the primary applications listed above, including branch automation, back-office support systems and compliance support.\n•\nDigital, including Mobile and Online.\n Our comprehensive suite of retail and commercial applications enables financial institutions to streamline and integrate customer-facing operations with back-office processes, thereby improving customer experience across channels (e.g., branch, internet, mobile, ATM, and call centers). FIS' focus on real-time consumer access has driven significant market innovation in multi-channel, API-enabled embedded and multi-hosted solutions, underpinned by a strategy that provides tight integration and a seamless customer experience. \nOur innovative digital banking capabilities are now available to financial institutions with continually expanding \n4\nTable of \nContents\nfunctionality. Our digital offerings are\n integrated with core banking platforms offered by FIS and are also offered to customers of non-FIS core systems.\n•\nFraud, Risk Management and Compliance.\n Our decision solutions offer a spectrum of options that cover the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account applicants to managing existing customer accounts and fraud. Our applications enable Know Your Customer, new account decisioning and opening, account and transaction management, fraud management and collections. Our risk management solutions use our proprietary risk management models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new account. Our systems use a combination of advanced authentication procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit, card and other transactions for financial institutions.\n•\nCard and Retail Payments.\n Our card and retail payment technology solutions allow clients to issue VISA\n®\n, MasterCard\n®\n or other payment network-branded credit and debit cards or other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. Card-based volumes continue to increase, driven by both the number of transactions per month and the value of those transactions. We offer EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) integrated circuit cards, often referred to as chip cards, as well as a variety of stored-value card types and loyalty programs, including our Premium Payback service that allows our financial institutions' customers to use loyalty points at a variety of merchant point-of-sale systems. Our integrated solutions range from card production and activation to processing to an extensive range of fraud management solutions and value-added loyalty programs designed to increase card usage and fee-based revenue for financial institutions and merchants. The majority of our programs are full service, including most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to operate a credit card program. We do not make credit decisions for our card issuing clients. We are also a leading provider of prepaid card solutions, which include digital cards, gift cards and reloadable cards, with end-to-end solutions for the development, processing and administration of stored-value programs, including government benefit programs. Our closed-loop gift card solutions and loyalty programs provide merchants compelling solutions to drive consumer loyalty.\n•\nElectronic Funds Transfer and Network.\n Our electronic funds transfer and debit card processing businesses offer settlement and card management solutions for financial institution card issuers. We offer a modern, core-agnostic payment hub with real-time fraud monitoring across payment rails. We own and operate several U.S. domestic debit, prepaid, ATM and credit networks that carry transactions for a variety of transaction modes. Our networks connect millions of cards and point-of-sale locations nationwide, providing consumers with secure, real-time access to their money. Also through our networks, clients such as financial institutions, retailers and independent ATM operators can capitalize on the efficiency, consumer convenience and security of electronic real-time payments, real-time account-to-account transfers, and strategic alliances, such as surcharge-free ATM network arrangements.\n•\nWealth and Retirement.\n We provide wealth and retirement solutions that help banks, trust companies, brokerage firms, insurance firms, retirement plan professionals, benefit administrators and independent advisors acquire, service and grow their client relationships. We provide solutions for client acquisition, transaction management, trust accounting and recordkeeping that can be deployed stand-alone, as part of an integrated wealth or retirement platform, or on an outsourced basis.\n•\nItem Processing and Output Solutions.\n Our item processing solutions furnish financial institutions with the technology needed to capture data from checks, transaction tickets and other items; image and sort items; process exceptions through keying; and perform balancing, archiving and the production of statements. Our item processing services are performed at one of our multiple item processing centers located throughout the U.S. or on-site at client locations. Our extensive solutions include distributed (i.e., non-centralized) data capture, mobile deposit capture, check and remittance processing, fraud detection, and document and report management. Clients encompass banks and corporations of all sizes, from de novo banks to the largest financial institutions and corporations. We offer a number of output solutions that are ancillary to the primary solutions we provide, including print and mail capabilities, document composition software and solutions, and card personalization fulfillment solutions. Our print and mail solutions offer complete computer output solutions for the creation, management and delivery of print and fulfillment needs. We provide our card personalization fulfillment solutions for branded credit cards and branded and non-branded debit and prepaid cards.\n5\nTable of \nContents\nCapital Market Solutions (\"Capital Markets\")\nThe Capital Markets segment is focused on serving global financial services clients and corporations with a broad array of buy- and sell-side, treasury, risk management and lending solutions. Clients in this segment include asset managers, private equity firms, sell-side securities brokerage and trading firms, insurers, asset and auto financiers and other commercial organizations. Our solutions include a variety of mission-critical buy- and sell-side applications for recordkeeping, data and analytics, trading and financing, as well as corporate treasury and risk management applications. Capital Markets clients purchase our solutions in various ways including licensing and managing technology \"in-house,\" using consulting and third-party service providers, as well as procuring fully outsourced end-to-end solutions. Our long-established relationships with many of these financial and commercial institutions generate significant recurring revenue. We have made, and continue to make, investments in modern platforms, advanced technologies, open APIs, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and regulatory technology to support our Capital Markets clients.\nOur solutions in this segment include the following:\n•\nTrading and Asset Services. \nWe offer solutions that support our customers across the buy and sell sides of the capital markets industry, assisting them to control their front, middle and back office operations through integrated ecosystems. Our solutions support institutional investors, managers, broker-dealers, asset servicers and transfer agents across all asset classes including private equity, hedge, credit, and traditional. Our trading applications focus on advanced trade life-cycle management, including market making and risk management, cleared derivatives processing, securities processing and securities finance, tax processing, and regulatory compliance, including anti-money laundering (AML) and trade surveillance. Our Asset Servicing solutions support every stage of the investment process, from research and portfolio management to order and position management, valuation, risk management, corporate actions, reconciliation, investment accounting, investor accounting, transfer agency and client reporting. Our solutions improve both investment decision making and operational efficiency, while managing risk and increasing transparency across the industry.\n•\nLending\n. Our lending solutions offer full life-cycle commercial lending functionality from loan origination, commercial credit assessment and customer risk rating to loan servicing and data analytics. We also offer the leveraged and syndicated loan markets solutions that manage amendments, secondary market trading, deal management and bookrunning. In the asset finance space, we offer a single, end-to-end leasing platform that helps auto and equipment finance companies manage the entire financing process, supporting origination and pricing, credit decisioning, contract management, servicing and collections.\n•\nTreasury and Risk. \nOur treasury solutions help chief financial officers and treasurers manage working capital by reducing risk and improving communication and response time between a company's buyers, suppliers, banks, and other stakeholders. Our end-to-end financial management framework helps bring together receivables, treasury, and payments for a single view of cash and risk, which helps our clients optimize business processes for enhanced liquidity management. Our risk portfolio of solutions manages market and credit risk and regulatory compliance for banks and actuarial risk for insurance firms.\nCorporate and Other\nThe Corporate and Other segment consists of corporate overhead expense, certain leveraged functions and miscellaneous expenses that are not included in the operating segments, as well as certain non-strategic businesses that we plan to wind down or sell. The overhead and leveraged costs relate to corporate marketing, finance, accounting, human resources, legal, compliance and internal audit functions, as well as other costs, such as acquisition, integration and transformation-related expenses and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, that are not considered when management evaluates revenue-generating segment performance. Our other operating income recorded in connection with our transaction services arrangements with Worldpay is also recorded in Corporate and Other. \nSales and Marketing \nOur sales personnel have expertise in particular solutions, geographic markets and industry verticals, as well as across our various client segments. We believe that focusing our expertise on clients in specific markets and tailoring integrated solution sets to participants in those markets enables us to better serve our clients and makes our offerings more attractive to prospects. The majority of our prospects are identified via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound lead generation, telesales and virtual sales efforts.\n6\nTable of \nContents\nOur global marketing team develops and leads the execution of global, role-specific and geography-based strategic marketing plans in support of the segments' reputation and relationship building goals in addition to their revenue and profitability goals. Key components of our strategic plans include brand amplification and digital enablement; market and competitive research; voice of the customer and client engagement; thought leadership; integrated go-to-market programs; internal communications and readiness; journalists and social media engagement; industry analyst relations; client events; trade shows; high-touch client programs; demand generation campaigns; account- and deal-based marketing programs; collateral development and management across digital and online channels; and the launch of new products to market. \nPatents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property\nIn general, we own the intellectual property and proprietary rights that are necessary to conduct our business and are important to our future success, including trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents. We license certain items from third parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms, including some \"open source\" licenses. \nWe rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trade secrets, copyrights and applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide. We rely on trademark law to protect our rights in our brands. We intend to continue taking commercially reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including by legal action when necessary and appropriate.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our solutions are intensely competitive across both established companies and new industry entrants. Depending on the business line, our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, internal technology or software development departments within financial institutions or other large companies; global and regional companies providing banking, payment and capital markets services; embedded payment solution providers; securities exchanges; asset managers; card associations; clearing networks or associations; trust companies; independent computer services firms; companies that develop verticalized software applications; companies owned by global banks selling competitive solutions; companies that provide customized development, implementation and support services; emerging technology innovators and business process outsourcing companies. Many of these companies compete with us across multiple solutions, market segments and geographies to varying degrees based on solution strength and distribution strength. Competitive factors impacting the success of our solutions include the quality of the technology-based application or service, breadth of application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, the ability to maintain, enhance and support the applications or solutions, price and overall client experience. We believe that we compete vigorously in each of these categories. In addition, we believe our domain expertise and the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio of applications, services and integrated solutions enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings. Our ability to innovate and scale digital payments and solutions has been a competitive advantage as well.\nTechnology Development \nOur technology development activities primarily relate to the modernization of our proprietary core processing software applications and the design and development of next generation digital solutions, processing systems, software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer solutions compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.\nAs part of our technology development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in the evaluation of various new and existing technologies. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. We typically utilize enterprise license agreements or strive to ensure that either alternative suppliers or transfer rights exist in order to ensure the continuity of supply of third-party technology components used in the development of our software applications and service offerings. As a result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party technology components. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions depending on our ability to develop the functionality internally within time and budget constraints. Additionally, third-party software may be used for routine, commonplace functions within a technology platform environment. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introduce technology or infrastructure changes to our solutions.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nGovernment Regulation\nOur solutions are subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, and international regulations and requirements, as well as requirements under the rules of self-regulatory organizations including, without limitation, federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, federal, state and international money transmission laws, state cybersecurity protection laws, data protection and privacy laws, cyber resilience laws, artificial intelligence laws, usury laws, laws governing state trust charters, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Bank Service Company Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the United Kingdom (\"U.K\"). Money Laundering Regulations, the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act, the U.K. Criminal Finances Act, the U.K. Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act, the U.K. Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, European Union (\"E.U.\") Anti-Money Laundering Directives, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\"), anti-corruption laws including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \"FCPA\") and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \"U.K. Bribery Act\"), the rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (\"FFIEC\"), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. (\"FCA\"), the Central Bank of Ireland in the Republic of Ireland (\"CBI\"), the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier in Luxembourg (\"CSSF\"), the Jersey Financial Services Commission in Jersey, Channel Islands (\"JFSC\") and state financial services regulators (including enforcement of state cybersecurity laws). The compliance of our solutions with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors, including the manner in which our clients use them. In some cases, we are directly subject to regulatory oversight and examination. In other cases, our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations and utilize our solutions to achieve compliance with those laws and regulations. In some cases, we may be required to support our clients in achieving compliance with certain laws and regulations by virtue of the services that we provide to them. For example, under the E.U. Digital Operational Resilience Act (\"DORA\"), which came into force in January 2025, our E.U. financial entity clients will require us, as a third-party provider of information and communication technology services, to contract with and manage our relationships with them (and, where applicable, our relationships with critical third-party technology vendors in our supply chain) in accordance with the requirements of DORA. Failure to support our clients in achieving compliance with DORA and similar global regulatory regimes may cause us to lose revenue or clients and/or result in damage to our reputation, and may also attract scrutiny from regulators. In any event, the failure of our solutions to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in suspension or revocation of permission-based regulatory licenses, restrictions on our ability to provide those solutions, the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties, loss of client trust, and/or reputational damage. Further, regulatory authorities have the power to, among other things, enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice, issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced and direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets. We may be adversely affected by increased regulatory scrutiny or related negative publicity.\nThe principal areas of regulation impacting our business are the following:\n•\nOversight by Banking Regulators.\n As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office services to financial institutions, FIS is subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the FFIEC, an interagency body of federal banking regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\"FRB\"), the National Credit Union Administration (\"NCUA\") (collectively, the Federal Banking Agencies or \"FBA\") and the CFPB, including as part of the Multi-Regional Data Processing Servicer (\"MDPS\") program. The MDPS program includes technology suppliers that provide mission-critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC Interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions, and ensure the solutions we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions for which we process. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients. We are also subject to review and examination by state and international regulatory authorities under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing, payments and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information.\n8\nTable of \nContents\nOur U.S.-based wealth and retirement business holds a charter in the state of Georgia, which makes us subject to the regulatory compliance requirements of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance. As a result, we are also authorized to provide trust services in various additional states subject to additional applicable state regulations.\n•\nPayment Services Oversight.\n Our payment services businesses provide technology services to U.S. financial institutions and are, therefore, subject to oversight and examination by the FFIEC. Our payment services businesses are also subject to regulation, supervision, and enforcement authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which include the CFPB and U.S. state regulators. These various regulatory regimes require compliance in respect of many aspects of our payment services businesses including without limitation corporate governance and oversight functions, capital requirements, liquidity, safeguarding, fee regulation adherence, technology and cyber resilience, anti-money laundering and sanctions. \n•\nAnti-Money Laundering.\n The Company is subject to, both directly and indirectly, various anti-money laundering laws and regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act in the United States and the Money Laundering Regulations and Proceeds of Crime Act in the U.K. These laws, among other requirements, impose obligations to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, file regulatory reports on large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and collect and maintain certain records related to customers and transactions. Many U.S. states have similar laws that overlap with, and in some cases diverge from, U.S. federal and international laws. While these federal, state and international laws are broadly consistent, there may be circumstances where the requirements of a particular jurisdiction conflict with those of other jurisdictions. As these laws continue to develop and expand, our investment in compliance with these laws continues to grow, as does the cost of ongoing compliance.\n•\nSanctions.\n The Company is subject to certain U.S. federal, state and international economic and trade sanctions programs, such as those that are administered by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (referred to as \"OFAC\"), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries and regions, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Similar programs exist in a number of other jurisdictions, most notably those administered by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (\"OFSI\") in the U.K., E.U. sanctions, and United Nations sanctions. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with global economic sanctions programs which are increasingly complex and rapidly evolving in response to geopolitical events. Those policies and procedures require the screening of third parties with which the Company does business, including clients and vendors, and transactions where appropriate.\n•\nAnti-Corruption.\n The Company is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give, anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise to gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, training and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.\n•\nPrivacy and Data Protection.\n The Company is subject to an increasing number of privacy and data protection laws, regulations and directives globally, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") in the E.U., the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (\"VCDPA\"), the Colorado Privacy Act (\"CPA\"), the Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act (\"CTDPA\"), the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\"), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") in the United States; the U.K.'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"U.K. GDPR\") and Data Protection Act 2018; the General Personal Data Protection Act (\"LGPD\") in Brazil; the China Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\"); and the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (\"APPI\") (referred to collectively as \"Privacy Laws\"). Many of these Privacy Laws place restrictions on the Company's ability to efficiently transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve.\nOur financial institution clients operating in the U.S. are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the GLBA and numerous similar state laws. GLBA and those state laws place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations under GLBA, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of solutions to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the \n9\nTable of \nContents\nPrivacy Laws and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves. A determination that there have been violations of Privacy Laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation. \nCertain operations of the Company are also subject to the newer, comprehensive, U.S. state-level Privacy Laws that provide consumers with additional data protection rights, including the right to be informed about the personal information collected by third parties and the use of that personal information, and which also impose obligations on companies in connection with the use of personal information.\nThe Company is subject to the E.U.’s GDPR, which applies to all organizations processing the personal data of individuals in the E.U., regardless of where such organization is based. The GDPR has heightened our privacy and data protection compliance obligations, impacted our businesses' collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed stricter standards for reporting data breaches.\n•\nOversight by Securities Regulators. \nOur subsidiary that conducts our broker-dealer business in the U.S. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, is a member of FINRA, and is registered as a broker-dealer in numerous states. Our broker-dealer is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. In addition, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including our broker-dealer. State securities regulators and various exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange, also have regulatory or oversight authority over our broker-dealer. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, public and private securities offerings, use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities, capital structure, record keeping, the financing of customers' purchases and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC's uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer's assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC's uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.\nOur subsidiaries also include an SEC-registered transfer agent. Our registered transfer agent is subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. These laws and regulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Sanctions that may be imposed for non-compliance with these requirements include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines.\nSubsidiaries engaged in activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For example, pursuant to the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\"), certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the FCA. The FSMA and rules promulgated thereunder govern all aspects of the U.K. investment business, including sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, recordkeeping, margin practices and procedures, approval standards for individuals, financial crime systems and controls, periodic reporting and settlement procedures.\n•\nMoney Transfer.\n Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to various federal, state and international laws governing money transmission, including but not limited to the USA PATRIOT Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, as well as various U.S. federal, state and international sanctions requirements. These businesses may also be subject to certain state and local licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In applicable states, we have obtained money transmitter licenses. However, changes to state money transmission laws and regulations, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements, may result in the need for additional or expanded money transmitter licenses, additional capital allocations or changes in the way in which we deliver certain solutions.\n10\nTable of \nContents\n•\nConsumer Reporting and Protection.\n Our decision solutions subsidiary, ChexSystems, maintains a database of consumer information used to provide various account ope\nning services, including credit scoring analysis, and is subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\") and similar state laws. The FCRA regulates consumer reporting agencies (\"CRAs\"), including ChexSystems, and governs the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of CRAs that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating certain information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. CRAs are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of information concerning the individual to whom the report relates and, if a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information in the consumer's file, to conduct a reasonable investigation within statutory timelines. The FCRA imposes many other requirements on CRAs and users of consumer report information. Regulatory enforcement of the FCRA is under the purview of the United States Federal Trade Commission\n, the CFPB, and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another. CRAs are also regulated by a number of states, including New York, with consumer reporting laws that are not pre-empted by the FCRA. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers' personal information, and compliance with these laws, we have made considerable investment to maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate accurate and timely handling of consumer requests for information and disputes. We also are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect consumers' personal information in compliance with these laws.\nOur consumer reporting and consumer-facing businesses are subject to CFPB Bulletin 2013-7 (a successor to the former Regulation AA - Unfair Deceptive Acts or Practices), which defines Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (\"UDAAP\"). This specific bulletin states that UDAAPs can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence, and undermine fair competition in the financial marketplace. Original creditors and other covered persons and service providers under the Dodd-Frank Act involved in collecting debt related to any consumer \nfinancial product\n or service are subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs in the Dodd-Frank Act.\nIn addition, our U.K. regulated entity, Platform Securities LLP, is required to comply with the FCA’s Consumer Duty (the \"Duty\") in connection with its Wealth business. The Duty sets high standards of consumer protection across financial services and requires firms to put their customers' needs first.\n•\nDebt Collection.\n Our collection services are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.\nThe foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our Company is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously. Enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.\nHuman Capital Management\nEmployee Population\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had more than 50,000 employees, including over 32,000 employees principally employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is unionized. Approximately 6,000 of our employees, primarily in Brazil and Europe, are represented by labor unions or works councils as of December 31, 2024.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is a key priority. We have implemented a comprehensive wellness program focused on all aspects of employee wellness – physical, mental, social, and financial. Initiatives under this program are designed to promote healthy lifestyle habits. \nWe continue to operate FIS Cares, a global employee-funded giving program designed to help our employees in times of need. We remain committed to providing a safe working environment that minimizes health risks and prioritizes physical safety.\n11\nTable of \nContents\nCorporate Culture\nOur culture stems from embracing our corporate values as we work together to win as one team, lead with integrity and strive to \"be the change\" for our employees, clients and communities. We believe that inclusion and belonging are at the core of our corporate values. Our focus on continuous learning and a respectful, inclusive environment helps us use our collective strengths to innovate and deliver the best solutions for our clients and partners. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief People Officer regularly update our Board of Directors on human capital management and culture.\nTalent Management\nAlong with our clients and communities, our employees are primary stakeholders in our organization, and so we place a strategic priority on developing our talent and fostering a culture aligned with our corporate values and in which employees receive the support needed to grow and develop their skills and capabilities.\nOur talent development program provides an enterprise-wide, systematic foundation for career development tied to learning paths that enable skills development. Our talent practices are based on a future-focused development approach to equip FIS leaders with the skills required to enable business growth and exceed the needs of our clients. Our employees have a learning roadmap to ‘Build our Leaders of Tomorrow’ which is supported by access to an extensive selection of online self-paced learning resources, virtual instructor-led and face-to-face development offerings, and targeted development programs for high-potential and senior management employees. We engage in executive-level succession planning and provide extensive opportunities to apply for open roles within our organization.

  "item7": "Item 7.\n    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following section discusses management's view of the financial condition and results of operations of FIS and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, unless otherwise noted. \nThis section should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. See \"Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" and \"\nRisk Factors\n\" in Item 1A \n30\nTable of \nContents\nof this Annual Report for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section.\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\nRevenue Sources and Markets\nOur revenue from continuing operations is primarily derived from a combination of technology and processing solutions, transaction processing fees, professional services and software license fees. While we are a global company and do business around the world, the majority of our revenue is generated by clients in the U.S. The majority of our international revenue is generated by clients in the U.K., Germany, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Switzerland and France. In addition, the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring under multi-year Banking and Capital Markets contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream. These solutions, in general, are considered critical to our clients' operations. Professional services revenue is typically non-recurring, though recognition often occurs over time rather than at a point in time. Sales of software licenses are typically non-recurring with point-in-time recognition and are less predictable. \nEconomic Trends\nWe are experiencing relatively stable sales cycles and levels of client activity across our businesses. We have experienced, and continue to experience, relatively high inflation in our primary markets over the medium-term cycle. Relatively high interest rates have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our interest expense. However, during 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the Worldpay Sale to repay our borrowings under our commercial paper programs and reduce our long-term debt, which has decreased our interest expense from previous levels. Impacts of foreign currency fluctuations remained slightly favorable during 2024. Given the volatility of exchange rates and the mix of currencies involved in both revenues and expenses, the direction and magnitude of future effects of currency fluctuations are uncertain. \nWorldpay Sale\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company completed the Worldpay Sale for cash consideration in a transaction valuing the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business at an enterprise value of $18.5 billion, including $1.0 billion of consideration contingent on the returns realized by Buyer exceeding certain thresholds. The net cash proceeds received by FIS at the closing were greater than $12 billion, net of estimated closing adjustments, debt restructuring fees, taxes and transaction costs. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to retire debt and repurchase shares, and we plan to continue to use the remaining proceeds to return additional capital to shareholders through our existing share repurchase authorizations, as well as for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, while maintaining an investment grade credit rating. In connection with the Worldpay Sale, FIS and Worldpay entered into commercial agreements, preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and minimizing potential dis-synergies. FIS and Worldpay also entered into additional agreements as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Upon closing of the Worldpay Sale, we retained a non-controlling 45% equity interest in Worldpay. FIS' share of the net income of Worldpay subsequent to the sale is reported as Equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax. \nAs a result of the Worldpay Sale, we recorded an estimated loss on sale of $578 million during 2024. We\n also recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 billion\n,\n primarily from the release of U.S. deferred tax liabilities that were not transferred in the Worldpay Sale, net of the estimated U.S. tax cost that we expect to incur as a result of the Worldpay Sale. \nCompletion of remaining purchase agreement provisions in connection with the Worldpay Sale could result in further adjustments to the loss on sale amount and the estimated U.S. tax cost.\nInvestments in Innovation\nWe continue to assist financial institutions and other businesses in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements. We believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well-positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve.\nWe continue to invest in modernization, innovation and integrated solutions to meet the demands of the markets we serve and to compete with global banks, financial and other technology providers, and emerging technology innovators. We invest both internally and through investment opportunities in companies building complementary technologies in the financial services space. Our internal development activities have related primarily to the modernization of our proprietary core systems in each of our segments, design and development of next-generation digital and innovative solutions and development of \n31\nTable of \nContents\nprocessing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue to invest an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients, and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure.\nDigital One Platform\nConsumer preference, particularly in younger generations, continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital-first banking solutions. It is increasingly clear that a priority for our clients is to provide a unified, engaging and inclusive banking experience powered by digital capabilities across all channels and customer activities. Our Digital One platform helps our clients, from top-tier large financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets to top-tier and mid-tier community banks, provide a set of modern digital solutions to support all customer types, including retail consumers, sole proprietors, small businesses and large corporations, through any channel, including desktop, tablet, smartphone, and branch. The uniform customer experience extends to support a broad range of financial services including opening new accounts, servicing existing accounts, money movement, and personal financial management, as well as other consumer, small business and commercial banking capabilities. The Digital One platform is host-agnostic, and our digital suite has been enabled across multiple FIS core banking platforms, including IBS, Horizon, Modern Banking Platform, AffinityEdge, and Systematics, in addition to non-FIS platforms run by banking financial institutions who demand market-leading digital capabilities.\nBanking Industry Consolidation\nConsolidation within the banking industry has occurred and may continue to occur, primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions, which generally increases competition among financial technology providers. However, consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business. When consolidations of financial institutions occur, merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit if the client retains our solutions and expands the use of them following the consolidation to support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose revenue if we are providing solutions to both entities, or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our solutions are not chosen to support the newly combined entity. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the solutions that we currently provide or could provide. We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive solutions to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company. \nDemand in Payments Market\nWe continue to see demand in the payments market for innovative solutions that will deliver faster, more convenient payment options in mobile channels, internet applications, in-store cards, and digital currencies. The payment processing industry is adopting new technologies, developing new solutions, evolving new business models, and is being affected by new market entrants and by an evolving regulatory environment. As financial institutions respond to these changes by seeking solutions to help them enhance their own offerings to consumers, including the ability to accept card-not-present payments in eCommerce and mobile environments, as well as contactless cards and mobile wallets at the point of sale, FIS believes that payment processors will seek to develop additional capabilities in order to serve clients' evolving needs. To facilitate this expansion, we believe that payment processors will need to enhance their technology platforms so they can deliver these capabilities and differentiate their offerings from other providers.\nWe believe that these market changes present both an opportunity and a risk for us, and we cannot predict which emerging technologies or solutions will be successful. However, FIS believes that payment processors, like FIS, that have scalable, integrated business models, provide solutions across the payment processing value chain and utilize broad distribution capabilities will be best-positioned to enable emerging alternative electronic payment technologies in the long term. Further, FIS believes that its depth of capabilities and breadth of distribution will enhance its position as emerging payment technologies are adopted by merchants and other businesses. FIS' ability to partner with non-financial institution enterprises, such as mobile payment providers and internet, retail and social media companies, continues to create attractive growth opportunities as these new entrants seek to become more active participants in the development of alternative electronic payment technologies and to facilitate the convergence of retail, online, mobile and social commerce applications.\n32\nTable of \nContents\nCybersecurity Threats and Solutions\nCyberattacks on information technology systems and the vendors and technological supply chain on which they rely continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. This is a trend we expect to continue with widespread impacts, including potentially some pertinent to FIS. The continued growth in the frequency, complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks, coupled with the continued interconnection in the global technology ecosystem, present both a threat and an opportunity for FIS. Using expertise we have gained from our ongoing focus and investment, we have developed and we offer fraud, security, risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry. We also use certain of these solutions to manage our own risks. See Item 1C for additional discussion of how the Company assesses, identifies, and manages cybersecurity risks.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting policies and estimates described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation in the determination of distinct performance obligations. Other judgments may include the evaluation of the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and whether separate contracts with the same customer should be combined and considered part of one arrangement. \nThe determination as to whether individual promised solutions or services can be considered distinct or should instead be combined with other promised solutions or services in a contract may require judgment. We assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - i.e., if a solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. \nDue to the large number, broad nature and average size of our individual customer contracts, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. However, the accounting policies that we apply across similar contracts, products or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position.\nPurchase Accounting\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combination transactions at their estimated fair values, except as otherwise required. Any portion of the purchase price in excess of the recorded amount of the net identifiable assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as customer relationships and software intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment. When necessary, we engage third-party valuation specialists to assist us in making these fair value determinations. We generally use discounted cash flow models, which require internally developed assumptions, to determine the acquisition fair value of customer relationship intangible assets and developed technology software assets. Assumptions for customer relationship asset valuations typically include forecasted revenue attributable to existing customer contracts and relationships, estimated annual attrition, forecasted margin, and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates. Assumptions for software asset valuations typically include forecasted revenue attributable to the software assets, obsolescence rates, estimated royalty rates and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates. The forecasted revenue and margins used in the discounted cash flow models are critical estimates in determining the fair value of customer relationships and developed technology software assets as these estimates are influenced by many factors including historical financial information and management’s expectation for future operating results as a combined company. \n33\nTable of \nContents\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of earnings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we had three acquisitions that were accounted for as business combinations, as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. We had no material business combinations, individually or in the aggregate, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. \nGoodwill Impairment\nThe Company assesses goodwill for impairment by reporting unit on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our primary operating segments, with additional reporting units, as applicable, for certain non-strategic businesses within the Corporate and Other segment. Goodwill impairment assessments require a significant amount of management judgment, and a meaningful change in one or more of the underlying forecasts, estimates, or assumptions used in testing goodwill for impairment could result in a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. Based on the results of our assessments, goodwill of the reporting units in our continuing operations was not impaired in any of the periods presented.\nOur annual impairment test may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and events affecting the reporting unit or Company as a whole, including a sustained decrease in stock price. As a result of the qualitative assessment, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount as a result of the qualitative assessment, or we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit, then we must perform a quantitative assessment for that reporting unit.\nWhen a quantitative assessment is triggered or elected, we typically engage third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of the reporting unit based on the weighted average of two valuation techniques: an income approach (also known as the discounted cash flow method) and a market approach. The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. The income approach involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted revenue, growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, and other factors used to calculate estimated future cash flows. In addition, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions are applied. The market approach involves the selection of guideline public companies and earnings multiples considering factors such as markets of operation, solutions offered, and risk profiles. The income approach used to assess goodwill for impairment is a critical estimate because the forecasted revenue growth rate and margin assumptions (including long-term growth assumptions) underlying the estimated future cash flows are subject to management’s judgment based upon the best available market information, internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. The income approach is also particularly sensitive to the risk-adjusted discount rate selected.\nFor our Banking and Capital Markets reporting units, we performed a quantitative annual assessment in 2022 which concluded that the fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying amounts. For 2023 and 2024, we performed a qualitative annual assessment of these reporting units and concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying amounts. Given the substantial excess of fair value over carrying amounts, we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions to be low.\nIncome Taxes\nThere is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. Management judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities. Management assesses our tax positions based on the application of accounting principles to our facts and circumstances and our interpretation of the tax laws, treaties and regulations, which are complex, vary by jurisdiction and may be subject to different interpretation by relevant taxing authorities.\nWe have various tax filing positions, including the allocation of income among various jurisdictions and the applicability of deductions and credits, which affect the timing and amount of our taxable income. We record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We also evaluate and measure uncertain tax \n34\nTable of \nContents\npositions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and record liabilities for such positions that in our judgment may not be sustained, or only partially sustained, upon examination by taxing authorities. Our assessment may change based on various factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law and audit activity.\nAlthough we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge a position taken, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n \nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe are a party to related-party agreements with Worldpay as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the closing of the Worldpay Sale, we entered into several agreements with certain Worldpay entities and entered into additional agreements with Worldpay during 2024, as further described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nRevenue\n$\n10,127 \n$\n9,831 \n$\n9,720 \n$\n296 \n$\n111 \n3 \n%\n1 \n%\nCost of revenue\n(6,323)\n(6,175)\n(6,259)\n(148)\n84 \n2 \n(1)\nGross profit\n3,804 \n3,656 \n3,461 \n148 \n195 \n4 \n6 \nGross profit margin\n38 \n%\n37 \n%\n36 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n(2,185)\n(2,096)\n(2,182)\n(89)\n86 \n4 \n(4)\nAsset impairments\n(52)\n(113)\n(103)\n61 \n(10)\nNM\nNM\nOther operating (income) expense, net - related party\n(142)\n— \n— \n(142)\n— \nNM\nNM\nOperating income\n1,709 \n1,447 \n1,176 \n262 \n271 \n18 \n23 \nOperating margin\n17 \n%\n15 \n%\n12 \n%\nNM = Not meaningful\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased primarily due to new sales to both new and existing customers and increased transaction processing volumes, partially offset by declines associated with our non-strategic businesses. Revenue was not materially impacted by foreign currency movements versus the prior year period. \nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased primarily due to recurring revenue growth in the Banking and Capital Markets segments. Revenue was not materially impacted by foreign currency movements.\nSee \"Segment Results of Operations\" below for more detailed explanation. \nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased primarily due to increased infrastructure and labor expenses, which include costs to support the Worldpay transition services agreement (\"TSA\"). Gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased primarily due to operating leverage, continued cost management and increased higher-margin license revenue, partially offset by dis-synergies associated with the Worldpay Sale.\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased due to lower intangible asset amortization resulting primarily from using accelerated amortization methods which apply a declining rate over time, contributing to higher gross profit and gross profit margin.\n35\nTable of \nContents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased primarily due to higher expenses relating to the separation of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business, offset in part by lower labor costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased primarily due to lower acquisition, integration and other costs partially offset by inflation.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2024, related primarily to an estimated loss recorded on the expected sale of a non-strategic business.\nAsset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2023, related primarily to the termination of certain internally developed software projects. \nAsset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2022, related primarily to real estate, the sale of a non-strategic business and certain software assets.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nThe annual change in operating income and operating margin for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, resulted from the revenue and cost variances noted above.\nOther Operating (Income) Expense, Net - Related Party\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, under the terms of the Worldpay TSA, during 2024, the Company provided technology infrastructure, risk and security, accounting and various other corporate services to Worldpay. The income received for these services is recorded in Other operating (income) expense, net - related party, and the corresponding expenses are recognized in Cost of revenue and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss).\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\nYear ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nOther income (expense):\n(In millions)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n(250)\n$\n(621)\n$\n(281)\n$\n371 \n$\n(340)\n60 \n%\n(121)\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n(162)\n(164)\n3 \n2 \n$\n(167)\n        NM\nNM\nTotal other income (expense), net\n$\n(412)\n$\n(785)\n$\n(278)\n373 \n$\n(507)\n        NM\nNM\nNM = Not meaningful\nThe decrease in interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily due to a reduction in our outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs and senior notes using a portion of the net proceeds from the Worldpay Sale and increased interest income generated on the proceeds of the Worldpay Sale.\nThe increase in interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to higher interest rates on our variable-rate debt, including the impact of our fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps discussed further in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, offset in part by increased interest income.\nOther income (expense), net for the periods presented consists of various income and expense items outside of the Company's operating activities, including foreign currency transaction remeasurement gains and losses; realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity security investments, including impairment losses on these investments; and fair value adjustments on certain non-operating assets and liabilities, including certain derivatives as further described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. \n36\nTable of \nContents\nThe year ended December 31, 2024, included loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $(174) million, as discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe $(167) million net change in Other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2023, related primarily to foreign currency transaction remeasurement losses and the impact of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps accounted for as economic hedges during the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the interest rate swaps.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nYear ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n$\n362 \n$\n157 \n$\n314 \n$\n205 \n$\n(157)\nNM\nNM\nEffective tax rate\n28 \n%\n24 \n%\n35 \n%\nNM = Not meaningful\nThe increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, was predominately driven by increases to income tax relating to foreign earnings and operations. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reflects its investor-level tax impact relating to equity method investments as a component of Equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss). Therefore, equity method investment earnings (loss) and the related investor-level tax are excluded from the calculation of FIS' annual effective tax rate.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, was predominately driven by the decrease in GAAP pre-tax earnings.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings (Loss)\nYear ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nEquity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax\n$\n(145)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(145)\n$\n— \nNM\nNM\nNM = Not meaningful\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the Worldpay Sale on January 31, 2024, retaining a non-controlling equity interest in Worldpay. We account for our 45% equity interest in Worldpay using the equity method of accounting. During the period from February 1, through December 31, 2024, our share of the net income of Worldpay is reported as Equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax, in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss) and reflects FIS' investor-level tax impact on its investment in Worldpay.

The results of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business prior to the completion of the Worldpay Sale have been presented as discontinued operations. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, changes in each of the captions above from the prior year are a result of the Worldpay Sale.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue from discontinued operations increased from the prior year primarily due to eCommerce volume growth. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations related to major classes of pre-tax earnings (loss), as well as Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, included a $6.8 billion impairment of goodwill. Additionally, beginning on July 5, 2023, the Company ceased amortization of long-lived assets held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2022, earnings (loss) from discontinued operations related to major classes of pre-tax earnings (loss) included a $17.6 billion impairment of goodwill.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax loss on assets held for sale of $1.9 billion, reflecting the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce the Worldpay Merchant Solutions disposal group's carrying value down to fair value less cost to sell as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss on sale of the Worldpay disposal group of $578 million, including the impact of post-closing adjustments recorded to date.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\n, the Company recorded a tax benefit of \n$1.1 billion\n, primarily from the write-off of U.S. deferred tax liabilities that were not transferred in the Worldpay Sale, net of the estimated U.S. tax cost that the Company expects to incur as a result of the Worldpay Sale. \nSegment Results of Operations\nFIS reports its financial performance based on the following segments: Banking Solutions; Capital Market Solutions; \nand Corporate and Other.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure of segment profit or loss reported to the chief operating decision maker, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with FASB ASC Topic 280, \nSegment Reporting\n. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) before net interest expense, net other income (expense), income tax provision (benefit), equity method investment earnings (loss), and depreciation and amortization, and excludes certain costs that do not constitute normal, recurring, cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business. These excluded costs generally consist of the purchase price amortization of acquired intangible assets as well as acquisition, integration and certain other costs and asset impairments. These costs and adjustments are recorded in the \n38\nTable of \nContents\nCorporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below. Financial information, including details of Adjusted EBITDA, for each of our segments is set forth in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.\nBanking Solutions\nYears ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n2024 vs\n2023 vs\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nRevenue\n$\n6,892 \n$\n6,743 \n$\n6,625 \n$\n149 \n$\n118 \n2 \n%\n2 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n3,032 \n$\n2,908 \n$\n2,840 \n124 \n68 \n4 \n2 \nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n44.0 \n%\n43.1 \n%\n42.9 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin basis points change\n90 \n20 \nYear ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2023:\nRevenue in our Banking segment increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2024. Recurring revenue contributed 3% to the total segment revenue growth rate, driven by higher transaction processing revenue. A decline in non-recurring revenue offset the growth rate by (1%), driven by the completion of federally funded pandemic relief programs.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased year over year due to the revenue impacts noted above and the positive impact of the operating leverage and labor productivity and outsourcing initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded year over year, driven primarily by labor productivity and outsourcing initiatives and favorable revenue mix compared to the prior year, including an increase in high-margin license revenue.\nYear ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022:\nRevenue in our Banking segment increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recurring revenue contributed 3% to the total segment revenue growth rate, as payments volumes increased year over year, including volumes in our commercial services and value-added processing businesses. A decline in non-recurring and professional services revenue offset the growth rate by a combined (1%).\nAdjusted EBITDA increased year over year due to the revenue impacts noted above and savings generated from the Company's Future Forward initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat year over year, as Future Forward cost savings offset unfavorable revenue mix year over year, including a reduction in high-margin license and termination fee revenue.\nCapital Market Solutions\nYears ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024s\n2023 vs\n2024vs\n2023 vs\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nRevenue\n$\n2,979 \n$\n2,766 \n$\n2,631 \n$\n213 \n$\n135 \n8 \n%\n5 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,519 \n$\n1,390 \n$\n1,338 \n129 \n52 \n9 \n4 \nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n51.0 \n%\n50.3 \n%\n50.9 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin basis points change\n70 \n(60)\nYear ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2023:\nRevenue in our Capital Markets segment increased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings, including the capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, the U.S. commercial paper program and the Euro-commercial paper program discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The net proceeds from the Worldpay Sale also provided a significant source of funds during 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $4,547 million of available liquidity, including $834 million of cash and cash equivalents and $3,713 million of capacity available under its Revolving Credit Facility. Approximately $370 million of cash and cash equivalents is held by our foreign entities. A portion of our domestic cash and cash equivalents relates to net deposits-in-transit, which are typically settled within a few business days. Debt outstanding totaled $11.3 billion, with an effective weighted average interest rate of 2.8%.\n40\nTable of \nContents\nAlthough we continue to evaluate the optimal capital structure for our business following the completion of the Worldpay Sale, we intend to maintain investment grade debt ratings for FIS.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and debt service payments for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\nIn January 2025, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share beginning with the first quarter of 2025. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share is payable on March 25, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 11, 2025. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends at a target payout ratio consistent with our capital allocation strategy, without regard to our equity method investment earnings (loss) attributable to our interest retained in Worldpay post-separation. However, the amount, declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment opportunities (including potential mergers and acquisitions), results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors, including legal and contractual restrictions, that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements.\nIn January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which it authorized the Company to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock. In August 2024, our Board of Directors approved a separate, incremental share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion in aggregate value of shares of our common stock. Repurchases under these programs will be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Neither of these repurchase programs has an expiration date and either program may be suspended for periods, amended or discontinued at any time. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company repurchased approximately 54 million shares for an aggregate of $4.0 billion in 2024, 9 million shares for an aggregate of $0.5 billion in 2023 and 21 million shares for an aggregate of $1.8 billion in 2022. Approximately 1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the January 2021 program as of December 31, 2024, and the Company will exhaust its authorization under this program in the first quarter of 2025, after which it will repurchase shares under the 2024 authorization. We intend to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion of our shares during the year ending December 31, 2025.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings, adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and other non-cash items including asset impairments, loss on extinguishment of debt, and loss from equity method investment. Cash flows from operations were $2,175 million, $2,078 million and $1,622 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash flows from operations increased $97 million in 2024 and increased $456 million in 2023. The 2024 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by timing of working capital. The 2023 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to timing of working capital, partially offset by lower net earnings adjusted for non-cash items.\nCash Flows from Investing\nOur principal investing activity relates to capital expenditures for software (purchased and internally developed) and property and equipment. We invested approximately $817 million, $780 million and $996 million in capital expenditures (excluding purchases of certain hardware and software subject to financing or other long-term payment arrangements) during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect to continue investing in software and in property and equipment to support our business. \nWe also invest in acquisitions that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities and provide additional solutions to our portfolio, and we dispose of assets that are no longer considered strategic. In 2024, we used approximately $514 million of cash (net of cash acquired) related to new acquisitions. In 2024, in connection with the Worldpay Sale, we received $12.8 billion in cash proceeds and divested $3.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in current assets held for sale at the date of sale. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we paid $202 million related to new acquisitions. We expect to continue to invest in acquisitions as part of our strategy to add solutions to help win new clients and cross-sell to existing clients.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we received distributions of $47 million from Worldpay recorded as investing cash flows. We expect to continue to receive regular cash distributions from Worldpay pursuant to the terms of the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (\"LLCA\") described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n41\nTable of \nContents\nCash flows from investing also occasionally include cash received or paid relative to other activities that are not regularly recurring in nature. In 2024 and 2023, we paid approximately $8 million and $20 million, respectively, and in 2022, we received approximately $726 million, of net cash related to the settlement of cross-currency interest rate swaps.\nCash Flows from Financing\nCash flows from financing principally involve borrowing funds, repaying debt, repurchasing shares and paying dividends, For information regarding the Company's debt and financing activity, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\" in Item 1A and \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk\" in Item 7A of this Annual Report and Notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements. \nIn 2023, we paid $173 million related to the 2020 Virtus acquisition to redeem a put option exercised by the founders as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. \nContractual Obligations\nFIS' long-term contractual obligations generally include its long-term debt, interest on long-term debt including the impact of accounting hedges, net coupon payments on undesignated interest rate swaps, lease payments on certain of its property and equipment and payments for certain purchase commitments and other obligations. See Notes 14, 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information on our long-term debt, financial instruments and operating leases, respectively.
