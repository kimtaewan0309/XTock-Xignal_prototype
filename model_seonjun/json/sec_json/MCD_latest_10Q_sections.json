Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBasis of Presentation\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain columns and rows in financial tables within MD&A may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts for all periods presented.\nOverview\nThe Company franchises and owns and operates McDonald's restaurants, which serve a locally relevant menu of quality food and beverages in communities across more than 100 countries. Of the 44,599 McDonald's restaurants at September 30, 2025, approximately 95% were franchised.\nThe Company's reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\") and International Operated Markets. In addition, there is the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate, which includes the results of over 75 countries, as well as Corporate activities.\nMcDonald's franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. The business relationship between the Company and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies, including McDonald's Global Brand Standards, and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the McDonald’s brand.\nThe Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources.\nDirectly operating McDonald's restaurants contributes significantly to the Company's ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from Company-owned and operated restaurants allows McDonald's to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, the Company is able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies.\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology and digital platforms, and revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand.\nConventional Franchise\nUnder a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and décor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.\nFranchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance and increase the value of the McDonald's brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.\nThe Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all McDonald’s restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company's revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams. \n 17\nTable of Contents\nDevelopmental License or Affiliate\nUnder a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, providing capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any restaurant capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. \nWhile developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets (primarily China and Japan) within the International Developmental Licensed Markets, as well as a limited number of individual restaurants within the International Operated Markets where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.\nStrategic Direction \nThe Company’s \nAccelerating the Arches\n growth strategy (the “Strategy”) encompasses all aspects of McDonald's business as the leading global omni-channel restaurant brand. Our Strategy reflects the Company's purpose, mission and values, as well as growth pillars that build on the Company's competitive advantages. \nPurpose, Mission and Values\nThe following purpose, mission and values underpin the Company's success and are at the heart of our Strategy. \nThrough its size and scale, the Company embraces and prioritizes its role and commitment to the communities in which it operates through its purpose to feed and foster communities, and its mission to make delicious feel-good moments easy for everyone. The Company is guided by five core values that define who it is and how it runs the business across the three-legged stool of McDonald's franchisees, suppliers and employees:\n1.\nServe - \nWe put our customers and people first;\n \n2.\nInclusion -\n We open our doors to everyone;\n3.\nIntegrity -\n We do the right thing; \n \n4.\nCommunity -\n We are good neighbors; and \n5.\nFamily -\n We get better together.\nThe Company believes that its people, all around the world, set it apart and bring these values to life daily. \nGrowth Pillars\nThe following growth pillars, M-C-D, build on historic strengths and articulate areas of further opportunity. Under our Strategy, the Company will:\n•\nM\naximize our Marketing \nby investing in new, culturally relevant approaches, grounded in fan truths, to effectively communicate the story of our brand, food and purpose. The Company continues to build relevance with customers through emotional connections and world class creative, which are central to the brand’s “Feel-Good Marketing” approach. This is exemplified by campaigns that elevate the entire brand and continue to be scaled around the globe to connect with customers in authentic and relatable ways. The Company is committed to a marketing strategy that highlights value at every tier of the menu, as providing delicious and affordable menu options remains a cornerstone of the McDonald's brand. This includes everyday low-price options on our menu, affordable meal bundles, limited-time deals and personalized value and digital offers available in our mobile app.\n•\nC\nommit to the Core \nmenu by tapping into customer demand for the familiar and focusing on serving our iconic products that are beloved by customers around the world such as our World Famous Fries, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder and Chicken McNuggets, which are some of our seventeen unique billion-dollar brands. Building on its foundational strength with burgers, the Company will continue to evolve and innovate its longest-standing menu item with plans to continue to implement “Best Burger”; a series of operational and formulation changes designed to deliver hotter, juicier, tastier burgers to nearly all markets by the end of 2026. Further, the Company is focused on continuing to gain share in the rapidly growing chicken category, as we continue to aggressively grow our chicken brands. This includes plans to offer the McCrispy sandwich in nearly all major markets by the end of 2025 and to extend the McCrispy brand into strips and wraps in several markets. These planned innovations and new menu offerings reflect the Company's ability to meet evolving customer preferences. The Company also continues to see a significant opportunity with beverages to drive long-term growth.\n•\nD\nouble Down on the 4D's: Digital, Delivery, Drive Thru and Restaurant Development \nby continuing to leverage competitive strengths and building a powerful digital experience growth engine to deliver a personalized and convenient customer experience. As another way to unlock further growth, the Company plans to continue to accelerate the pace of restaurant openings and technology innovation so that whenever and however customers choose to interact with McDonald's, they can enjoy a fast, easy experience that meets their needs.\n 18\nTable of Contents\n◦\nDigital:\n The Company's digital experience is transforming how customers order, pay and receive their food. Through digital tools, customers can access personalized offers, participate in a loyalty program, order through our mobile app and receive McDonald's food through the channel of their choice. We are also providing increased convenience to customers through “Ready on Arrival”; a digital enhancement that enables crew to begin assembling a customer's mobile order prior to arrival at the restaurant to expedite service and elevate customer satisfaction. The Company plans to deploy this initiative in its top six markets by the end of 2025. The Company has successful loyalty programs in 60 markets, including its top six markets. McDonald's loyalty customers have proven to be highly engaged, and the Company plans to increase its 90-day active users to 250 million by the end of 2027. Further, the Company plans to grow its annual Systemwide sales to loyalty members to $45.0 billion by the end of 2027.\n◦\nDelivery:\n The Company offers delivery from approximately 40,000 restaurants across approximately 100 markets, representing nearly 90% of McDonald's restaurants. The Company is continuing to build on and enhance the delivery experience for customers, including adding the ability to place a delivery order in our mobile app (a feature that is currently available in five of the Company's top markets). The Company continues to scale this capability and expects to increase the percentage of Systemwide delivery sales originating from our mobile app to 30% by the end of 2027. The Company also has long-term strategic partnerships with delivery providers that continue to benefit the Company, customers and franchisees by optimizing operational efficiencies and creating a seamless customer experience.\n◦\nDrive Thru:\n The Company has the most drive thru locations worldwide, with nearly 29,000 drive thru locations globally, including over 95% of the over 13,500 locations in the U.S. This channel remains a competitive advantage in meeting customers’ demand for flexibility and choice. McDonald's network currently provides unmatched scale and convenience for customers, while also offering significant growth opportunities, such as adding additional drive thru lanes to increase capacity and improve speed and efficiency. The Company continues to build on its drive thru advantage, as the vast majority of new restaurant openings in the U.S. and International Operated Markets will include a drive thru.\n◦\nRestaurant Development:\n The Company will continue to accelerate the pace of restaurant openings to attempt to fully capture the demand being driven through our Strategy in many of our largest markets. In 2025, the Company plans to open about 2,200 new restaurants (gross) across the globe, which will contribute to slightly over 4% new unit growth (net of closures). Further, the Company continues to build on its industry-leading development, by progressing toward the targeted expansion to 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027, which would make it the fastest period of restaurant unit growth in Company history.\nFoundation and Platforms\nFoundational to our Strategy is keeping the customer and restaurant crew at the center of everything the Company does, along with focusing relentlessly on running great restaurants, empowering our people and continuing to modernize our ways of working. Further, as part of the Company's plans for long term growth and solidifying McDonald's leadership position, the Company will continue to develop and implement three technology-enabled platforms designed to build our competitive advantages, cement our place in culture and stay one step ahead of our customers' expectations. Together, our foundation and platforms will extend the Company's leadership position and unlock new growth opportunities and efficiencies for our business over the long-term.\nOur platforms are:\n•\nConsumer:\n The Company is \nbuilding\n \none of the world’s largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement\n, which will bring together the best of our brand and utilize our physical and digital competitive advantages. The consumer platform will enable the Company to accelerate growth in our loyalty program and drive valuable loyalty customers to visit more frequently.\n•\nRestaurant:\n The Company is \nbuilding the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform\n which enables the Company and franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently and utilize the latest cloud-based technology to make it easier for restaurant crew to deliver exceptional customer service. The Company intends to deploy new, universal software that all McDonald's restaurants will run on, enabling restaurants to roll out innovation even faster, with less complexity and more reliability; and customers will enjoy a more familiar, consistent experience.\n•\nCompany: \nThe Company is \nbuilding a modern company platform, through our GBS organization, that unlocks speed and innovation\n throughout the organization, to enable further growth as it modernizes the way it works by focusing on becoming faster, more innovative and more efficient at solving problems for its customers and people.\nOur Strategy is aligned with the Company's capital allocation philosophy of (i) invest in opportunities to grow the business and drive strong returns, including both capital expenditures as well as investments in technology, digital, and our GBS organization, (ii) prioritize our dividend and (iii) repurchase shares with remaining free cash flow over time.\nThe Company believes our Strategy builds on our inherent strengths by harnessing the Company's competitive advantages while leveraging its size, scale, agility and the power of the McDonald's brand to adapt and adjust to meet customer demands in varying economic environments, including the current industry-wide challenges associated with more discerning consumer spending. Our Strategy \n 19\nTable of Contents\nis supported by a strong global senior leadership team aimed at executing against the MCD growth pillars, further developing our three platforms and driving long-term growth through increasing guest counts and growing industry market share.\nThird Quarter and Nine Months 2025 Financial Performance \nGlobal comparable sales increased 3.6% for the quarter and 2.2% for the nine months.\n•\nU.S. comparable sales increased 2.4% for the quarter and 0.5% for the nine months. Comparable sales results for both periods were primarily driven by positive check growth. \n•\nInternational Operated Markets comparable sales increased 4.3% for the quarter and 2.6% for the nine months. All markets reflected positive comparable sales for the quarter, led by Germany and Australia. Results for the nine months were driven by positive comparable sales in nearly all markets.\n•\nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets comparable sales increased 4.7% for the quarter and 4.6% for the nine months. Positive comparable sales for both periods were led by Japan, with all geographic regions reflecting positive comparable sales.\nIn addition to the comparable sales results, the Company had the following financial results for the quarter and nine months:\n•\nConsolidated revenues increased 3% (1% in constant currencies) for the quarter and 2% (1% in constant currencies) for the nine months.\n•\nSystemwide sales increased 8% (6% in constant currencies) for the quarter and 5% (5% in constant currencies) for the nine months.\n•\nConsolidated operating income increased 5% (3% in constant currencies) for the quarter and 4% (3% in constant currencies) for the nine months. Excluding current and prior year charges detailed in the Operating Income and Operating Margin section on page \n30\n of this report, consolidated operating income increased 3% (1% in constant currencies) for the quarter and 3% (2% in constant currencies) for the nine months.\n•\nDiluted earnings per share was $\n3.18\n for the quarter, an increase of 2% (flat in constant currencies) and $\n8.92\n for the nine months, an increase of 4% (3% in constant currencies). Excluding current and prior year charges detailed in the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page \n24\n of this report, diluted earnings per share for the quarter was flat at $3.22 (a decrease of 1% in constant currencies) and $9.08, an increase of 2% (1% in constant currencies) for the nine months.\nManagement reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n 20\nTable of Contents\nThe Following Definitions Apply to these Terms as Used Throughout this Report:\n•\nConstant currency\n results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n•\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts\n are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. \n•\nSystemwide sales\n include sales at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are comprised of all sales to customers who self-identify as a loyalty member when transacting with both Company-owned and operated and franchised restaurants. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are measured across 60 markets with loyalty programs. Systemwide sales to loyalty members represents an aggregation of the prior four quarters of sales to loyalty members active in the last 90 days of the respective quarter.\n \nWhile franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. \n•\nFree cash flow\n, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. \n 21\nTable of Contents\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nDollars in millions, except per share data\nQuarters Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nInc/(Dec)\nRevenues\nRevenues from franchised restaurants\n$\n4,363\n \n$\n4,094\n \n7 \n%\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants\n2,563\n \n2,656\n \n(3)\nOther revenues\n151\n \n124\n \n22 \nTotal revenues\n7,078\n \n6,873\n \n3 \nOperating costs and expenses\nFranchised restaurants-occupancy expenses\n666\n \n646\n \n3 \nCompany-owned and operated restaurant expenses\n2,172\n \n2,248\n \n(3)\nOther restaurant expenses\n135\n \n104\n \n30 \nSelling, general & administrative expenses\nDepreciation and amortization\n121\n \n111\n \n8 \nOther\n664\n \n536\n \n24 \nOther operating (income) expense, net\n(\n37\n)\n39\n \nn/m\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n3,721\n \n3,685\n \n1 \nOperating income\n3,357\n \n3,188\n \n5 \nInterest expense\n406\n \n381\n \n7 \nNonoperating (income) expense, net\n1\n \n(\n36\n)\nn/m\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n2,949\n \n2,843\n \n4 \nProvision for income taxes\n671\n \n588\n \n14 \nNet income\n$\n2,278\n \n$\n2,255\n \n1 \n%\nEarnings per common share-basic\n$\n3.20\n \n$\n3.15\n \n2 \n%\nEarnings per common share-diluted\n$\n3.18\n \n$\n3.13\n \n2 \n%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nInc/(Dec)\nRevenues\nRevenues from franchised restaurants\n$\n12,238\n \n$\n11,756\n \n4 \n%\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants\n7,154\n \n7,472\n \n(4)\nOther revenues\n485\n \n304\n \n60 \nTotal revenues\n19,876\n \n19,532\n \n2 \nOperating costs and expenses\nFranchised restaurants-occupancy expenses\n1,940\n \n1,902\n \n2 \nCompany-owned and operated restaurant expenses\n6,109\n \n6,358\n \n(4)\nOther restaurant expenses\n424\n \n241\n \n76 \nSelling, general & administrative expenses\nDepreciation and amortization\n333\n \n311\n \n7 \nOther\n1,834\n \n1,748\n \n5 \nOther operating (income) expense, net\n(\n1\n)\n129\n \nn/m\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n10,639\n \n10,688\n \n— \nOperating income\n9,237\n \n8,844\n \n4 \nInterest expense\n1,172\n \n1,126\n \n4 \nNonoperating (income) expense, net\n(\n75\n)\n(\n90\n)\n(16)\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n8,140\n \n7,807\n \n4 \nProvision for income taxes\n1,740\n \n1,600\n \n9 \nNet income\n$\n6,399\n \n$\n6,207\n \n3 \n%\nEarnings per common share-basic\n$\n8.96\n \n$\n8.63\n \n4 \n%\nEarnings per common share-diluted\n$\n8.92\n \n$\n8.59\n \n4 \n%\nn/m Not meaningful\n 22\nTable of Contents\nImpact of the War in the Middle East\nThe Company’s Systemwide sales and revenue have continued to be negatively impacted by the war in the Middle East, primarily in the International Developmental Licensed Markets, where the majority of restaurants are under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement. The Company is monitoring the evolving situation, which it expects to continue to have a negative impact on Systemwide sales and revenue until macroeconomic conditions recover. The Company generally does not invest any restaurant capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Translation\nThe impact of foreign currency translation on consolidated operating results for both periods primarily reflected the strengthening of most major currencies against the U.S. Dollar, partly offset by the weakening of the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.\nWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald's mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. \nIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n \n \n \nDollars in millions, except per share data\n \n \n \nCurrency \nTranslation \nBenefit/ (Cost)\nQuarters Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\nRevenues\n$\n7,078\n \n$\n6,873\n \n$\n151\n \nFranchised margins\n3,697\n \n3,447 \n74\n \nCompany-owned and operated margins\n391\n \n407 \n10\n \nSelling, general & administrative expenses\n785\n \n647 \n(6)\nOperating income\n3,357\n \n3,188\n \n78\n \nNet income\n2,278\n \n2,255\n \n31\n \nEarnings per share-diluted\n$\n3.18\n \n$\n3.13\n \n$\n0.04\n \nCurrency \nTranslation \nBenefit/ (Cost)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\nRevenues\n$\n19,876\n \n$\n19,532\n \n$\n161\n \nFranchised margins\n10,298\n \n9,855 \n81\n \nCompany-owned and operated margins\n1,044\n \n1,114 \n10\n \nSelling, general & administrative expenses\n2,167\n \n2,059 \n(7)\nOperating income\n9,237\n \n8,844\n \n87\n \nNet income\n6,399\n \n6,207\n \n44\n \nEarnings per share-diluted\n$\n8.92\n \n$\n8.59\n \n$\n0.06\n \n 23\nTable of Contents\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings per Share \nFor the quarter, net income increased 1% (flat in constant currencies) to $\n2,278\n million, and diluted earnings per share increased 2% (flat in constant currencies) to $\n3.18\n.

Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company’s Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology and digital platforms and revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald’s brand.\nFranchised restaurants represented approximately\n \n95% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at \nSeptember 30, 2025\n. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams. \n 24\nTable of Contents\nREVENUES\n \n \n \n \nDollars in millions\n \n \n \n \nQuarters Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nInc/ (Dec)\nInc/ (Dec) \nExcluding \nCurrency \nTranslation\nFranchised revenues\n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n1,906\n \n$\n1,851 \n3 \n%\n3 \n%\nInternational Operated Markets\n1,962\n \n1,781 \n10 \n6 \nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate\n496\n \n461 \n8 \n6 \nTotal\n$\n4,363\n \n$\n4,094 \n7 \n%\n4 \n%\nCompany-owned and operated sales\n \n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n790\n \n$\n822 \n(4)\n%\n(4)\n%\nInternational Operated Markets\n1,645\n \n1,485 \n11 \n7 \nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate\n128\n \n349 \n(63)\nn/m\nTotal\n$\n2,563\n \n$\n2,656 \n(3)\n%\n(6)\n%\nTotal Franchised revenues and Company-owned and operated sales\n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n2,696\n \n$\n2,673 \n1 \n%\n1 \n%\nInternational Operated Markets\n3,606\n \n3,266 \n10 \n6 \nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate\n625\n \n810 \n(23)\n(25)\nTotal\n$\n6,927\n \n$\n6,750 \n3 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal Other revenues\n$\n151\n \n$\n124\n \n22 \n%\n22 \n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n7,078\n \n$\n6,873\n \n3 \n%\n1 \n%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nInc/ (Dec)\nInc/ (Dec) \nExcluding \nCurrency \nTranslation\nFranchised revenues\n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n5,485\n \n$\n5,417 \n1 \n%\n1 \n%\nInternational Operated Markets\n5,354\n \n5,039 \n6 \n4 \nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate\n1,398\n \n1,300 \n8 \n8 \nTotal\n$\n12,238\n \n$\n11,756 \n4 \n%\n3 \n%\nCompany-owned and operated sales\n \n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n2,306\n \n$\n2,417 \n(5)\n%\n(5)\n%\nInternational Operated Markets\n4,518\n \n4,278 \n6 \n5 \nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate\n330\n \n777 \n(57)\nn/m\nTotal\n$\n7,154\n \n$\n7,472 \n(4)\n%\n(5)\n%\nTotal Franchised revenues and Company-owned and operated sales\n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n7,791\n \n$\n7,834 \n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\nInternational Operated Markets\n9,872\n \n9,317 \n6 \n4 \nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate\n1,728\n \n2,077 \n(17)\n(17)\nTotal\n$\n19,391\n \n$\n19,228 \n1 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal Other revenues\n$\n485\n \n$\n304\n \n60 \n%\n60 \n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n19,876\n \n$\n19,532\n \n2 \n%\n1 \n%\nn/m Not meaningful\n•\nTotal Franchised revenues and Company-owned and operated sales increased 3% (flat in constant currencies)  for the quarter and increased 1% (flat in constant currencies) for the nine months.

The decrease was primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an increased ownership stake in McDonald's China business in the prior year.\nCash used for financing activities totaled $3.9 billion for the nine months 2025, a decrease of $1.7 billion compared with the nine months 2024. The decrease was primarily due to higher bond issuances and lower treasury stock purchases in the current year.\n 31\nTable of Contents\nOutlook \nBased on current conditions, the following is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results for 2025.\n•\nThe Company expects net restaurant unit expansion will contribute slightly over 2% to 2025 Systemwide sales growth, in constant currencies.\n•\nThe Company expects full year 2025 Selling, general and administrative expenses of about 2.2% of Systemwide sales.\n•\nThe Company expects 2025 operating margin percent to be in the mid-to-high 40% range.\n•\nBased on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2025 to increase about 4% driven primarily by higher average debt balances and higher average interest rates.\n•\nThe Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2025 to be between 21% and 22%. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. \n•\nThe Company expects 2025 capital expenditures to be between $3.0 and $3.2 billion, with the majority directed towards new restaurant unit expansion across the U.S. and International Operated Markets. Globally, the Company expects to open approximately 2,200 restaurants. The Company expects to open about 600 restaurants in the U.S. and International Operated Markets, and that developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards about 1,600 restaurant openings in their respective markets. The Company expects nearly 1,800 net restaurant additions in 2025.\n•\nThe Company expects to achieve a free cash flow conversion rate in the low-to-mid 80% range.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements are discussed in the \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" section in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n 32\nTable of Contents\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this report contains forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as “could,” “should,” “can,” “continue,” “aim,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “intend,” “look,” “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “remain,” “confident,” “commit,” “enable,” “potential” and “trajectory” or similar expressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. You should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factors\n \nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\nSTRATEGY AND BRAND\nIf we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies – including the components of our \nAccelerating the Arches\n growth strategy – must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System’s continued ability to:\n•\ncapitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n•\ninnovate and differentiate the McDonald’s experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n•\nbuild upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world’s largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n•\nrun great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently and utilize the latest cloud-based technology to make it easier for crews to deliver exceptional customer service;\n•\naccelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n•\nevolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nFailure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at McDonald’s restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the “informal eating out” (“IEO”) segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n 33\nTable of Contents\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\nOur continued success depends on our System’s ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are able to do so more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy. However, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, which could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.\nAdditionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching consumers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital, allows us to reach consumers effectively, efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.\nOur investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in restaurant development, technology, digital engagement and delivery in order to transform and enhance the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which efforts may not generate expected results. We also continue to expand and refine our delivery initiatives, including through integrating delivery and mobile ordering. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction and may introduce additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not successfully executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\nWe face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.\nWe compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, coffee shops and online retailers. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions, product offerings, technologies or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have short- and long-term impacts on our results.\nWe compete primarily on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in restaurant development, technology, digital engagement and delivery, and respond effectively to our competitors’ actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting others, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald’s brand and our business.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been, and may never be, registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, particularly in rapidly evolving areas, and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether \n 34\nTable of Contents\nor not it has merit, could, particularly in rapidly evolving areas, be time consuming, or result in costly litigation and could also have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property.\nOPERATIONS\nThe global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nWe encounter differing and evolving cultural, regulatory, geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald’s restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System’s success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald’s customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and negatively impact our business results.\nDisruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions (whether proposed or realized, unilateral or bilateral), such as price, foreign exchange or trade-related tariffs or controls, trade policies and regulations, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees’ or our suppliers’ operations, and asset seizures. Some or all of the above-referenced disruptions or volatility can also result from acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Such governmental actions may have a broader impact on macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical tensions, anti-American sentiment, consumer demand and the ability of us and our franchisees to operate in certain geographic areas, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. \nWhile we may face challenges and uncertainties in any of the markets in which we operate, such challenges and uncertainties are often heightened in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nSupply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure a reliable and sufficient supply of quality products, equipment and other materials on favorable terms. Although many of these items are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain items have limited suppliers, which increases our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, inflationary pressures, tariffs, unexpected increases in demand, transportation-related issues, labor-related issues, technology-related issues, weather-related events, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control or that of our suppliers or franchisees. Interruptions in our System’s supply chain or ineffective contingency planning can increase our costs, impact ingredient quality, delay new restaurant openings, and/or limit the quality or availability of products, equipment and other materials that are critical to our System’s operations or to restaurant development.\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks.\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-owned and operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If franchisee sales trends worsen, or any of such risks materialize or intensify, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks’ lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n 35\nTable of Contents\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.\nContinued challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our System’s ability to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in McDonald’s restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. We and our franchisees have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in adequately staffing certain McDonald’s restaurants, which can negatively impact operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System’s ability to meet its labor needs as they evolve is generally subject to a variety of factors, including the availability of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\nFurther, our System has experienced increased costs and competition associated with attracting, recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at McDonald’s restaurants.  We and our franchisees also continue to be impacted by increasingly complex U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting our respective workforces.  These laws and regulations are increasingly focused on, and in certain cases impose requirements with respect to, employment matters such as wages and hours, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Such laws and regulations can expose us and our franchisees to increased costs and other effects of compliance, including potential liability, and all such labor and compliance costs could have a negative impact on our Company-owned and operated margins and franchisee profitability.\nOur potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.\nEffective succession planning is important to our continued success.\nEffective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified key personnel, or to execute smooth personnel transitions, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.\nFood safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety concerns have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System’s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald’s of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources aimed at ensuring that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred within the food industry and our System from time to time and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial results.\nIf we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nWe have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-owned and operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.\nOur real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels, the cost of financing, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results.\n 36\nTable of Contents\nInformation technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.\nWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, that support our business operations, including our digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. Any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees’ operations, or our customers’ experiences and perceptions. In addition, the artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our business may not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results. \nSecurity incidents and breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties with whom we communicate or collaborate (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, deepfakes and other malicious uses of artificial intelligence, introduction of malware or ransomware, other disruptive problems caused by hackers or unintentional events. Certain of these technology systems contain personal, confidential, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees and their employees, suppliers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in place in the event an incident occurs, it could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or a security breach including the theft or unauthorized disclosure of certain of the above-described information. The actual or alleged occurrence of any of these types of incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including administrative fines, criminal or civil penalties or civil liabilities.\nDespite the implementation of business continuity measures, any of these technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and/or maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third-party systems also subjects us to risks faced by those third-party businesses, including operational, security and credit risks. Further, the technology systems of third parties upon which we rely to conduct our business could be compromised in a manner that adversely affects us and our technology systems, information and business continuity. If technology systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not effective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees’ operations. While we maintain insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY\nIncreasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, restaurant operations, product packaging, marketing, use of information technology systems, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. We also are subject to increasing public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance matters. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of regulations and other initiatives that can affect our business plans and operations, which have increased and may continue to increase our costs of doing business and exposure to litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.\nWe are also subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to, class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations and proceedings, shareholder proceedings, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, supplier-related disputes, and claims by current or former franchisees. Regardless of whether claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations.\nLitigation, legislative and regulatory action concerning our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law or other purposes, if determined adversely, could challenge our franchise business model, increase costs, negatively impact our business operations and the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.\nOur results could also be affected by the following:\n•\nthe relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;\n 37\nTable of Contents\n•\nthe cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; and\n•\nadverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices.\nA judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third-party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may hurt our business. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory and legal environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the U.S. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nChanges in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.\nNew accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.\nIn assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, interest rate levels, competition, consumer and demographic trends and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. Any such changes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.\nIf we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we could be subject to legal proceedings and penalties, which could negatively affect our financial results or brand perceptions.\nWe are subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability related to privacy and data protection requirements, including those associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to business partners, customers, employees, franchisees or other third parties. An increasing number of our markets have enacted new privacy and data protection requirements (including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and various U.S. state-level laws), and further requirements are likely to be proposed or enacted in the future. Failure to comply with these privacy and data protection laws could result in legal proceedings and substantial administrative fines, criminal or civil penalties or civil liabilities and materially adversely impact our financial results or brand perceptions.\nMACROECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can be impacted by a variety of factors, including hostilities, epidemics, pandemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity, stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Sustained adverse economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions put pressure on our operating performance and business continuity disruption planning, and our business and financial results may suffer as a result.\nOur results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and unfavorable currency fluctuations could adversely affect reported earnings.\nHealth epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nHealth epidemics or pandemics have in the past and may in the future impact macroeconomic conditions, consumer behavior, labor availability and supply chain management, as well as local operations in impacted markets, all of which can adversely affect our business, financial results and outlook. Governmental responses to health epidemics or pandemics, including operational restrictions and temporary restaurant closures, can also affect the foregoing items and adversely affect our business and financial results. The duration and scope of a health epidemic or pandemic can be difficult to predict and depends on many factors, including the emergence of new variants and the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of preventative measures. A health epidemic or pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed \n 38\nTable of Contents\nin these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to the availability and costs of labor and commodities, supply chain interruptions, consumer behavior, and consumer perceptions of our brand and industry.\nChanges in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe profitability of our Company-owned and operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel and utilities, as well as distribution and other operating costs, including labor. Volatility in certain commodity prices and fluctuations in labor costs have adversely affected and in the future could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand and other macroeconomic conditions, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls, government regulation, and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. Our System can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nA decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, our collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders were to impose new operating or financial covenants.\nOur operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.\nMany factors affect the trading volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. These factors, many of which are beyond our control, include the following:\n•\nthe unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions;\n•\ngovernmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic, trade or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;\n•\ntrading activity in our common stock, in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or in our debt securities, which can be affected by: market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our common stock by significant shareholders; and trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald’s may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average;\n•\nthe impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and\n•\nthe impact of corporate actions, including changes to our corporate structure, and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, including those we may take from time to time as we implement our business strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations.\nOur business is subject to an increasing focus on environmental and social impact matters.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders – including employees, franchisees, customers, suppliers, governmental and non-governmental organizations and investors – on environmental and social impact matters. A failure, whether real or perceived, to address environmental and social impact matters or to achieve progress on our environmental and social impact initiatives on the anticipated timing or at all, could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as those related to consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and regulatory complexity. Conversely, our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on environmental and social impact, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters could also adversely impact our business.\nThe standards we set for ourselves regarding environmental and social impact matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have announced initiatives relating to, among other things, climate action, sustainability, and responsible sourcing. In addition, we are engaging in social impact initiatives, including community engagement and philanthropy; as well as our commitment to inclusion. We have faced increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. We have also experienced increased pressure from stakeholders to provide expanded disclosure and establish additional \n 39\nTable of Contents\ncommitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market, operational, execution and reputational costs and risks. Moreover, addressing environmental and social impact matters requires Systemwide as well as third party coordination and alignment, over which we do not have complete control and which may be unpredictable. The standards by which certain environmental and social impact matters are measured are also evolving and subject to assumptions that could change over time. \nEvents such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social and geopolitical unrest and climate change, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, social and geopolitical unrest, including anti-American sentiment, and climate change (or expectations or uncertainty about them) can adversely affect consumer confidence levels and behavior, supply availability and costs and local operations, including temporary restaurant closures and delayed new restaurant openings, in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of weather-related events and natural disasters. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully."
