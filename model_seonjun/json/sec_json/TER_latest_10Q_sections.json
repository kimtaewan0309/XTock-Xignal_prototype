Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See also Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.\n \nOverview\n \nWe are a leading global provider of automated test equipment and robotics products. Our automated test systems are used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage, silicon photonics, and complex electronics systems in many industries including consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our robotics product offerings consist primarily of collaborative robotic arms and autonomous mobile robots used by global manufacturing, logistics and industrial customers to improve quality and increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency, while reducing costs. In the first quarter of 2025, we identified opportunities for operational synergies amongst our production board test, defense and aerospace, and wireless test businesses leading to the creation of the Product Test division as a new segment effective March 2025. Our automated test equipment and robotics products and services include:\n \n•\nsemiconductor test (“Semiconductor Test”) systems; \n•\nrobotics (“Robotics”) products; and\n•\nproduct test (\"Product Test\") systems, which includes defense/aerospace (\"Defense/Aerospace\") test instrumentation and systems, circuit-board test and inspection (\"Production Board Test\") systems, wireless test systems (\"Wireless Test\"), and photonic integrated circuit (\"PIC\") test solutions.\nThe market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. A few customers drive significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.\nArtificial Intelligence applications and data center power demand drove strong third quarter performance with our customers accelerating development and ramping production for a wide range of devices. We expect this acceleration to continue and even expand into the fourth quarter and into 2026 and are currently investing in sales, engineering, and support to pursue these, and additional, market opportunities in Semiconductor Test. Robotics revenue in the third quarter was flat with second quarter sales due to ongoing business environment challenges. Our focus in the Robotics segment remains on operating expense management and our channel transformation strategy as we transition toward serving large direct customers and building a Robotics organization that can grow profitably over the mid-term.\n \nOn May 31, 2025, we acquired privately held Quantifi Photonics (\"Quantifi\"), a leader in PIC test solutions for a total purchase price of approximately $127.2 million. This acquisition enables the delivery of scalable PIC test solutions and is included in our Product Test segment. Over time, we also intend to leverage the engineering expertise and technology to enhance functionality and create additional differentiation in our Semiconductor Test business, specifically with integration into our UltraFlexPlus platform.\nOn January 31, 2025, we acquired Infineon Technologies AG's (\"Infineon\") automated test equipment technology and associated development team (\"AET\") based in Regensburg, Germany for a total purchase price of 17.6 million Euros, equivalent to $18.3 million. AET adds resources and expertise to our company and strengthens the relationship between Teradyne and this key customer. AET is included in our Semiconductor Test segment.\nWhile revenues in our test businesses are predominantly in U.S. dollars, the majority of our Robotics revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar has, and will continue to, negatively affect Robotics revenue throughout 2025.\n \nOur capital allocation plan will continue to be balanced between investing in organic and inorganic growth and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. During the first nine months of 2025 we completed the acquisitions of Quantifi and AET and additionally, we returned $576.3 million to shareholders through $518.7 million of share buybacks and $57.6 million of dividend payments.\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn July 4, 2025, H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (“OBBBA”), was signed into law, enacting significant changes to U.S. corporate tax law. The OBBBA modified and made permanent several provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including reductions in scheduled increases for the rate of taxation of foreign income, immediate deductibility of U.S. research and development expenses, and reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property. As of September 28, 2025, the condensed consolidated financial statements were not materially impacted by the OBBBA. Teradyne continues to evaluate the provisions of the OBBBA and will incorporate any necessary adjustments as further guidance becomes available.\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the exact impact, current trade restrictions are limiting our ability to be competitive particularly in certain markets, where other companies are not subjected to the same restrictions. Current tariffs have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial results, however, the global trade environment remains dynamic and subject to change. We continue to monitor developments in international trade policy, including potential changes to tariffs, further export controls, and other regulatory measures that could affect our supply chain, cost structure, or market access.\n \nFor information regarding risks associated with import-export control regulations and similar applicable laws and regulations, see Part II - Item 1A \"Risk Factors- Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\" included elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \nWe have identified the policies which are critical to understanding our business and our results of operations. There have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 28, 2025, to the items disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\nCritical accounting estimates are complex and may require significant judgment by management. Changes to the underlying assumptions may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nPreparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates\n \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED\n

The decrease in Robotics revenues of $13.6 million, or 15.3%, was primarily due to lower sales of collaborative robotic arms.\nRevenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows (1):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFor the Three Months\n Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorea\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalaysia\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilippines\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThailand\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRest of World\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nRevenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site. \nGross Profit\n \nOur gross profit was as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFor the Three Months\n Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDollar/Point\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross profit\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n449.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n436.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of total revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n58.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n59.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nGross profit as a percent of revenue decreased by 0.8 points, primarily due to product mix in Semiconductor Test.\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling and Administrative\n \nSelling and administrative expenses were as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFor the Three Months\n Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDollar\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling and administrative\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n169.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n157.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of total revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe increase of $11.5 million in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by strategic investments in Semiconductor Test.\nEngineering and Development\n \nEngineering and development expenses were as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFor the Three Months\n Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDollar\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering and development\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n124.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n117.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of total revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe increase of $7.3 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily driven by strategic investments in Semiconductor Test.\nRestructuring and Other\n \nDuring the three months ended September 28, 2025, we recorded $4.8 million of severance charges, $3.6 million of which is related to headcount reductions in Robotics.

The increase in income before income taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliate in Robotics was primarily due to lower operating expenses primarily as a result of restructuring actions.\nIncome Taxes\n \nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2025, and September 29, 2024, was 15.8% and 7.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from the three months ended September 29, 2024, to the three months ended September 28, 2025, is primarily attributable to decreases in benefits related to reserves for uncertain tax positions, tax credits and the international provision of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

During the nine months ended September 28, 2025, we made $9.2 million of Robotics severance payments. We expect all Robotics severance payments to be made prior to the end of the third quarter of 2026. Additionally, we recorded $2.0 million of acquisition and divestiture expenses related primarily to the Quantifi Acquisition and $1.5 million of charges related to lease terminations.\n \nDuring the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recorded restructuring and other charges primarily related to $5.3\nmillion of severance and other charges, related to headcount reductions of 87 people primarily in Robotics and Semiconductor Test,\nwhich included charges related to a voluntary early retirement program for employees meeting certain conditions, and $2.2 million of\nacquisition and divestiture expenses related to the Technoprobe transactions.\n \nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recorded a gain of $57.5 million associated with the sale of DIS to Technoprobe.\n \nInterest and Other\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFor the Nine Months\n Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDollar\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(12.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(19.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nInterest income decreased by $7.1 million primarily due to lower cash balances.

The decrease in income before income taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliate in Robotics was primarily due to lower sales of collaborative robotic arms, partially offset by lower operating expenses. The decrease in income before income taxes and equity in net earnings of affiliate in Product Test was primarily due to strategic investments.\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n \nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2025, and September 29, 2024, was 13.8% and 12.0%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from the nine months ended September 29, 2024, to the nine months ended September 28, 2025, is primarily attributable to decreases in benefits related to reserves for uncertain tax positions and tax credits partially offset by an increase in benefit from a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income.\nContractual Obligations\n \nThere have been no changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances decreased by $296.4 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2025, to $427.4 million.\n \nOperating activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2025, provided cash of $392.8 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $48.6 million due to a $169.0 million increase in operating assets and a $120.5 million increase in operating liabilities.\n \nThe increase in operating assets was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepayments and other assets of $111.8 million, $34.6 million, and $22.6 million, respectively.\nThe increase in operating liabilities was due to increases in accounts payable and other liabilities and in deferred revenue and customer advances of $121.4 million and $25.7 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases in income taxes and retirement plans of $19.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively.\nInvesting activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2025, used cash of $307.7 million due to $161.1 million used for the purchase of property, plant & equipment, $144.4 million used for the acquisition of businesses, $27.5 million used for the purchase of marketable securities, and $25.5 million used for the purchase of investments in businesses, partially offset by $41.6 million and $9.2 million in proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities, respectively.\nFinancing activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2025, consumed cash of $361.4 million due to $518.7 million used for the repurchase of 5.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $102.01 per share, $57.6 million utilized for dividend payments and $15.3 million used for payment related to net settlements of employee stock compensation awards, partially offset by $200.0 million from borrowings on our revolving credit facility and $30.1 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans.\n \nOperating activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, provided cash of $389.6 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $75.8 million due to a $7.3 million decrease in operating assets and a $83.1 million decrease in operating liabilities.\n \nThe decrease in operating assets was primarily due to decreases in other assets and inventory of $61.4 million and $11.1 million, \nrespectively, partially offset by a $65.3 million increase in accounts receivable, driven by higher sales in the third quarter.\nThe decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $32.3 million decrease in accrued employee compensation, $25.9 million \ndecrease in accounts payable, $18.9 million decrease in income taxes, $4.2 million decrease in retirement plans, and $5.5 million \ndecrease in accrued other, partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances.\nInvesting activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, used cash of $554.9 million due to $527.1 million used\nfor the purchases of investment, $140.7 million used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, $35.1 million used for the\npurchase of marketable securities, partially offset by $90.3 million in proceeds from the sale of a business, $23.6 million and $33.2\nmillion in proceeds from the sales and maturities and marketable securities, respectively, and $0.9 million in proceeds from life\ninsurance.\n \nFinancing activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, used cash of $88.6 million due to $185.0 million used \nfor proceeds from borrowings on revolving credit facility of which $185.0 million in payments were paid back in full during the \nquarter, $56.9 million used for dividend payment, $55.1 million used for the repurchase of 0.5 million shares of common stock at an \n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage price of $111.32 per share and $13.8 million used for payment related to net settlements of employee stock compensation\nawards, partially offset by $37.3 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans.\n \nIn January 2025, May 2025 and August 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. Dividend payments for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2025, were $19.0 million and $57.6 million, respectively.\n \nIn January 2024, May 2024, and August 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. Dividend payments for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, were $19.6 million and $57.0 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2025, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of common stock for $518.7 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of $102.01 per share. We intend to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of common stock in 2025 and 2026, subject to market conditions. The cumulative repurchases under the 2023 repurchase program as of September 28, 2025, were 10.8 million shares of common stock for $1,113.8 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price per share of $104.21. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of common stock for $55.1 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of $111.32 per share.\n \nWhile we have previously declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. Cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, which will consider, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.\n \nOn May 1, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") providing a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. On December 10, 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the senior secured revolving credit facility to December 10, 2026. On October 5, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the amount of the credit facility to $750.0 million from $400.0 million. On November 7, 2023, the Credit Agreement was amended to allow for the purchase of the shares of Technoprobe. On September 4, 2025, and September 19, 2025, we borrowed a combined $200.0 million under the Credit Agreement to fund out capital allocation strategy. As of October 30, 2025, there is $250.0 million outstanding from the Credit Facility.\nWe believe our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings. As of September 28, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nEquity Compensation Plans\n \nIn addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Program as discussed in Note M: “Stock-Based Compensation” in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have a 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the “2006 Equity Plan”).\n \nThe purpose of the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is to encourage stock ownership by all eligible employees of Teradyne. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to provide equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne to our employees, officers and directors. Both plans were approved by our shareholders.\n \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 –\n“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”\n, which requires expanded disclosures relating to the tax rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and income tax expense (benefit), requiring a greater disaggregation of information for each. The provisions of ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We will apply the amendments in this update on a prospective basis. This ASU will have no impact on results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03-\n\"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income -Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\"\n, which requires disclosure of additional expense information on an annual and interim basis, including the amounts of inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible amortization included within each income statement expense caption.
