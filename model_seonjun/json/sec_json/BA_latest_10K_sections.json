  "item1": "Item 1. Business\nThe Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), is one of the world’s major aerospace firms.\nWe are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in three reportable segments:\n•\nCommercial Airplanes (BCA);\n•\nDefense, Space & Security (BDS);\n•\nGlobal Services (BGS).\nCommercial Airplanes Segment\nThis segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and the 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. Development continues on the 777X program and the 737-7 and 737-10 derivatives.\nDefense, Space & Security Segment\nThis segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for strike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift, including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; and commercial derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft. In addition, this segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: strategic defense and intelligence systems, including strategic missile and defense systems, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and information solutions, and intelligence systems, satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration.\nGlobal Services Segment\nThis segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers worldwide. Global Services sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a full spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare parts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital services.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual \n1\nTable of Contents\nproperty rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, Boeing’s total workforce was approximately 172,000 with 15% located outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, our global workforce was comprised of approximately 24% women, and our U.S. workforce was comprised of 39% racial and ethnic minorities and 14% U.S. veterans.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our workforce included approximately 58,000 union members. Our principal collective bargaining agreements and their current status are summarized in the following table:\nUnion\nPercent of our Total Workforce Represented\nStatus of Major Agreements with Union\nThe International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)\n21%\nWe have two major agreements; one with IAM District 837 (Missouri) expiring in July 2025 and one with IAM District 751 (Washington) expiring in September 2028.\nThe Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA)\n10%\nWe have two major agreements; one with SPEEA Professional and one with SPEEA Technical, both expiring in October 2026.\nThe United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)\n1%\nWe have one major agreement with UAW District 1069 (Pennsylvania) expiring in April 2027.\nOur prior contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) expired on September 12, 2024, and 96% of IAM 751 members voted to initiate a strike. The strike lasted until November 4, 2024, when IAM 751 members voted to ratify a new contract. As a result of the strike, we paused production of our commercial aircraft (other than the 787 production in Charleston) and certain of our BDS products, adversely impacting our business and financial position. During the strike, we implemented hiring freezes and announced plans to reduce our overall workforce. For information on risks related to our human capital, see “Risks Related to Our Business and Operations” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are committed to creating a work environment where every teammate around the world can perform at their best and grow their careers while supporting our company’s mission to protect, connect and explore our world and beyond. Our compensation program is designed to attract, reward and retain the best-qualified talent with competitive compensation and benefits, including healthcare, paid time off, parental leave, retirement benefits, tuition assistance, employee skills and leadership development programs, and mental and physical well-being programs. We also invest in rewarding performance and have established a multi-level recognition program to acknowledge the achievements of excellent individual or team performance.\n2\nTable of Contents\nWe support our employees’ continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills through access to digital learning resources and partnerships with leading professional/technical societies and organizations around the world. In 2024, Boeing employees completed approximately 5.9 million hours of learning and approximately 14,000 Boeing employees leveraged our tuition assistance program to pursue degrees, professional certificates and individual courses in strategic fields of study.\nSafety, quality, integrity and sustainability are at the core of how Boeing operates. We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. Employees are required on an annual basis to sign the Boeing Code of Conduct to reaffirm their commitment to do their work in a compliant and ethical manner. Additionally, we continue to focus on creating a culture where all employees feel empowered to speak up and provide multiple channels for all employees to ask for guidance and report concerns, including those related to ethics, safety or quality. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\nCompetition\nThe commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus and entrants from China. We are focused on improving our products and processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other aircraft manufacturers by providing customers with airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, quality, efficiency and value to customers around the world.\nBDS faces strong competition primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, RTX Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2025.\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial aircraft programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2025, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\nRegulatory Matters\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\nGovernment Contracts.\n The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, \n3\nTable of Contents\nnet of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\nCommercial Aircraft.\n In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. For example, as a result of the Alaska Airlines 737-9 accident in January 2024, the FAA investigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its oversight of our production and quality and safety management systems. In addition, the FAA communicated it will not approve production rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until \nBoeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. \nNew aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into service. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.\nEnvironmental.\n We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the utilization, discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could also be affected by laws and regulations relating to climate change, including laws limiting or otherwise related to greenhouse gas emissions. These laws and regulations could lead to increased environmental compliance expenditures, increased energy and raw materials costs and new and/or additional investment in designs and technologies. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to monitor compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-U.S. Sales.\n Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.\nRaw Materials, Parts and Subassemblies\nWe are highly dependent on the availability and quality of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis. We continue to work with a small number of sole-source suppliers to ensure continuity of supply for certain items.\nSuppliers\nWe are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk \n4\nTable of Contents\nassociated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments has and could continue to adversely affect product quality, production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We have also experienced significant increases in supplier prices which are adversely affecting our business. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.\nSeasonality\nNo material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nSee “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” in Part III.\nOther Information\nBoeing was originally incorporated in the State of Washington in 1916 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1934. Our principal executive offices are located at 929 Long Bridge Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22202, and our telephone number is (703) 465-3500.\nGeneral information about us can be found at www.boeing.com.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOverview\nWe are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.\nOur strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS) and Global Services (BGS). BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, quality, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets. BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive and cost-competitive product and service solutions. \nOn January 5, 2024, an Alaska Airlines 737-9 flight made an emergency landing after a mid-exit door plug detached in flight. Following the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded and required inspections of all 737-9 aircraft with a mid-exit door plug, which constituted the large majority of the approximately 220 737-9 aircraft in the in-service fleet. On January 24, 2024, the FAA approved an enhanced maintenance and inspection process that was required to be performed on each of the grounded 737-9 aircraft. Our 737-9 operators returned their fleets to service in the first quarter. All 737-9 aircraft in production are undergoing this same enhanced inspection process prior to delivery.\nAs a result of the accident, the FAA performed an investigation into the 737 quality control system. In the second quarter of 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified. As part of our plan to improve quality and safety and to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce traveled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers. We also began taking additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture.\nThe Alaska Airlines accident and our resulting actions, including slowing production, to improve compliance with our manufacturing quality control requirements significantly impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows during 2024.\nOn November 4, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) voted to ratify a new contract, thereby ending the work stoppage initiated on September 13, 2024, which paused production of certain commercial aircraft models (737, 767, 777 and 777X aircraft) as well as production of commercial derivative aircraft for our Defense, Space & Security business (KC-46A Tanker and P-8A Poseidon). Production for all programs resumed in December 2024.\nThe IAM 751 work stoppage significantly reduced aircraft deliveries in the second half of 2024. The new contract with IAM 751 and pay enhancements for certain non-union employees is adversely impacting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n24\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nIn 2024, global air traffic continued to expand beyond 2019 levels with domestic travel continuing to be the most robust and the single-aisle market following closely. International travel also surpassed pre-pandemic levels during 2024 and the wide-body market continues to improve with the international travel recovery. The transition in the international commercial market from recovery to normal market conditions is continuing to progress as China international travel remains below 2019 levels. We are experiencing strong demand from our airline customers globally.\nWe and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of production quality issues, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAirline financial performance, which influences demand for new capacity, has benefited from the resilient demand for travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is estimating 2024 industry-wide net profits of $31.5 billion, up from its forecast of $25.7 billion a year ago, primarily driven by North America, Europe and the Middle East. For 2025, IATA is forecasting $36.6 billion in net profits for the industry globally. The overall outlook continues to stabilize as we face uncertainties in the environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing persistently high and volatile costs. The global economy is expecting a continued easing of inflation and interest rates, with regional economic and geopolitical difficulties adding uncertainty to the outlook and the financial viability of some airlines and regions.\nThe long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.2% growth rate in the global fleet over a 20-year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.6% in average annual gross domestic product, we project demand for approximately 43,975 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, potential new or increased tariffs, changing energy policies, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.\nAt BDS, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and services have in ensuring our national security. Outside of the U.S., we are seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving threats. We continue to experience production disruptions and inefficiencies due to technical challenges, supplier disruption and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on fixed-price development programs as well as on a number of mature programs which are continuing to adversely affect margins and cash flows.\nAt BGS, we expect commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry has largely recovered and transitions to growth. The demand outlook for our government services business remains stable.\n25\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n \nThe following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$66,517\n \n$77,794 \n$66,608 \nGAAP\nLoss from operations\n($10,707)\n($773)\n($3,519)\nOperating margins\n(16.1)\n%\n(1.0)\n%\n(5.3)\n%\nEffective income tax rate\n3.1\n \n%\n(11.8)\n%\n(0.6)\n%\nNet loss attributable to Boeing shareholders\n($11,817)\n($2,222)\n($4,935)\nDiluted loss per share\n($18.36)\n($3.67)\n($8.30)\nNon-GAAP \n(1)\nCore operating loss\n($11,811)\n($1,829)\n($4,662)\nCore operating margins\n(17.8)\n%\n(2.4)\n%\n(7.0)\n%\nCore loss per share\n($20.38)\n($5.81)\n($11.06)\n(1)\nThese measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

BCA revenues decreased by $11,040 million primarily driven by lower deliveries across all programs and 737-9 customer considerations related to the January 2024 grounding. BDS revenues decreased by $1,015 million primarily due to higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments on major fixed-price development programs. BGS revenues increased by $827 million primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. \nRevenues increased by $11,186 million in 2023 compared with 2022 driven by higher revenues at all three operating segments. BCA revenues increased by $7,875 million primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $1,771 million primarily due to higher revenues on fixed-price development programs. BGS revenues increased by $1,516 million primarily due to higher commercial services revenue driven by market recovery across the commercial portfolio. \nWe expect that revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until deliveries ramp up, the global supply chain stabilizes, and labor instability diminishes.\n26\nTable of Contents\nLoss From Operations\n \nThe following table summarizes Loss from operations:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommercial Airplanes\n($7,969)\n($1,635)\n($2,341)\nDefense, Space & Security\n(5,413)\n(1,764)\n(3,544)\nGlobal Services\n3,618\n \n3,329 \n2,727 \nSegment operating loss\n(9,764)\n(70)\n(3,158)\nUnallocated items, eliminations and other\n(2,047)\n(1,759)\n(1,504)\nPension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n811\n \n799 \n849 \nPostretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n293\n \n257 \n294 \nLoss from operations (GAAP)\n($10,707)\n($773)\n($3,519)\nFAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(1)\n(1,104)\n(1,056)\n(1,143)\nCore operating loss (Non-GAAP)\n(2)\n($11,811)\n($1,829)\n($4,662)\n(1)\n    The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.\n(2)\n    Core operating loss is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See pages 46 - 48.\nLoss from operations increased by $9,934 million in 2024 compared with 2023. BCA loss from operations increased by $6,334 million primarily due to reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, 737-9 customer considerations related to the January 2024 grounding, lower deliveries, and lower margins driven by production disruption including the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement, and higher research and development expense, partially offset by lower abnormal production costs. BDS loss from operations increased by $3,649 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2024 on major fixed-price development programs. BGS earnings from operations increased by $289 million in 2024 compared with 2023 primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. Loss from operations on Unallocated items, eliminations and other increased by $288 million in 2024 primarily due to an increase in eliminations and other unallocated items expense, partially offset by an increase in share-based plans income.\nLoss from operations decreased by $2,746 million in 2023 compared with 2022. BDS loss from operations decreased by $1,780 million compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a reduction in net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $2,328 million better than the net unfavorable impact in the prior year. BCA loss from operations decreased by $706 million reflecting higher deliveries and lower period expenses including lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher spending on research and development. BGS earnings from operations increased by $602 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. Loss from operations on Unallocated items, eliminations and other increased by $255 million in 2023 primarily due to higher deferred compensation expense.\nCore operating loss increased by $9,982 million in 2024 compared with 2023 and decreased by $2,833 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to changes in Segment operating loss as described above.\n27\nTable of Contents\nUnallocated Items, Eliminations and Other \n \nThe most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other (expense)/income are shown in the following table:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShare-based plans\n$171\n \n$62 \n($114)\nDeferred compensation\n(114)\n(188)\n117 \nAmortization of previously capitalized interest\n(93)\n(95)\n(95)\nResearch and development expense, net\n(377)\n(315)\n(278)\nEliminations and other unallocated items\n(1,634)\n(1,223)\n(1,134)\nUnallocated items, eliminations and other\n($2,047)\n($1,759)\n($1,504)\nShare-based plans income increased by $109 million in 2024 primarily due to fewer outstanding share-based awards in 2024 and the timing of corporate allocations. Share-based plans expense decreased by $176 million in 2023 primarily due to fewer share-based grants and the timing of corporate allocations.\nDeferred compensation expense decreased by $74 million in 2024 primarily driven by changes in our stock price. Deferred compensation expense increased by $305 million in 2023 primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions.\nResearch and development expense increased by $62 million in 2024 and $37 million in 2023 primarily due to increased spending on enterprise product development.\nEliminations and other unallocated items expense increased by $411 million in 2024 primarily due to a second quarter earnings charge of $244 million that reflects a fine that would be paid if an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice is approved by the federal district court.

The decreased income in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets and higher amortization of net actuarial losses, partially offset by lower interest cost. The decreased non-operating pension income in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher interest cost and lower expected return on plan assets, partially offset by lower amortization of net actuarial losses.\nNon-operating postretirement income included in Other income, net was $73 million in 2024 and $58 million in 2023 and 2022. The increased income in 2024 was primarily due to lower interest cost, partially offset by amortization of prior service credits. \nFor additional discussion related to Postretirement Plans, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest and debt expense increased by $266 million in 2024 primarily due to higher average debt balances. Interest and debt expense decreased by $102 million in 2023 primarily due to lower average debt balances.\nFor a discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial aircraft program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes cost of sales:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nCost of sales\n$68,508\n \n$70,070 \n($1,562)\n$70,070 \n$63,078 \n$6,992 \nCost of sales as a % of Revenues\n103.0\n \n%\n90.1 \n%\n12.9 \n%\n90.1 \n%\n94.7 \n%\n(4.6)\n%\nCost of sales decreased by $1,562 million in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to lower revenues at BCA, partially offset by the reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs and higher charges on the BDS fixed-price development programs. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, lower margins at BCA, and higher charges on the BDS fixed-price development programs.\nCost of sales increased by $6,992 million in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily due to higher revenues at BCA and BGS, partially offset by lower development charges at BDS.

The increase in contractual backlog during 2024 was primarily due to an increase in BDS and BGS backlog that was partially offset by a decrease in BCA backlog. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.\nUnobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Unobligated backlog was largely unchanged in 2024.\nAdditional Considerations\nU.S. Government Funding\n \nConsiderable uncertainty exists regarding how future U.S. government budget and program decisions will unfold, including the spending priorities of the new Administration and Congress.\nThe Continuing Resolution (CR) enacted on December 21, 2024, continues federal funding at fiscal year 2024 appropriated levels through March 14, 2025. Congress and the President must enact either full-year fiscal year 2025 (FY25) appropriations bills or an additional CR to fund government departments and agencies after March 14, 2025, or a government shutdown could result. We rely on the U.S. government in various aspects of our defense, commercial and service businesses. In the event of a shutdown, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD), the Department of Transportation, including the FAA, or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts or otherwise impact our operations, negatively impact future orders, and/or cause other disruptions or delays.\nThe U.S. government could experience a disruption to its operations and/or payments in 2025 as a result of the U.S. Treasury exhausting extraordinary measures after reaching its debt limit. In addition, U.S. government discretionary spending in FY24 and fiscal year 2025 (FY25), including defense spending, was capped by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA). If a CR for FY25 is in place on April 30, 2025, it would trigger a sequester under the FRA. These potential disruptions, and any broader macroeconomic impacts, could affect our current programs and contracts and have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. \n31\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Trade \nThe global trade landscape is growing more volatile, and the likelihood of new or reciprocal tariffs, export restrictions, sanctions or other restrictions is increasing. We continually monitor the global trade environment and any changes in tariffs, trade agreements, restrictions or sanctions that may impact the Company or our suppliers or customers, and work to mitigate potential impacts.\nThe current state of U.S.-China relations remains an ongoing watch item. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft and we have long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains stalled as economic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge.\nWe seek to comply with all U.S. and other government export control restrictions and sanctions. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and export restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government or other governments, as well as any responses that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers, for any additional impacts to our business.\nSupply Chain \nWe and our suppliers are experiencing inflationary pressures, as well as supply chain disruptions as a result of global supply chain constraints and labor instability. Certain of our suppliers are also experiencing financial difficulties. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During 2024, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $\n1,770\n million on the T-7A Red Hawk program that was primarily driven by projected increases in supplier cost estimates. In addition, we recorded losses on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs that were partially attributable to higher supplier costs.\nSegment Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nCommercial Airplanes\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nAirline Industry Environment \nSee Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the airline industry environment.\nIndustry Competitiveness \nThe commercial aircraft market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 80% of BCA’s total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.\n32\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations \n \n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$22,861\n \n$33,901 \n$26,026 \n% of total company revenues\n34\n \n%\n44 \n%\n39 \n%\nLoss from operations\n($7,969)\n($1,635)\n($2,341)\nOperating margins\n(34.9)\n%\n(4.8)\n%\n(9.0)\n%\nResearch and development\n$2,386\n \n$2,036 \n$1,510 \nRevenues \n \nBCA revenues decreased by $11,040 million in 2024 compared with 2023 primarily due to lower deliveries across all programs and 737-9 customer considerations related to the January 2024 grounding.\nBCA revenues increased by $7,875 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to higher 787 deliveries in 2023.\nBCA deliveries, including intercompany deliveries, as of December 31 were as follows:\n737\n \n*\n747\n \n767\n \n*\n777\n \n787\n \nTotal\n2024\nCumulative deliveries\n8,793\n1,573\n1,321\n1,741\n1,161\nDeliveries\n265\n(5)\n18\n(8)\n14\n51\n348\n2023\nCumulative deliveries\n8,528\n1,573\n1,303\n1,727\n1,110\nDeliveries\n396\n(9)\n1\n32\n(14)\n26\n73\n528\n2022\nCumulative deliveries\n8,132\n1,572\n1,271\n1,701\n1,037\nDeliveries\n387\n(13)\n5\n33\n(15)\n24\n31\n480\n*\n Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses\nLoss From Operations \n \nBCA loss from operations was $7,969 million in 2024 compared with $1,635 million in 2023 reflecting reach-forward losses of $4,079 million on the 777X and 767 programs in the third and fourth quarter of 2024, $443 million of 737-9 customer considerations related to the January 2024 grounding, lower deliveries, lower margins driven by production disruption including the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement, and higher research and development expense, partially offset by $1,271 million of lower abnormal production costs. \nBCA loss from operations was $1,635 million in 2023 compared with $2,341 million in 2022 reflecting higher deliveries and lower period expenses including lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher spending on research and development. Abnormal production costs in 2023 were $1,527 million, including $1,014 million related to the 787 program and $513 million related to the 777X program. Abnormal production costs in 2022 were $1,753 million, including $1,240 million related to the 787 program, $325 million related to the 777X program, and $188 million related to the 737 program. \n33\nTable of Contents\nBacklog\nOur total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.\nBCA total backlog of $435,175 million at December 31, 2024 decreased from $440,507 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase in the value of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, cancellations and decreases in estimated contractual prices, partially offset by new orders in excess of deliveries. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $11,311 million and primarily related to 737 aircraft. Net ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $16,553 million and primarily related to 777X aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.\nAccounting Quantity\n The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.\nThe accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include certain military derivative aircraft that are not included in program accounting quantities. All revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDS segment.\nProgram\n737\n \n747\n \n**\n767\n \n777\n \n777X\n787\n \n†\n2024\nProgram accounting quantities\n11,600\n1,263\n1,822\n500\n \n1,800\nUndelivered units under firm orders\n4,303\n*\n109\n68\n358\n719\n(8)\nCumulative firm orders\n13,096\n1,430\n1,809\n358\n1,880\n2023\nProgram accounting quantities\n11,600\n1,574\n1,279\n1,790\n500\n1,700\nUndelivered units under firm orders\n4,332\n*\n104\n48\n416\n726\n(8)\nCumulative firm orders\n12,860\n1,573\n1,407\n1,775\n416\n1,836\n2022\nProgram accounting quantities\n10,800\n1,574\n1,267\n1,790\n400\n1,600\nUndelivered units under firm orders\n3,653\n*\n1\n106\n69\n244\n505\n(8)\nCumulative firm orders\n11,785\n1,573\n1,377\n1,770\n244\n1,542\n†\n Customer financing aircraft orders are identified in parentheses.\n*\nApproximate undelivered orders by minor model in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively: 737-7 (7%, 7%, 6%), 737-8 (63%, 65%, 70%), 737-9 (5%, 3%, 4%) and 737-10 (25%, 25%, 20%).\n** We completed production of the 747 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and delivery of the last aircraft occurred in February 2023.\nProgram Highlights\n737 Program \nIn January 2024, an Alaska Airlines 737-9 flight made an emergency landing after a mid-exit door plug detached in flight. Following the accident, the FAA grounded and required inspections of all 737-9 aircraft with a mid-exit door plug. All 737-9 aircraft returned to service in the first quarter of 2024. \nAs a result of the accident, the FAA investigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its oversight of Boeing’s production and quality and safety management systems. In addition, the FAA communicated it will not approve production rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until \nBoeing has complied with required quality and safety standards.\n \nThe FAA communicated findings from its investigation in February 2024 and identified multiple instances where Boeing and Spirit failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. In the second quarter of 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified. We also began taking additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture. \n35\nTable of Contents\nPrior to the Alaska Airlines accident, we were operating at a production rate of 38 per month. As part of our plan to improve quality and safety and to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce traveled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers. These actions also include conducting fuselage inspections at Spirit to improve quality prior to shipment to Boeing. \nProduction was paused on September 13, 2024, because of the work stoppage initiated by IAM 751. A new IAM 751 contract was ratified in November 2024, and production resumed in early December 2024. Prior to the work stoppage, production rates gradually increased in 2024 as we implemented new processes aligned with our safety and quality plan. We plan to gradually increase the production rate. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 55 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including approximately 40 aircraft for customers in China. We expect to deliver these aircraft in 2025.\nWe are continuing to work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models, which have been delayed, while we work through the engineering solution for the engine anti-ice system for the 737-7 and 737-10 prior to certification of these minor models. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\nThe production slow-down, the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement, and the timing of minor model certifications have had an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows during 2024. If we are unable to deliver aircraft and/or increase future production rates, or certify the 737-7 and 737-10 models consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will continue to be adversely affected.\nSee further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 8 and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\n.\n767 Program\n The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. We are currently targeting a production rate of approximately 3 aircraft per month. Prior to the IAM 751 work stoppage, we experienced factory disruption, including supply chain delays and quality issues. We slowed production to reduce traveled work and enable supply chain recovery, which resulted in higher near-term production costs. Production resumed in December 2024. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we decided to end production of the 767 freighter program in 2027 and, as a result of this decision, we reduced the accounting quantity for the 767 program by 9 units. Impacts of this decision, as well as the IAM 751 work stoppage and contract negotiations, and higher costs driven by ongoing factory disruption resulted in a reach-forward loss of $398 million during the third quarter of 2024.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we reduced the accounting quantity by 7 units. We now expect to end production in late 2026 or early 2027. We recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $182 million as a result of the reduction in the accounting quantity and the new IAM 751 agreement.\nSee further discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n777 and 777X Programs\n The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 32 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The accounting quantity for the 777X program remained unchanged during 2024.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently targeting a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X programs having resumed production in December 2024. In July 2024, we obtained approval from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, based on flight test delays and our revised assessment of certification timelines, the anticipated first delivery of the 777-9 was delayed to 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter moved to 2028. First delivery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. In addition, we decided to slow the production rate ramp of 777X to address production challenges, which resulted in higher production costs and further customer delivery delays. As a result of these changes, as well as higher estimated labor and supplier costs, we recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss during the third quarter of 2024. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X program primarily due to higher costs as a result of the new IAM 751 agreement.\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\nThe level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to several factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, delivery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n787 Program\n The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. During 2024, we slowed production to below 5 per month due to supply chain constraints as well as other production issues. While we continue to be impacted by performance challenges and supply chain constraints, we are working to increase production rates. Delays associated with business class seats adversely impacted 2024 deliveries and will continue to impact deliveries in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 25 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. We expect to complete the rework and deliver the majority of these aircraft in 2025. The inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are accounted for as abnormal production costs, and we expensed $256 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nFleet Support\n We provide the operators of our commercial aircraft with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\nAdditional Considerations\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n37\nTable of Contents\nDefense, Space & Security\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nOverview\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, enacted in March 2024, provided fiscal year 2024 appropriations for government departments and agencies, including $844 billion for the U.S. DoD and $25 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). They included funding for Boeing’s major programs, including P-8, CH-47 Chinook, F-15, KC-46A Tanker, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, and Space Launch System.\nIn March 2024, the U.S. government released the President's budget request for FY25, which requested $850 billion in funding for the U.S. DoD and $25 billion for NASA.\nThere is ongoing uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD, NASA and other government agencies for FY25 and beyond. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financing position, and/or cash flows.\n \nThe non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2024, 29% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.\nResults of Operations \n \n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$23,918\n \n$24,933 \n$23,162 \n% of total company revenues\n36\n \n%\n32 \n%\n35 \n%\nLoss from operations\n($5,413)\n($1,764)\n($3,544)\nOperating margins\n(22.6)\n%\n(7.1)\n%\n(15.3)\n%\nSince our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular period may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.\n38\nTable of Contents\nDeliveries of new-build production units, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nF/A-18 Models\n11\n \n22 \n14 \nF-15 Models\n14\n \n9 \n12 \nT-7A Red Hawk\n2\n \n3 \nCH-47 Chinook (New)\n4\n \n11 \n19 \nCH-47 Chinook (Renewed)\n9\n \n9 \n9 \nAH-64 Apache (New)\n16\n \n20 \n25 \nAH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)\n34\n \n57 \n50 \nMH-139 Grey Wolf\n6\n \n2 \n4 \nKC-46 Tanker\n10\n \n13 \n15 \nP-8 Models\n4\n \n11 \n12 \nCommercial Satellites\n2\n \n5\n4\nMilitary Satellites\n1\nTotal\n112\n \n162 \n165 \nRevenues \n \nBDS revenues in 2024 decreased by $1,015 million compared with 2023. The decrease is primarily due to higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments of $909 million on BDS’ five major fixed-price development programs. Overall, net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2024 were $995 million higher than 2023. \nBDS revenues in 2023 increased by $1,771 million compared with 2022. Revenues related to BDS’ five major fixed-price development programs increased by $1,767 million in 2023 compared with 2022. This increase reflects lower unfavorable net cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 as well as higher costs incurred in 2023 to complete these contracts. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 were $648 million better than in 2022 largely due to lower charges on development programs in 2023, partially offset by unfavorable performance on other programs. \nLoss From Operations \n \nBDS loss from operations in 2024 was $5,413 million compared with $1,764 million in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments of $3,428 million on BDS’ five major fixed-price development programs compared to 2023. During 2024, losses incurred on the five major fixed-price development programs totaled $5,013 million, including KC-46A Tanker ($2,002 million), T-7A Red Hawk ($1,770 million), Commercial Crew ($523 million), VC-25B ($379 million), and MQ-25 ($339 million). Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $3,534 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year. See further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBDS loss from operations in 2023 of $1,764 million decreased by $1,780 million compared with $3,544 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to $2,863 million of lower charges in 2023 on fixed-price development programs that were partially offset by lower earnings across other programs including satellites and F-15, as well as higher period expenses. During 2023, losses incurred on the five fixed-price development programs totaled $1,585 million compared with $4,448 million in 2022. Charges on fixed-price development programs in 2023 included VC-25B ($482 million), KC-46A Tanker ($309 million), Commercial Crew ($288 million), T-7A Red Hawk ($275 million) and MQ-25 ($231 million). Loss from operations in 2023 includes a $315 million impact from an agreement with one of our satellite customers which includes customer considerations as well as increased costs to enhance the \n39\nTable of Contents\nconstellation and meet lifecycle commitments. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022. \nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nBDS loss from operations includes our share of income from equity method investments of $125 million, $44 million and $13 million primarily from our United Launch Alliance and other joint ventures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nBacklog\nTotal backlog of $64,023 million at December 31, 2024 was $5,011 million higher than December 31, 2023, reflecting the timing of awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\nAdditional Considerations\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\nGlobal Services\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional services; and data analytics and digital services. We expect BGS commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry transitions from recovery to growth. \nOver the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2024. Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at faster rates. We expect approximately 30 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.\nBGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.\nIndustry Competitiveness \nAviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.\nResults of Operations \n \n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$19,954\n \n$19,127 \n$17,611 \n% of total company revenues\n30\n \n%\n25 \n%\n26 \n%\nEarnings from operations\n$3,618\n \n$3,329 \n$2,727 \nOperating margins\n18.1\n \n%\n17.4 \n%\n15.5 \n%\nRevenues \n \nBGS revenues in 2024 increased by $827 million compared with 2023 primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. The net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2024 was $96 million higher than the prior year comparable period.\nBGS revenues in 2023 increased by $1,516 million compared with 2022 primarily due to higher commercial services revenue driven by market recovery across the commercial portfolio. The net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 was $16 million worse than the net favorable impact in the prior year comparable period.\nEarnings From Operations \n \nBGS earnings from operations in 2024 increased by $289 million compared with 2023, primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. The net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2024 was $94 million higher than the prior year.\nBGS earnings from operations in 2023 increased by $602 million compared with 2022, primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. The net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 was $9 million higher than the prior year.\nBacklog\nBGS total backlog of $21,403 million at December 31, 2024 increased by 8% from $19,869 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to the timing of awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow Summary \n \n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet loss\n($11,829)\n($2,242)\n($5,053)\nNon-cash items\n8,517\n \n4,113 \n4,426 \nChanges in assets and liabilities\n(8,768)\n4,089 \n4,139 \nNet cash (used)/provided by operating activities\n(12,080)\n5,960 \n3,512 \nNet cash (used)/provided by investing activities\n(11,973)\n(2,437)\n4,370 \nNet cash provided/(used) by financing activities\n25,209\n \n(5,487)\n(1,266)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(47)\n30 \n(73)\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash & cash equivalents, including restricted\n1,109\n \n(1,934)\n6,543 \nCash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at beginning of year\n12,713\n \n14,647 \n8,104 \nCash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at end of year\n$13,822\n \n$12,713 \n$14,647 \nOperating Activities\n Net cash used by operating activities was $12.1 billion during 2024 compared with net cash provided of $6.0 billion during 2023. The increase in cash outflows from operating activities in 2024 was primarily driven by our commercial airplanes business. Commercial airplane cash outflows reflect slowed and/or paused production and lower deliveries as a result of ongoing safety and quality improvement actions the Company is taking following the Alaska Airlines accident on January 5, 2024, supply chain constraints, and the IAM 751 work stoppage.\nThe higher net loss of $11.8 billion during 2024 compared to $2.2 billion in 2023 primarily reflects higher losses from operations at BCA and BDS. The change in Non-cash items is primarily due to the 777X and 767 reach-forward losses of $4.1 billion recorded in 2024. \nChanges in assets and liabilities for 2024 decreased by $12.9 billion compared to 2023 primarily driven by unfavorable changes in Inventories ($10.7 billion), Accounts payable ($2.5 billion) and Unbilled receivables ($0.4 billion), partially offset by changes in Accrued Liabilities ($0.8 billion) and Advances and progress billings ($0.7 billion). The growth in Inventories was primarily driven by lower deliveries on our commercial airplane programs during 2024 as compared to 2023. Changes in Accounts payable during 2024 compared to 2023 reflects slowed/paused production primarily in our commercial airplanes business. The increase in Unbilled receivables during 2024 was primarily driven by revenue recognized in excess of billings at BDS compared to higher billings at BDS and BGS during 2023. The increase in Accrued liabilities was primarily driven by higher accrued losses on BDS fixed-price development programs. Concessions paid to 737 MAX customers totaled $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion during 2024 and 2023. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings during 2024 was $4.1 billion compared to cash provided of $3.4 billion during 2023. \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion during 2023 compared with $3.5 billion during 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 included a $1.5 billion income tax refund. The year-over-year improvement in cash provided by operating activities reflects increases in revenues at BCA and BGS, higher Advances and progress billings ($3.3 billion) and lower payments to 737 MAX customers ($0.6 billion), partially offset by increased Inventories ($2.1 billion). Increases in Accrued liabilities in both years primarily reflects accrued reach-forward losses on BDS programs. Changes in assets and liabilities for 2023 decreased by $0.1 billion compared to 2022 primarily driven by unfavorable changes in Inventories ($2.1 billion) and Accrued liabilities ($2.2 billion), partially offset by \n42\nTable of Contents\nincreases in Advances and progress billings ($3.3 billion). The change in Inventories was primarily driven by increased production on the 737 and 777X programs, partially offset by increased deliveries for the 787 program in 2023. The change in Accrued liabilities was primarily driven by higher accrued losses on BDS fixed-price development programs recorded in the prior year. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $3.4 billion in 2023 as compared with $0.1 billion in 2022. Concessions paid to 737 MAX customers totaled $0.4 billion in 2023 and $1.0 billion in 2022. \nPayables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs decreased by $0.2 billion in 2024, and increased by $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion in 2023 and 2022. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity.\nInvesting Activities\n Cash used by investing activities during 2024 was $12.0 billion, compared with cash used of $2.4 billion during 2023 and cash provided by investment activities of $4.4 billion during 2022. The increase in cash used in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to net contributions to investments of $9.1 billion in 2024 compared to $0.7 billion in 2023. The increase in cash outflows in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to net contributions to investments of $0.7 billion in 2023 compared to net proceeds from investments of $5.6 billion in 2022. Capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion in 2024, compared with $1.5 billion in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2022. We expect capital expenditures to grow in 2025 compared with 2024.\nFinancing Activities\n Cash provided by financing activities was $25.2 billion during 2024, compared with cash used of $5.5 billion during 2023, and $1.3 billion in 2022. Cash provided by financing activities during 2024 was primarily driven by the issuance of common stock and Mandatory convertible preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2024, which resulted in cash proceeds of $18.2 billion and $5.7 billion, net of issuance costs, as well as the issuance of $10.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in the second quarter of 2024. During 2024, net borrowings were $1.5 billion compared to net repayments of $5.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2023 and 2022.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023 debt balances totaled $53.9 billion and $52.3 billion, of which $1.3 billion and $5.2 billion were classified as short-term.\nWe had 0.4 million, 1.7 million and 0.2 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the vesting of a one-time RSU grant awarded to most employees in December 2020. In 2020, we announced the suspension of our dividend to common shareholders until further notice. As a result, we did not pay any dividends to common shareholders in 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nCapital Resources\nThe following table summarizes certain cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024, and the estimated timing thereof. See Note 13 for future operating lease payments.\n(Dollars in millions)\nCurrent\nLong-term\nTotal\nLong-term debt (including current portion)\n$1,268 \n$53,101 \n$54,369 \nInterest on debt\n2,594 \n38,386 \n40,980 \nPension and other postretirement\n470 \n7,761 \n8,231 \nPurchase obligations\n67,034 \n79,141 \n146,175 \n43\nTable of Contents\nDuring 2024, net cash used by operating activities was $12.1 billion. The cash outflow was primarily driven by our commercial airplanes business. Commercial airplanes cash outflows reflect slowed production and lower deliveries following the Alaska Airlines accident, supply chain constraints and the IAM 751 work stoppage.\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit in an all-stock transaction at an equity value of approximately $4.7 billion, or $37.25 per share of Spirit Class A Common Stock. The transaction will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $13.8 billion of cash, $12.5 billion of short-term investments, and $10.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. In the second quarter of 2024, we entered into a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in May 2029. In the second quarter of 2024, we terminated the $0.8 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in August 2024, and the $3.2 billion five-year revolving credit agreement, as amended, that was scheduled to expire in October 2024. Our $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2025 and $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2028 each remain in effect. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. At December 31, 2024 we were in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit facility agreements.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings; however, Moody’s downgraded our short term and long term credit ratings to Baa3/P-3 in April 2024. Moody's and S&P placed our ratings on review for downgrade in September 2024 and October 2024, respectively. In January 2025, Moody’s affirmed the Baa3/P-3 investment grade credit rating with negative outlook.\nWe expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding to support our operations, pay off existing debt, address impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements; however, a number of factors could increase the cost of borrowing, jeopardize our ability to incur debt on terms acceptable to us, and negatively impact our access to the capital and financial markets and our ability to fund our operations and commitments. These factors include further downgrades in our credit ratings, disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, a decline in our financial performance or, outlook, a delay in our ability to ramp up production and deliveries, and changes in demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments. See “Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.\nAny future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, our pension plans were $4.8 billion and $5.4 billion underfunded as measured under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). On an ERISA basis, our plans are more than 90% funded at December 31, 2024. We do not expect to make significant contributions \n44\nTable of Contents\nto our pension plans in 2025. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to use common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans. \nPurchase Obligations\n Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nPurchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, information technology software and hardware, aircraft trade-ins, property, plant and equipment, electricity and natural gas contracts, tooling costs, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts with customers and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.\nPurchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities, including accrued compensation and product warranties.\nWe have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in some instances, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2024, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $15.5 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n45\nTable of Contents\nCommercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal Amounts\nCommitted/Maximum\nAmount of Loss\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3\nyears\n4-5\nyears\nAfter 5\nyears\nStandby letters of credit and surety bonds\n$2,991 \n$1,944 \n$880 \n$12 \n$155 \nCommercial aircraft financing commitments\n17,124 \n3,449 \n7,673 \n4,046 \n1,956 \nTotal commercial commitments\n$20,115 \n$5,393 \n$8,553 \n$4,058 \n$2,111 \nCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Customer financing commitments totaled $17.1 billion and $17.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContingent Obligations\nWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:\nLegal\n Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Remediation\n We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $834 million at December 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nCore Operating Earnings/(Loss), Core Operating Margins and Core Earnings/(Loss) Per Share\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings/(loss) per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement income. Non-operating pension and postretirement income represents the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions \n46\nTable of Contents\nand accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.\nThe Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $811 million in 2024, $799 million in 2023 and $849 million in 2022. The higher benefits in 2024 were primarily due to increases in allocated pension cost year over year, while the lower benefits in 2023 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was $476 million in 2024, $529 million in 2023 and $881 million in 2022. The lower benefits in 2024 were primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets and higher amortization of net actuarial losses, partially offset by lower interest costs. The lower benefits in 2023 were primarily due to higher interest costs and lower expected return on plan assets, offset by lower amortization of net actuarial losses. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on page 28 of this Form 10-K and see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nManagement uses Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.\n47\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures\nThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of Core operating loss, Core operating margins and Core loss per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of Loss from operations, Operating margins and Diluted loss per share.\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$66,517\n \n$77,794 \n$66,608 \nLoss from operations, as reported\n($10,707)\n($773)\n($3,519)\nOperating margins\n(16.1)\n%\n(1.0)\n%\n(5.3)\n%\nPension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(1)\n($811)\n($799)\n($849)\nPostretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(1)\n(293)\n(257)\n(294)\nFAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(1)\n($1,104)\n($1,056)\n($1,143)\nCore operating loss (non-GAAP)\n($11,811)\n($1,829)\n($4,662)\nCore operating margins (non-GAAP)\n(17.8)\n%\n(2.4)\n%\n(7.0)\n%\nDiluted loss per share, as reported\n($18.36)\n($3.67)\n($8.30)\nPension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(1)\n(1.26)\n(1.32)\n(1.43)\nPostretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(1)\n(0.45)\n(0.42)\n(0.49)\nNon-operating pension income\n(2)\n(0.74)\n(0.87)\n(1.47)\nNon-operating postretirement income\n(2)\n(0.11)\n(0.10)\n(0.10)\nProvision for deferred income taxes on adjustments \n(3)\n0.54\n \n0.57 \n0.73 \nCore loss per share (non-GAAP)\n($20.38)\n($5.81)\n($11.06)\nWeighted average diluted shares (in millions)\n647.2\n \n606.1 \n595.2 \n(1)\nFAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.

Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.\nAccounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total revenue, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total revenue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award fee provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on the estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, supply chain delays and quality issues, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $6,562 million, $2,943 million and $5,253 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were primarily due to losses recognized on the KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, Commercial Crew, VC-25B, and MQ-25 programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. For example, changes in underlying operational assumptions, inability to implement planned risk mitigation plans, failure to achieve productivity targets, supplier shortages, quality issues and/or pricing issues, inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adversely affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2024, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $290 million.\nProgram Accounting\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number \n49\nTable of Contents\nof units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, production rates, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly, as well as customer consideration driven by delivery delays. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include the timing of production rate increases, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, supply chain delays and quality issues, learning curve, change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, regulatory requirements, flight test and certification requirements and schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. Certain production rate increases require regulatory approval. For example, during 2024, the FAA communicated it will not approve production rate increases for the 737 program beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until \nBoeing has complied with required quality and safety standards.\n If we are unable to increase production rates consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted.\nThe introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, certification, and production schedules.\n \nThese challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft. We have experienced significant certification delays with the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification processes for the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10 models and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\nTo ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\nThe 777X and 767 programs recognized earnings charges totaling $3,499 million and $580 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in further earnings charges in future periods. Lower production rates and the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement as well as pay enhancements for certain other non-union employees have also pressured margins on other commercial airplane programs.\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had \n50\nTable of Contents\nbeen estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have an approximately $210 million impact on operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nPension Plans\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. The majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans have transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.\nThe projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rates. The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $1,120 million or increase by $1,240 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on pension cost. However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2024 net periodic pension cost by $143 million. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes the discount rate and expected long-term rate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.\nDeferred Income Taxes – Valuation Allowance\nThe Company had deferred income tax assets of $17,991 million at December 31, 2024, that can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. The Company had deferred income tax liabilities of $10,091 million at December 31, 2024, that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.\nThis assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence. A recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis. Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.\nDeferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years. The Company’s valuation allowance of $7,837 million at December 31, 2024, primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets, tax net operating losses, tax credits and interest carryforwards that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. During 2024, the Company \n51\nTable of Contents\nincreased the valuation allowance by $3,287 million primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in 2024 that cannot be realized in 2024. Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income.\nFor additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.",
