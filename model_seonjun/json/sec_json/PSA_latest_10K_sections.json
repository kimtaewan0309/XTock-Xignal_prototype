We are the industry leading owner of self-storage properties, with the most recognized brand in the self-storage industry, including our ubiquitous orange color.\nOn August 14, 2023, we completed a reorganization that resulted in us holding the interests in our facilities through an operating partnership, Public Storage OP, L.P. and its subsidiaries including Public Storage Operating Company, formerly known as Public Storage, which was organized in 1980. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. After the reorganization, the primary assets of the parent entity, Public Storage, are general partner and limited partner interests in Public Storage OP, L.P.\nUnless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Public Storage” mean the parent entity, Public Storage, references to “PSA OP” mean Public Storage OP, L.P., and references to “PSOC” mean Public Storage Operating Company. References to “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” mean collectively Public Storage, PSA OP, PSOC and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Public Storage, PSA OP, and PSOC.\n1\nSelf-storage Operations\n:\nWe acquire, develop, own, and operate self-storage facilities, which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner of self-storage facilities in the United States (“U.S.”), with physical presence in most major markets and 40 states. We believe our scale, brand name, and technology platform afford us competitive advantages. At December 31, 2024, we held interests in and consolidated 3,073 self-storage facilities (an aggregate of 221 million net rentable square feet of space) operating under the Public Storage® name.\nOther Operations:\nWe manage insurance programs whereby customers at our facilities, including those we manage for third parties, have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their stored goods. A wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of Public Storage fully reinsures these policies and thereby assumes all risk of losses under the policies. This subsidiary receives from the non-affiliated insurance company reinsurance premiums substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants. These policies cover claims for losses related to specified events up to a maximum limit of $5,000 per storage unit. We reinsure all risks in this program but purchase insurance from an independent third-party insurer to cover this exposure for a limit of $15.0 million for losses in excess of $10.0 million per occurrence. At December 31, 2024, there were approximately 1.4 million certificates of insurance held by participating self-storage customers, representing aggregate coverage of approximately $6.8 billion.\nAt December 31, 2024, we managed 307 facilities for third parties (with approximately 23.3 million net rentable square feet), and were under contract to manage 95 additional facilities including 93 facilities that are currently under construction. In addition, we sell merchandise, primarily locks and cardboard boxes, at our self-storage facilities.\nWe implemented a bridge lending program in 2024, under which we provide financing to third-party self-storage owners for operating properties that we manage. We generally originate bridge loans that are collateralized by operating self-storage properties, have a term of three or four years with two one-year extensions, and have variable interest rates. At December 31, 2024, we had a bridge loan receivable balance of $10.0 million and an unfunded loan commitment of $12.5 million, the closing of which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nWe hold a 35% interest in Shurgard Self Storage Limited (“Shurgard”). Shurgard is a public company traded on Euronext Brussels under the “SHUR” symbol. At December 31, 2024, Shurgard owned and operated 318 self-storage facilities (17 million net rentable square feet) located in seven countries in Western Europe under the Shurgard® name.\nFor all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our “REIT taxable income” (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we met these requirements in all periods presented herein and we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nWe file annually with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, which include consolidated financial statements certified by our independent registered public accountants. We also file quarterly with the SEC quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which include unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue such reporting.\nOn our website, www.publicstorage.com, we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, definitive proxy statements, and other reports required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC, as well as all supplements and amendments to those filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after the filings, supplements, and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information contained on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2\nCompetition\nOwnership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 9% of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the four largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 20%, with the remaining 80% owned by regional and local operators. We believe our Public Storage® brand awareness, as well as the innovative improvements we have made to the customer experience described below, provide us with a competitive advantage in acquiring and retaining customers relative to other self-storage operators.\nThe high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility, such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators, who use marketing channels, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners, and offer services similar to ours. As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income, and operating expenses of our facilities. However, we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business allow us to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale.\nTechnology\nWe believe technology enables revenue optimization and cost efficiencies. Over the past few years, we have invested in additional technologies that we believe have enabled us to operate and compete more effectively by providing customers with an enhanced digital experience.\nConvenient shopping experience:\n Customers can conveniently shop for available storage space, reviewing attributes such as facility location, size, amenities (such as climate-control), and pricing through the following marketing channels:\n•\nOur Website:\n The online marketing channel is a key source of customers. Approximately 83% of our move-ins in 2024 were sourced through our website, and we believe that many of our other customers who reserved directly through our customer care center or arrived at a facility and moved in without a reservation reviewed our pricing and availability online through our website. We seek to update the structure, layout, and content of our website regularly to enhance our placement in “unpaid” search in Google and related websites, to improve the efficiency of our bids in “paid” search campaigns, and to maximize users’ likelihood of reserving space on our website.\n•\nOur Customer Care Center:\n Our customer care center is staffed by skilled sales specialists and customer service representatives. Customers can reach our customer care center and complete their rental over the phone by calling our advertised toll-free telephone numbers provided on search engines, from our website, the Public Storage App, or from our in-store kiosks. We believe giving customers the option to interact with a live agent, despite the higher marginal cost relative to a reservation made on our website, enhances our ability to close sales with potential customers and results in greater satisfaction. We also have live Internet chat augmented with ChatBot capability as another channel for our customers to engage our agents, cost effectively improving customer responsiveness.\n•\nOur Properties:\n Customers can also shop for available space at any one of our facilities. Property managers access the same information that is available on our website and to our customer care center agents and can inform the customer of available space at that site or at our other nearby storage facilities. Property managers are trained to maximize the conversion of such “walk in” shoppers into customers. We are expanding the use of in-store kiosks to give customers the options of a full self-service experience or a two-way video assisted service via our existing customer care center.\neRental® move-in process:\n To further enhance the move-in experience, we offer our eRental® process whereby prospective tenants (including those who initially reserved a space) can execute their rental agreement from their smartphone or computer and then go directly to their space on the move-in date. Approximately 70% of customers utilized our eRental® and Rent by Phone process during 2024.\n3\nPublic Storage App:\n We maintain an industry leading customer smartphone application. The Public Storage App provides our customers with digital access to our properties, as well as payment and other account management functions.\nCentralized information network:\n Our centralized reporting and information network enables us to identify changing market conditions and operating trends and analyze customer data. Our network allows us to quickly change each of our individual property’s pricing and promotions, and drive marketing spending, such as the relative level of bidding for various paid search terms on paid search engines.\nGrowth and Investment Strategies\nOur ongoing growth strategies consist of: (i) improving the operating performance of our existing self-storage facilities, (ii) acquiring and developing facilities, and (iii) growing ancillary business activities including tenant reinsurance, third-party management services and a bridge lending program. While our long-term strategy includes each of these elements, in the short term the level of growth in our asset base in any period is dependent upon the cost and availability of capital, as well as the relative attractiveness of available investment alternatives.\nImprove the operating performance of existing facilities:\n We regularly update and enhance our strategies to increase the net cash flow of our existing self-storage facilities through maximizing revenues and controlling operating costs. We maximize revenues through striking the appropriate balance between occupancy and rates for new and existing tenants by regularly adjusting (i) our promotional and other discounts, (ii) the rental rates we charge to new and existing customers, and (iii) our marketing spending and intensity. We adjust these pricing and marketing decisions by observing their impact on web and customer care center traffic, reservations, move-ins, move-outs, tenant length of stay, and other indicators of response. The size and scope of our operations have enabled us to achieve high operating margins and a low level of administrative costs relative to revenues through the centralization of many functions, such as facility maintenance, employee compensation and benefits programs, revenue management, and the development and documentation of standardized operating procedures.\nAcquire existing properties:\n We seek to capitalize on the fragmentation of the self-storage industry through acquiring attractively priced, well-located existing self-storage facilities. We believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the U.S. enhance our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Data on the rental rates and occupancy levels of our existing facilities provide us an advantage in evaluating the potential of acquisition opportunities. Our aggressiveness in bidding for marketed facilities depends upon many factors including the potential for future growth, the quality of construction and location, the cash flow we expect from the facility when operated on our platform, how well the facility fits into our current geographic footprint, and our return on capital expectations.\nDevelop new self-storage facilities and expand existing facilities:\n The development of new self-storage locations and the expansion of existing facilities have been an important source of our growth. Our operating experience in major markets and experience in stabilizing new properties provide us advantages in developing new facilities. We plan to increase our development activity when we identify attractive risk adjusted return profiles with yields above those of acquisitions. However, our level of development is dependent upon many factors, including the cost and availability of land, the cost and availability of construction materials and labor, zoning and permitting limitations, our cost of capital, the cost of acquiring facilities relative to developing new facilities, and local demand and economic conditions.\nGrow ancillary business activities:\n We pursue growth initiatives aimed at increasing our insurance offering coverage for tenants who choose to protect their stored items against loss and desire to maximize their experience. As we grow our self-storage portfolio through acquisition, development and third-party management, we have the opportunity to increase the growth profile of our tenant reinsurance business.\nOur third party management business enables us to generate revenues through management fees, expand our presence, increase our economies of scale, promote our brand, and enhance our ability to acquire additional facilities over the medium and long-term as a result of strategic relationships forged with third-party owners.\nIn 2024 we implemented a bridge lending program, under which we provide financing to third-party self-storage owners for operating properties that we manage. This program not only enables us to earn interest and other fee income but also increases our business in tenant reinsurance and third-party self-storage management and creates opportunities for potential future acquisitions. \n4\nCompliance with Government Regulations\nWe are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including various federal, state, and local regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operation of self-storage facilities. These include various laws and regulations concerning environmental matters, labor matters, and employee safety and health matters. Further, our insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the insurance commission for each state in accordance with certain federal regulations.\nWe are committed to a long-term environmental stewardship program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment and the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns, including environmentally friendly capital initiatives and building and operating properties with high structural resilience and low obsolescence. We accrue environmental assessments and estimated remediation costs when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. Our current practice is to conduct environmental investigations in connection with property acquisitions. Although there can be no assurance, we are not aware of any environmental contamination of any of our facilities that individually or in the aggregate would be material to our overall business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRefer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of certain risks related to government regulations, including risks related to environmental regulations, emergency regulations adopted in response to wildfires, flooding, or public health crises that restrict access to our facilities or the rents we can charge our customers, wage regulations, income tax regulations including relating to REIT qualification, and property tax regulations. \nAside from the regulations discussed therein, we are not aware of any government regulations that have resulted or that we expect will result in compliance costs that had or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.  \nHuman Capital Resources\nOur employees are the cornerstone of our business and fundamental to our ability to execute our corporate strategies and create long-term value for our stakeholders. Our human capital management strategy focuses on attracting, developing, and retaining the highest quality talent.  We achieve these objectives by committing to our employees to provide a diverse and welcoming working environment, regular and transparent communication, competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits, and opportunities for career growth and development. We believe that this approach, together with the core principles of our corporate culture, doing the right thing and upholding integrity in all that we do, promotes employee engagement and a commitment to Public Storage. \nWe have approximately 5,900 employees, including 5,120 customer facing roles (such as property level and customer care center personnel), 340 field management employees, and 440 employees in our corporate operations.\nThe following is an overview of our key programs and initiatives focused on attracting, developing, and retaining the highest quality talent. For detailed information regarding such programs and initiatives, including our sustainability efforts, strategies, commitments, and progress, please refer to our 2024 Sustainability Report, which is available on our website at publicstorage.com. The information contained on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInclusive Culture\nWe are committed to creating a workplace that values people with a wide range of backgrounds, where every employee feels valued and able to be their authentic self as part of our best-in-class team. Public Storage hires based on skills, personality, and experience, without regard to age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristic. We maintain policies regarding equal opportunity, pay-for-performance, discrimination, harassment, and labor (including opposition to child and compulsory labor).\nOur commitments to excellence and hiring “the best” have fostered an inclusive team that reflects the diversity of the customers we serve. We publicly disclose our annual Consolidated EEO-1 report, which reflects the race, ethnicity, and gender composition of our workforce, on the Investor Relations section of our website.\n5\nCommunication and Engagement\nGiven the geographically dispersed nature of our business, maintaining regular and clear communication is essential to ensuring that our employees feel informed, included, valued, and engaged. We use various communication channels, including emails, newsletters, videos, virtual and in-person meetings, and town halls, to provide updates on company strategy, performance, employee recognition, and other information. We also provide opportunities for employees to ask questions of our leadership. \nTo gauge the effectiveness of our engagement strategies, we conduct various surveys to assess employee commitment, motivation, and engagement, and to gather feedback. We use this feedback to refine and enhance our policies and programs for our employees. This includes the creation of additional career advancement opportunities and development programs.\nWe believe that the success of our engagement strategies can also be seen through third party surveys and recognition. Among other recognitions, we are proud again to be named a Great Place to Work® in 2024. We have also been recognized by Comparably, Inc. as a “Choice Employer” with an “A+” Culture Score based on employee responses across 18 culture metrics, among other recognitions.\nCompensation, Health, Wellness, and Safety\nPublic Storage maintains compensation and benefits programs designed to incentivize, reward, and support our employees. We believe that employee compensation should align with our short- and long-term performance goals and provide competitive compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate, and retain employees who are crucial to our success. We tailor our compensation programs to each employee group to ensure market competitiveness and enhance overall employee engagement.\nWe offer affordable health plans and programs to virtually all our employees. Our full-time employees are eligible to participate in our comprehensive range of benefits, which include medical, dental, vision, flexible and health savings accounts, discount programs, income protection plans, and our 401(k) plan. Additionally, we maintain various employee support programs, including access to counseling, life planning tools, and discount programs for fitness, legal services, and home, auto, and pet insurance. Finally, we offer educational resources and tools, including a dedicated health and wellness website, to encourage employees to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. We periodically consider employee feedback received through our engagement processes in the composition and design of our compensation and benefits programs.\nWe are committed to providing safe self-storage facilities for our customers and employees.  We conduct monthly safety training at all our properties and an annual safety training at our headquarters.  We publicly disclose our employee health and safety data in our annual Sustainability Report.\nTraining and Development\nAt Public Storage, we offer comprehensive training and development programs at every level of the organization. These programs are intended to provide our employees with the skills, tools, and knowledge they need to be successful in their roles and to contribute to the organization’s success. They are also intended to foster individual growth and strong employee engagement.\nMost of our new hires join Public Storage as property managers without prior experience in the self-storage industry. We provide a hands-on new employee training program that includes coaching and development. For those new hires in leadership roles, we provide property-level training that exposes them to daily property operations and is intended to help them understand the fundamentals of our business and operations. We also offer numerous career development opportunities for existing employees, including management training programs. This includes a path for our property level employees to move into management and leadership roles and advance their careers within the Company. Many of our training and career development programs use our online learning platform of training courses and reference materials. In addition to formal training programs, we also offer one-on-one coaching, job shadowing, and mentoring opportunities.\n6\nPerformance Management and Succession Planning\nOur performance management processes are designed to encourage collaboration between employees and their managers. Together, employees and managers work to plan, monitor, and review the employee’s objectives and career aspirations, establishing and holding employees accountable to both short- and long-term goals that align with the Company’s strategy. This is a continuous process intended to provide regular opportunities for employees and their managers to share and receive feedback.\nSuccession planning is a priority for management and our Board and is viewed as critical to ensuring business continuity and supporting the Company’s long-term growth and success. Periodically throughout each year, the executive team meets to review and assess the Company’s succession bench strength, evaluate talent, and make recommendations for developing and preparing future leaders within the organization. This collaborative approach to talent management works to ensure that employees are given opportunities to grow beyond their current roles and responsibilities.\nClimate Change and Environmental Stewardship\nWe are committed to managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Our goal is to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that aligns with our long-term corporate strategy and promotes our best interests along with those of our stakeholders, including our customers, investors, employees, and the communities in which we do business.\nOur management Environmental, Social, and Governance Steering Committee (our “Sustainability Committee”) guides our commitment to sustainability and has primary responsibility for climate-related activities. The Sustainability Committee reports to our Board and its committees, which oversee all of our sustainability initiatives.\nWe consider potential environmental impacts—both positive and negative—in our decision making across the business.\nWe measure and monitor our environmental impact and leverage sustainability measures to reduce this impact while achieving cost efficiencies in our operations by implementing a range of energy, water, and waste management initiatives. Many of these initiatives are integrated into our ongoing Property of Tomorrow capital investment program.\nRegarding climate, we assess risks and opportunities in conjunction with ongoing operating and risk management processes across the company. We give primary consideration to physical, regulatory, legal, market, and reputational risks. Examples of these risks include heat/water stress, natural disasters, pandemics, temperature change, and regulatory compliance. We are addressing potential heat stress risks (e.g., higher energy costs, more frequent power outages, and impacts on our customers and workforce) through initiatives such as converting to LED lighting, efficient HVAC, and solar power generation installation. We are addressing potential water stress risks (e.g., increased costs and decreased availability) through initiatives such as efficient plumbing systems, low-water use irrigation systems, drought tolerant and native landscaping, water run-off controls, and storm water retention. We address the remaining risks primarily through natural disaster resilient development, redevelopment, and capital expenditures.\nWe have established a combined scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas reduction goal. Our target is to achieve a 45% reduction in utility-based emissions, calculated on an intensity basis, no later than 2032, based on a 2022 baseline. \nWe will continue to utilize our unique competitive advantages in furthering our environmental stewardship efforts and addressing the effects of climate change. Please refer to our Sustainability Report for further information.\nSeasonality\nWe experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the demand for self-storage space, with demand and rental rates generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months. We believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer months.\n7",
  "item7": "ITEM 7.    \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nWe believe the following are our critical accounting estimates, because they are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that involve a significant level of uncertainty.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\n The analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets, including our real estate facilities, involves identification of indicators of impairment, including unfavorable operational results and significant cost overruns on construction, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. In particular, these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions, such as the projections of future rental rates, stabilized occupancy level, future profit margin, discount rates, and capitalization rates, all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions. Others could come to materially different conclusions.\n23\nAllocating Purchase Price for Acquired Real Estate Facilities\n: We estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities of acquired real estate facilities, which consist principally of land, buildings and acquired customers in place, for purposes of allocating the aggregate purchase price of acquired real estate facilities. We estimate the fair value of land based upon price per square foot derived from observable transactions involving comparable land in similar locations as adjusted for location quality, parcel size, and date of sale associated with the acquired facilities. The fair value estimate of land is sensitive to the adjustments made to the land market transactions used in the estimate, particularly when there is a lack of recent comparable land market data. We estimate the fair value of buildings primarily using the income approach by estimating the fair value of hypothetical vacant acquired facilities and adjusting for the estimated fair value of land. The fair value estimate of buildings is sensitive to assumptions, such as lease-up period, future stabilized operating cash flows, capitalization rate and discount rate. We estimate the fair value of acquired customers in place using the income approach by estimating the foregone rent over the presumed period of time to absorb the occupied spaces as if they were vacant at the time of acquisition. The fair value estimate of  the acquired customers in place is sensitive to the assumptions used in the income approach, such as market rent, lease-up period and discount rate. Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values of land, buildings and acquired customers in place, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, as well as the level of land and buildings on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOverview \nOur self-storage operations generate most of our net income, and our earnings growth is impacted by the levels of organic growth within our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) as well as within our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities (both as defined below).\nDuring 2024, revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities decreased by 0.7% ($26.7 million), as compared to 2023, while Same Store cost of operations increased by 2.4% ($20.6 million). Softness in demand for our storage space has led to lower move-in rental rates for new tenants and lower average occupancy in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nWe have grown and plan to continue to grow through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expansion of our existing self-storage facilities. Since the beginning of 2022, we acquired a total of 260 facilities with 18.5 million net rentable square feet for $3.7 billion.  Additionally, within our non-same store portfolio, our Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities (as defined below) include a total of 132 self-storage facilities with 15.8 million net rentable square feet. For development and expansions completed by December 31, 2024, we incurred a total cost of $1.6 billion. During 2024, combined net operating income generated by our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities increased 48.1% ($101.0 million), as compared to 2023.\nWe have experienced recent inflationary impacts on our cost of operations including labor, utilities, and repairs and maintenance, and costs of development and expansion activities, and we expect to experience such impacts in the future. We have implemented various initiatives to manage the adverse impacts, such as enhancements in operational processes and investments in technology to reduce payroll hours, achievement of economies of scale from recent acquisitions with supervisory payroll and centralized management costs allocated over a broader number of self-storage facilities, and investments in solar power and LED lights to lower utility usage.\nIn order to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors (including newly developed facilities), we embarked on our multi-year Property of Tomorrow program to (i) rebrand our properties with more pronounced, attractive, and clearly identifiable color schemes and signage and (ii) upgrade the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. We completed the program in 2024. We spent approximately $127 million on the program in 2024. We have also embarked on a solar program under which we plan to install solar panels on over 1,400 of our self-storage facilities. We have completed the installations on 772 facilities through December 31, 2024. We spent approximately $54 million on the program in 2024 and expect to spend approximately $50 million in 2025 on this effort.\nDuring 2024, PSOC completed a public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in various tranches and maturities and issued €150 million of senior notes to institutional investors. PSOC also repaid at maturity $700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes and €100 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes.\n24\nDuring 2024, we repurchased 726,865 of our common shares under our previously announced share repurchase program on the open market for a total cost of $200.0 million, driven by our expected improvement in operating fundamentals and growth.\nDuring 2024, we sold 184,390 of our common shares on the open market through our “at the market” offering program for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $60.3 million in cash.\nIn early 2025, multiple wildfires erupted in southern California and caused significant destruction of business and residential structures. We did not incur any direct property damage in the affected areas. In response to the devastation, a “State of Emergency” has been declared for Los Angeles County and Ventura County, under which a temporary governmental pricing limitation is in place for our self-storage facilities located in these counties. These self-storage facilities generated approximately 10% of revenues earned by our Same Store Facilities in 2024. We anticipate a potentially significant negative impact on the revenue growth from these self-storage facilities, the extent of which depends largely on the duration of the State of Emergency order and other future actions by government authorities, among other factors.\n25\nResults of Operations \nOperating Results for 2024 and 2023\nIn 2024, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1.873 billion or $10.64 per diluted common share, compared to $1.949 billion or $11.06 per diluted common share in 2023, representing a decrease of $76.1 million or $0.42 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $159.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) an $86.3 million increase in interest expense, (iii) a $26.0 million increase in general and administrative expense, (iv) an $18.4 million decrease in interest and other income, partially offset by (v) a $153.4 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (vi) a $61.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income.\nThe $61.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income in 2024 as compared to 2023 is a result of a $108.9 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below), partially offset by a $47.3 million decrease attributable to our Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities decreased 0.7% or $26.7 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to a decline in occupancy and lower realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 2.4% or $20.6 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to increased property tax expense, marketing expense, and repairs and maintenance expense, partially offset by decreased centralized management costs and on-site property manager payroll expense. The increase in net operating income of $108.9 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2023.\nOperating Results for 2023 and 2022\nIn 2023, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1.949 billion or $11.06 per diluted common share, compared to $4.142 billion or $23.50 per diluted common share in 2022, representing a decrease of $2.2 billion or $12.44 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”) in July 2022, (ii) a $149.5 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable, (iii) a $79.1 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to our sale of PSB in July 2022, and (iv) a $64.8 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by (v) a $231.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (vi) a $45.0 million increase in interest and other income.\nThe $231.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income in 2023 as compared to 2022 is a result of a $131.8 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $100.0 million increase in our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 4.8% or $170.2 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 4.6% or $38.4 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, due primarily to increased property tax expense, marketing expense and other direct property costs. The increase in net operating income of $100.0 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2022 and 2023.\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted common share (“FFO per share”) are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before real estate-related depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, FFO was $17.19 per diluted common share as compared to $16.60 and $16.46 per diluted common share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase in 2024 of 3.6%, or $0.59 per diluted common share, as compared to 2023.\n26\nWe also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of loss contingencies and resolutions, casualties, due diligence costs incurred in pursuit of strategic transactions, unrealized gain on private equity investments, reorganization costs, acquisition integration costs, amortization of acquired non real estate-related intangibles, a cash and stock hiring bonus for a new senior executive, and our equity share of tax effect of a change in tax status, unrealized gain on derivatives, merger transaction costs and senior executive severance from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such measures, Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.\n27\nThe following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nPercentage Change\n2023\n2022\nPercentage Change\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nReconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO:\nNet income allocable to common shareholders\n$\n1,872,685 \n$\n1,948,741 \n(3.9)\n%\n$\n1,948,741 \n$\n4,142,288 \n(53.0)\n%\nEliminate items excluded from FFO:\nReal estate-related depreciation and amortization\n1,117,752 \n962,703 \n962,703 \n881,569 \nReal estate-related depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investment\n44,181 \n36,769 \n36,769 \n54,822 \nReal estate-related depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders and unvested LTIP unitholders\n(7,167)\n(6,635)\n(6,635)\n(6,622)\nGains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investment\n(1,537)\n(17,290)\n(17,290)\n(54,403)\nGain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc.\n— \n— \n— \n(2,116,839)\nFFO allocable to common shares\n$\n3,025,914 \n$\n2,924,288 \n3.5 \n%\n$\n2,924,288 \n$\n2,900,815 \n0.8 \n%\nEliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investment:\nForeign currency exchange (gain) loss\n(102,244)\n51,197 \n51,197 \n(98,314)\nUnrealized gain on private equity investments\n(4,355)\n(2,817)\n(2,817)\n(4,685)\nHiring bonus for a new senior executive\n3,507 \n— \n— \n— \nOther items\n12,246 \n3,264 \n3,264 \n9,164 \nCore FFO allocable to common shares\n$\n2,935,068 \n$\n2,975,932 \n(1.4)\n%\n$\n2,975,932 \n$\n2,806,980 \n6.0 \n%\nReconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share to FFO per Share and Core FFO per Share:\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n10.64 \n$\n11.06 \n(3.8)\n%\n$\n11.06 \n$\n23.50 \n(52.9)\n%\nEliminate amounts per share excluded from FFO:\nReal estate-related depreciation and amortization\n6.56 \n5.64 \n5.64 \n5.27 \nGains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investment\n(0.01)\n(0.10)\n(0.10)\n(0.31)\nGain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc.\n— \n— \n— \n(12.00)\nFFO per share \n$\n17.19 \n$\n16.60 \n3.6 \n%\n$\n16.60 \n$\n16.46 \n0.9 \n%\nEliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investment:\nForeign currency exchange (gain) loss\n(0.58)\n0.29 \n0.29 \n(0.57)\nUnrealized gain on private equity investments\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\n(0.03)\nHiring bonus for a new senior executive\n0.02 \n— \n— \n— \nOther items\n0.06 \n0.02 \n0.02 \n0.06 \nCore FFO per share \n$\n16.67 \n$\n16.89 \n(1.3)\n%\n$\n16.89 \n$\n15.92 \n6.1 \n%\nDiluted weighted average common shares\n176,038 \n176,143 \n176,143 \n176,280 \n28\nAnalysis of Net Income — Self-Storage Operations\nOur self-storage operations are analyzed in four groups: (i) the 2,507 facilities that we have owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2022 (the “Same Store Facilities”), (ii) 260 facilities we acquired since January 1, 2022 (the “Acquired Facilities”), (iii) 132 facilities that have been newly developed or expanded, or that had commenced expansion by December 31, 2024 (the “Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities”), and (iv) 174 other facilities, which are otherwise not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since January 1, 2022 (the “Other Non-Same Store Facilities”).

We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and evaluating property operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income, operating cash flow, or other related financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. See Note 13 to our December 31, 2024 consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our total net income for all periods presented.\nSame Store Facilities\nThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities we have owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2022. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us more effectively to evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2022, 2023, and 2024 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe investors and analysts use Same Store Facilities information in a similar manner. However, because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. \nThe following table summarizes the historical operating results (for all periods presented) of these 2,507 facilities (170.0 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 77% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2024. It includes various measures and detail that we do not include in the analysis of the developed, acquired, and other non-same store facilities, due to the relative magnitude and importance of the Same Store Facilities relative to our other self-storage facilities.\n31\nSelected Operating Data for the Same Store Facilities (2,507 facilities)\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange (e)\n2023\n2022\nChange (e)\n \n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per square foot data)\nRevenues (a):\nRental income \n$\n3,550,125 \n$\n3,577,609 \n(0.8)%\n$\n3,577,609 \n$\n3,419,212 \n4.6%\nLate charges and administrative fees\n126,507 \n125,722 \n0.6%\n125,722 \n113,937 \n10.3%\nTotal revenues\n3,676,632 \n3,703,331 \n(0.7)%\n3,703,331 \n3,533,149 \n4.8%\nDirect cost of operations (a):\nProperty taxes\n347,511 \n331,982 \n4.7%\n331,982 \n320,795 \n3.5%\nOn-site property manager payroll\n132,493 \n137,162 \n(3.4)%\n137,162 \n133,248 \n2.9%\nRepairs and maintenance \n75,354 \n69,151 \n9.0%\n69,151 \n65,071 \n6.3%\nUtilities \n47,643 \n49,580 \n(3.9)%\n49,580 \n50,606 \n(2.0)%\nMarketing\n84,936 \n75,080 \n13.1%\n75,080 \n52,540 \n42.9%\nOther direct property costs\n101,104 \n98,054 \n3.1%\n98,054 \n90,081 \n8.9%\nTotal direct cost of operations\n789,041 \n761,009 \n3.7%\n761,009 \n712,341 \n6.8%\nDirect net operating income (b)\n2,887,591 \n2,942,322 \n(1.9)%\n2,942,322 \n2,820,808 \n4.3%\nIndirect cost of operations (a):\nSupervisory payroll\n(40,568)\n(41,444)\n(2.1)%\n(41,444)\n(44,091)\n(6.0)%\nCentralized management costs\n(55,834)\n(60,659)\n(8.0)%\n(60,659)\n(64,046)\n(5.3)%\nShare-based compensation\n(9,840)\n(11,603)\n(15.2)%\n(11,603)\n(15,819)\n(26.7)%\nNet operating income\n2,781,349 \n2,828,616 \n(1.7)%\n2,828,616 \n2,696,852 \n4.9%\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n(682,783)\n(658,334)\n3.7%\n(658,334)\n(654,238)\n0.6%\nNet income\n$\n2,098,566 \n$\n2,170,282 \n(3.3)%\n$\n2,170,282 \n$\n2,042,614 \n6.3%\nGross margin (before indirect costs, depreciation and amortization expense)\n78.5%\n79.5%\n(1.0)%\n79.5%\n79.8%\n(0.3)%\nGross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense)\n75.6%\n76.4%\n(0.8)%\n76.4%\n76.3%\n0.1%\nWeighted average for the period:\nSquare foot occupancy \n92.4%\n93.0%\n(0.6)%\n93.0%\n94.6%\n(1.6)%\nRealized annual rental income per (c):\nOccupied square foot\n$\n22.61\n$\n22.64\n(0.1)%\n$\n22.64\n$\n21.28\n6.4%\nAvailable square foot\n$\n20.89\n$\n21.05\n(0.8)%\n$\n21.05\n$\n20.12\n4.6%\nAt December 31:\nSquare foot occupancy\n90.5%\n91.3%\n(0.8)%\n91.3%\n92.0%\n(0.7)%\nAnnual contract rent per occupied square foot (d)\n$\n22.89\n$\n22.80\n0.4%\n$\n22.80\n$\n22.61\n0.8%\n32\n(a)\nRevenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities. See “Ancillary Operations” below for more information.\n(b)\nDirect net operating income (“Direct NOI”), a subtotal within NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll, centralized management costs, and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. \n(c)\nRealized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income. \n(d)\nAnnual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.\n(e)\nRepresents the absolute nominal change with respect to gross margin and square foot occupancy, and the percentage change with respect to all other items.\nAnalysis of Same Store Revenue\nWe believe a balanced occupancy and rate strategy maximizes our revenues over time. We regularly adjust rental rates and promotional discounts offered (generally, “$1.00 rent for the first month”), as well as our marketing efforts to maximize revenue from new tenants to replace tenants that vacate. \nWe typically increase rental rates to our long-term tenants (generally, those who have been with us for at least six months) every six to twelve months. As a result, the number of long-term tenants we have in our facilities is an important factor in our revenue growth. The level of rate increases to long-term tenants is based upon evaluating the additional revenue from the increase against the negative impact of incremental move-outs, by considering customers’ in-place rent and prevailing market rents, among other factors. \nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2024 to the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nRevenues generated by our Same Store Facilities decreased 0.7% in 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to a 0.6% decrease in average occupancy and a 0.1% decrease in realized annual rent per occupied square foot.\nThe decrease in realized annual rent per occupied square foot in 2024 as compared to 2023 was due to a 11.6% decrease in average rates per square foot charged to new tenants moving in over the past twelve months, partially offset by cumulative rate increases to existing long-term tenants over the same period. At December 31, 2024, annual contract rent per occupied square foot was 0.4% higher as compared to December 31, 2023.\nThe weighted average square foot occupancy for our Same Store Facilities was 92.4% for 2024, representing a decrease of 0.6%, as compared to 2023. Occupancy levels have gradually declined since the second half of 2022 as customer demand softened. In response, we lowered move-in rental rates and increased advertising spending to stimulate move-in activity at our facilities in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nMove-out activities from our tenants were lower in 2024 as compared to 2023. More than half of our tenants have rented their space for longer than six months at December 31, 2024, which supported our revenue growth from existing long-term tenants.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2023 to the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased 4.8% in 2023 as compared to 2022, due primarily to a 6.4% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in average occupancy.\n33\nThe increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot in 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to cumulative rate increases to existing long-term tenants over the past twelve months, partially offset by a 13.9% decrease in average rates per square foot charged to new tenants moving in who replaced tenants moving out with higher rental rates. At December 31, 2023, annual contract rent per occupied square foot was 0.8% higher as compared to December 31, 2022.\nThe weighted average square foot occupancy for our Same Store Facilities was 93.0% for 2023, representing a decrease of 1.6%, as compared to 2022. Occupancy levels have gradually declined since the second half of 2022. In response we lowered move-in rental rates and increased promotional activity and advertising spending to increase move-in activity at our facilities in 2023 as compared to 2022.\nMove-out activities from our tenants were higher in 2023 as compared to 2022. Average length of stay of our tenants remained at similar high levels in 2023 as compared to 2022, which supported our revenue growth from existing long-term tenants.\nSelected Key Move-in and Move-Out Statistical Data\nThe following table sets forth average annual contract rent per square foot and total square footage for tenants moving in and moving out during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Contract rents gained from move-ins and contracts rents lost from move-outs included in the table assume move-in and move-out activities occur at the beginning of each period presented. The table also includes promotional discounts, which vary based upon the move-in contractual rates, move-in volume, and percentage of tenants moving in who receive the discount. \nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\n(Amounts in thousands, except for per square foot amounts)\nTenants moving in during the period:\nAverage annual contract rent per square foot\n$\n13.76 \n$\n15.57 \n(11.6)%\n$\n15.57 \n$\n18.08 \n(13.9)%\nSquare footage \n120,176 \n121,432 \n(1.0)%\n121,432 \n112,410 \n8.0%\nContract rents gained from move-ins\n$\n1,653,622 \n$\n1,890,696 \n(12.5)%\n$\n1,890,696 \n$\n2,032,373 \n(7.0)%\nPromotional discounts given\n$\n61,736 \n$\n66,031 \n(6.5)%\n$\n66,031 \n$\n60,839 \n8.5%\nTenants moving out during the period:\nAverage annual contract rent per square foot\n$\n20.70 \n$\n21.20 \n(2.4)%\n$\n21.20 \n$\n20.53 \n3.3%\nSquare footage \n121,425 \n122,489 \n(0.9)%\n122,489 \n116,404 \n5.2%\nContract rents lost from move-outs\n$\n2,513,498 \n$\n2,596,767 \n(3.2)%\n$\n2,596,767 \n$\n2,389,774 \n8.7%\nIndustry-wide demand was weaker in 2024 compared to 2023 partially due to lower home-moving activities offset by increases in customers who sought storage space for other reasons. Demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy, as well as new supply of self-storage space and alternatives to self-storage. \nWe expect industry-wide demand from new customers in 2025 to be similar to 2024. However, following the recent wildfires in southern California in early 2025, we anticipate a potentially significant negative impact on the revenue growth from the self-storage facilities located in Los Angeles County and Ventura County, where a temporary governmental pricing limitation is in place under the “State of Emergency” declarations. These self-storage facilities generated approximately 10% of revenues earned by our Same Store Facilities in 2024. As a result, we expect Same Store Facilities revenues in 2025 to be similar to those earned in 2024. \nLate Charges and Administrative Fees\nLate charges and administrative fees increased 0.6% and 10.3% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year. The increase in 2024 was due primarily to higher late charges and lien fees collected on delinquent accounts. The increase in 2023 was due to higher late charges collected on delinquent accounts and higher administrative fees resulting from higher move-in volumes. Delinquency rates remained at similar levels for 2024 as compared to 2023.\n34\nAnalysis of Same Store Cost of Operations \nCost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased 2.4% and 4.6% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year. The increase in 2024 was due primarily to increased property tax expense, marketing expense, and repairs and maintenance expense, partially offset by decreased centralized management costs and on-site property manager payroll expense. The increase in 2023 was due primarily to increased property tax expense, marketing expense, and other direct property costs.\nProperty tax expense increased 4.7% and 3.5% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year, as a result of higher assessed values. We expect property tax expense to grow approximately 5% in 2025 due primarily to higher assessed values.\nOn-site property manager payroll expense decreased 3.4% in 2024 as compared to 2023 and increased 2.9% in 2023 as compared to 2022. The decrease in 2024 was primarily due to reduction in labor hours driven by the implementation of dynamic staffing models based on customer activity levels. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to increases in wage rates as a result of competitive labor conditions experienced in most geographical markets. We expect on-site property manager payroll expense to decrease moderately in 2025 as compared to 2024 as we continue to enhance operational processes.\nRepairs and maintenance expense increased 9.0% and 6.3% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year. Repairs and maintenance expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as (i) damage and equipment malfunctions, (ii) short-term local supply and demand factors for material and labor, and (iii) weather conditions, which can impact costs such as snow removal, roof repairs, and HVAC maintenance and repairs.\nOur utility expense consists primarily of electricity costs, which are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature. Utility expense decreased 3.9% and 2.0% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year, due primarily to our investment in energy saving technology such as solar power and LED lights, which generate favorable returns on investment in the form of lower utility usage. We expect a decline in utility expense in 2025 as compared to 2024 as we continue our investment in solar power.\nMarketing expense includes Internet advertising we utilize through our online paid search programs, television advertising and the operating costs of our website and telephone reservation center. Internet advertising expense, comprising keyword search fees assessed on a “per click” basis, varies based upon demand for self-storage space, the quantity of people inquiring about self-storage through online search, occupancy levels, the number and aggressiveness of bidding competitors, and other factors. These factors are volatile; accordingly, Internet advertising can increase or decrease significantly in the short-term. We increased marketing expense by 13.1% and 42.9% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year, primarily by utilizing a higher volume of online paid search programs to attract new tenants. We plan to continue to use internet advertising and other advertising channels to support move-in volumes in 2025.\nOther direct property costs include administrative expenses specific to each self-storage facility, such as property loss, telephone and data communication lines, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the facilities’ cash receipts, tenant mailings, credit card fees, eviction costs, and the cost of operating each property’s rental office. These costs increased 3.1% in 2024 as compared to 2023 and 8.9% in 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to increased property loss and restoration expenses related to fire and flooding events. The increase in 2023 was due primarily to an increase in credit card fees as a result of year-over-year increases in revenues, combined with a long-term trend of more customers paying with credit cards rather than cash, checks, or other methods of payment with lower transaction costs.\nCentralized management costs represent administrative and cash compensation expenses for shared general corporate functions to the extent their efforts are devoted to self-storage operations. Such functions include information technology support, hardware, and software, as well as centralized administration of payroll, benefits, training, repairs and maintenance, customer service, pricing and marketing, operational accounting and finance, legal costs, and costs from field management executives. Centralized management costs decreased 8.0% in 2024 as compared to 2023 and decreased 5.3% in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily driven by achievement of economies of scale from recent acquisitions with centralized management costs allocated over a broader number of self-storage facilities including non-same store facilities.\n35\nAnalysis of Market Trends\nThe following tables set forth selected market trends in our Same Store Facilities:\nSame Store Facilities Operating Trends by Market\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31,\n \nNumber\nof \nFacilities\nSquare\nFeet\n(millions)\nRealized Rent per\nOccupied Square Foot\nAverage Occupancy\nRealized Rent per\nAvailable Square Foot\n \n2024\n2023\nChange (a)\n2024\n2023\nChange (a)\n2024\n2023\nChange (a)\nLos Angeles                   \n218\n15.9\n$\n36.09 \n$\n35.83 \n0.7 \n%\n94.6 \n%\n95.4 \n%\n(0.8)\n%\n$\n34.15 \n$\n34.16 \n— \n%\nSan Francisco                 \n130\n8.1\n32.69 \n32.22 \n1.5 \n%\n94.3 \n%\n94.3 \n%\n— \n%\n30.81 \n30.38 \n1.4 \n%\nNew York                      \n91\n6.7\n32.26 \n32.07 \n0.6 \n%\n93.6 \n%\n93.3 \n%\n0.3 \n%\n30.19 \n29.93 \n0.9 \n%\nWashington DC                 \n109\n7.3\n26.92 \n26.62 \n1.1 \n%\n92.8 \n%\n91.7 \n%\n1.1 \n%\n24.97 \n24.40 \n2.3 \n%\nMiami                         \n87\n6.3\n29.93 \n30.01 \n(0.3)\n%\n93.1 \n%\n93.6 \n%\n(0.5)\n%\n27.88 \n28.08 \n(0.7)\n%\nDallas-Ft.

See “Ancillary Operations” below for more information.\n(c)\nThe amount includes the costs allocated to land, buildings and intangible assets associated with the 127 self-storage facilities from the Simply Acquisition.\nWe have been active in acquiring facilities in recent years. Since the beginning of 2022, we acquired a total of 260 facilities with 18.5 million net rentable square feet for $3.7 billion. During 2024, these facilities contributed net operating income of $159.7 million.\nDuring 2023, we acquired BREIT Simply Storage LLC (“Simply”), a self-storage company that owned and operated 127 self-storage facilities (9.4 million square feet) and managed 25 self-storage facilities (1.8 million square feet) for third parties, for a purchase price of $2.2 billion in cash. Included in the acquisition results in the table above are the Simply portfolio self-storage revenues of $151.8 million, NOI of $103.9 million (including Direct NOI of $109.2 million), and average square footage occupancy of 87.7% for 2024.\nWe remain active in seeking to acquire additional self-storage facilities. Future acquisition volume is likely to be impacted by cost of capital and overall macro-economic uncertainties. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, we acquired or were under contract to acquire nine self-storage facilities across six states with 0.7 million net rentable square feet for $140.7 million.\n41\nNewly Developed and Expanded Facilities\nThe Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities include 46 facilities that were developed on new sites since January 1, 2019, and 86 facilities expanded to increase their net rentable square footage. Of these expansions, 64 were completed before 2023, 17 were completed in 2023 or 2024, and five are currently in process at December 31, 2024.

See “Ancillary Operations” below for more information.\n(c)\nThese amounts only include the direct cost incurred to expand and renovate these facilities, and do not include (i) the original cost to develop or acquire the facility or (ii) the lost revenue on space demolished during the construction and fill-up period. \n(d)\nWe have completed an expansion project on a facility developed in 2021 for $12.8 million, adding 79,000 net rentable square feet of storage space as of December 31, 2024.\nOur Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities includes a total of 132 self-storage facilities of 15.8 million net rentable square feet. For development and expansions completed by December 31, 2024, we incurred a total cost of $1.6 billion. During 2024, Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities contributed net operating income of $151.4 million.\nIt typically takes at least three to four years for a newly developed or expanded self-storage facility to stabilize with respect to revenues. Physical occupancy can be achieved as early as two to three years following completion of the development or expansion through offering lower rental rates during fill-up. As a result, even after achieving high occupancy, there can still be a period of elevated revenue growth as the tenant base matures and higher rental rates are achieved. \nWe believe that our development and redevelopment activities generate favorable risk-adjusted returns over the long run. However, in the short run, our earnings are diluted during the construction and stabilization period due to the cost of capital to fund the development cost, the related construction and development overhead expenses included in general and administrative expense, and the net operating loss from newly developed facilities undergoing fill-up. \nWe typically underwrite new developments to stabilize at approximately an 8.0% NOI yield on cost (adjusted for impacts from tenant reinsurance and maintenance capital expenditures). Our developed facilities have thus far leased up as expected and are at various stages of their revenue stabilization periods. The actual annualized yields that we may achieve on these facilities upon stabilization will depend on many factors, including local and current market conditions in the vicinity of each property and the level of new and existing supply.\nThe facilities under “expansions completed” represent those facilities where the expansions have been completed at December 31, 2024. We incurred a total of $895.7 million in direct cost to expand these facilities, demolished a total of 1.1 million net rentable square feet of storage space, and built a total of 6.8 million net rentable square feet of new storage space. \nAt December 31, 2024, we had 26 additional facilities in development, which will have a total of 2.5 million net rentable square feet of storage space and have an aggregate development cost totaling approximately $498.9 million. We expect these facilities to open over the next 18 to 24 months. \n44\nThe facilities under “expansion in process” represent those facilities where construction is in process at December 31, 2024, and together with additional future expansion activities primarily related to our Same Store Facilities at December 31, 2024, we expect to add a total of 1.5 million net rentable square feet of storage space by expanding existing self-storage facilities for an aggregate direct development cost of $242.7 million.\nOther Non-Same Store Facilities\nThe “Other Non-Same Store Facilities” represent facilities which, while not newly acquired, developed, or expanded, are not fully stabilized since January 1, 2022, including facilities undergoing fill-up as well as facilities damaged in casualty events such as hurricanes, floods, and fires. \nThe Other Non-Same Store Facilities have an aggregate of 17.0 million net rentable square feet at December 31, 2024. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, the average occupancy for these facilities totaled 82.5%, 81.4%, and 81.2%, respectively, and the realized rent per occupied square foot totaled $17.17, $16.64, and $14.85, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense for Self-Storage Operations increased $159.7 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 and increased $81.9 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to newly acquired facilities of $2.7 billion in 2023 and newly developed and expanded facilities.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the components of net income, including Ancillary Operations and certain items not allocated to segments, present a comparison for the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of these components for the years ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 on page 23, under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which was filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024.\nAncillary Operations\nAncillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities, sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities, and management of property owned by unrelated third parties. The following table sets forth our ancillary operations:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\n \n(Amounts in thousands)\nRevenues:\nTenant reinsurance premiums \n$\n226,595\n$\n203,503\n$\n23,092\nMerchandise \n26,970\n27,511\n(541)\nThird party property management\n46,058\n27,063\n18,995\nTotal revenues \n299,623\n258,077\n41,546\nCost of operations:\nTenant reinsurance \n56,678\n42,366\n14,312\nMerchandise \n17,633\n17,137\n496\nThird party property management\n46,970\n26,493\n20,477\nTotal cost of operations \n121,281\n85,996\n35,285\nNet operating income (loss):\nTenant reinsurance \n169,917\n161,137\n8,780\nMerchandise \n9,337\n10,374\n(1,037)\nThird party property management\n(912)\n570\n(1,482)\nTotal net operating income\n$\n178,342\n$\n172,081\n$\n6,261\n \n45\nTenant reinsurance operations: \nTenant reinsurance premium revenue increased $23.1 million or 11.3% in 2024 over 2023, as a result of an increase in our tenant base with respect to acquired, newly developed, and expanded facilities and the third party properties we manage, as well as higher insurance participation in our tenant base at our same store facilities. Tenant reinsurance premium revenue generated from tenants at our Same-Store Facilities were $170.0 million and $163.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a 4.2% year over year increase in 2024.\nCost of operations primarily includes claims paid as well as claims adjustment expenses. Claims expenses vary based upon the number of insured tenants and the volume of events that drive covered customer losses, such as burglary, as well as catastrophic weather events affecting multiple properties such as hurricanes and floods. Tenant reinsurance cost of operations increased $14.3 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to increased claim volumes and expenses related to flooding, burglary and hurricane events as well as increased access fees we paid to the third-party owners of properties we manage driven by the significant growth of our third-party property management program.\nWe expect tenant reinsurance operation to grow as we roll out insurance policies with increased coverage and higher premiums in 2025, and as we continue to increase the tenant base at our newly acquired and developed facilities.\nThird-party property management: \nAt December 31, 2024, in our third-party property management program, we managed 307 facilities (23.3 million net rentable square feet) for unrelated third parties, and were under contract to manage 95 additional facilities (8.4 million net rentable square feet) including 93 facilities that are currently under construction. During 2024, we added 133 facilities to the program, acquired three facilities from the program, and had 52 facilities exit the program. While we expect this business to increase in scope and size, we do not expect any significant changes in overall profitability of this business in the near term as we seek new properties to manage and are in the earlier stages of fill-up for newly managed properties.\nAnalysis of items not allocated to segments\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entity\nWe account for our equity investment in Shurgard using the equity method and record our pro-rata share of its net income. We recognized equity in earnings of Shurgard of $19.8 million and $27.9 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in our equity earnings from Shurgard were $44.2 million and $36.8 million of our share of depreciation and amortization expense for 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOn August 1, 2024, Shurgard acquired Lok’nStore, a self-storage company publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, for approximately £385 million ($501 million) in cash, including direct acquisition costs.\nFor purposes of recording our equity in earnings from Shurgard, the Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.039 U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2024 (1.104 at December 31, 2023), and average exchange rates of 1.082 for 2024 and 1.081 for 2023.\nReal estate acquisition and development expense:\n In 2024 and 2023, we incurred a total of $15.5 million and $26.5 million, respectively, of internal and external expenses related to our acquisition and development of real estate facilities. These amounts are net of $17.2 million and $18.0 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in development costs that were capitalized to newly developed and redeveloped self-storage facilities. The year-over-year decrease of real estate acquisition and development expense was primarily due to the write-off of $11.7 million of accumulated development costs for cancelled development and redevelopment projects during 2023.\n46\nGeneral and administrative expense:\n The following table sets forth our general and administrative expense: \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\n \n(Amounts in thousands)\nShare-based compensation expense \n$\n28,708 \n$\n25,399 \n$\n3,309 \nLegal costs \n11,690 \n3,304 \n8,386 \nCorporate management costs\n30,436 \n26,284 \n4,152 \nInformation technology costs\n12,110 \n6,495 \n5,615 \nOther costs \n23,733 \n19,150 \n4,583 \nTotal \n$\n106,677 \n$\n80,632 \n$\n26,045 \nGeneral and administrative expense increased $26.0 million in 2024, as compared to 2023 due primarily to (i) ) an increase in corporate management costs driven primarily by higher payroll costs and (ii) an increase in license and maintenance support costs related to our recently implemented IT applications. Additionally, in 2024 we incurred a cash and stock hiring bonus for a new senior executive of $3.5 million and recognized loss contingencies related to corporate legal matters of $3.3 million.\nInterest and other income:\n The following table sets forth our interest and other income: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(Amounts in thousands)\nInterest earned on cash balances\n$\n44,659 \n$\n64,819 \n$\n(20,160)\nCommercial operations\n8,951 \n9,531 \n(580)\nUnrealized gain on private equity investments\n4,355 \n2,817 \n1,538 \nOther\n9,247 \n8,423 \n824 \nTotal \n$\n67,212 \n$\n85,590 \n$\n(18,378)\nInterest earned on cash balances decreased $20.2 million in 2024 over 2023, due primarily to lower average cash balances partially offset by higher interest rates earned in the first half of 2024.\nInterest expense:\n For 2024 and 2023, we incurred $297.9 million and $210.4 million, respectively, of interest on our outstanding notes payable. In determining interest expense, these amounts were offset by capitalized interest of $10.5 million and $9.3 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively, associated with our development activities. The increase of interest expense in 2024 as compared to 2023 is due to the issuance of $2.2 billion of notes payable in July 2023 and the increase of Compounded SOFR on our variable rate unsecured notes. At December 31, 2024, we had $9.4 billion of notes payable outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.1%.\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss):\n For 2024, we recorded foreign currency gains of $102.2 million, representing primarily the changes in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Euro-denominated unsecured notes due to fluctuations in exchange rates (losses of $51.2 million for 2023). The Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.039 U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2024 and 1.104 at December 31, 2023. Future gains and losses on foreign currency will be dependent upon changes in the relative value of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar and the level of Euro-denominated notes payable outstanding.\nGain on sale of real estate: \nIn 2024, we recorded $1.5 million in gains, in connection with the sale of land parcels and the partial sale of real estate facilities pursuant to eminent domain proceedings.\n47\nDuring 2023, we completed a real estate transaction with a third-party, through which we sold an operating self-storage facility with a net book value of $7.1 million for gross proceeds of $40.0 million and acquired a nearby land parcel for $13.5 million. At the close of the transaction, we entered into a leaseback of the self-storage facility until we complete development of the acquired land into a self-storage facility, no later than December 31, 2026. Of the $40.0 million in gross proceeds, $24.3 million was allocated to the sale of the property based on its estimated fair value, resulting a net gain on sale of real estate of $17.1 million after direct transaction costs, and $15.7 million was classified as a reduction of costs to develop the acquired land included in construction in process.\nDuring 2023, we also sold a land parcel for $0.1 million in cash and recorded a related gain on sale of real estate of $0.1 million.\nIncome tax expense:\n We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. In 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense totaling $4.7 million and $10.8 million, respectively, related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries and income taxes incurred in certain state and local jurisdictions in which we operate. The year-over-year changes of income tax expense was primarily driven by changes in state income tax, due to fluctuations of taxable income in certain states where there are differences between federal and state tax laws.\n48\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview and our Sources of Capital\nWhile operating as a REIT allows us to minimize the payment of U.S. federal corporate income tax expense, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. Notwithstanding this requirement, our annual operating retained cash flow was approximately $480 million in 2023 and $400 million in 2024. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities (including property operating costs and interest payments described below), less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures. We expect retained cash flow of approximately $600 million for 2025.\nCapital needs in excess of retained cash flow are met with: (i) medium and long-term debt, (ii) preferred equity, (iii) limited partnership interests, and (iv) common equity. We select among these sources of capital based upon relative cost, availability, the desire for leverage, and considering potential constraints caused by certain features of capital sources, such as debt covenants. We view our line of credit, as well as any short-term bank loans, as bridge financing. \nBecause raising capital is important to our growth, we endeavor to maintain a strong financial profile characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. We are one of the highest rated REITs, as rated by major rating agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Our senior notes payable have an “A” credit rating by Standard & Poor’s and “A2” by Moody’s. Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are “A3” by Moody’s and “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s. Our credit profile enables us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital.\nOur revolving line of credit has a borrowing limit of $1.5 billion. The revolving line of credit generally serves as a temporary “bridge” financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. As of December 31, 2024 and February 24, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit; however, we do have approximately $19.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, which limits our borrowing capacity to $1,480.4 million as of February 24, 2025. Our line of credit matures on June 12, 2027.\nIn 2024, our Board authorized an “at the market” offering program pursuant to which management may issue common shares up to an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Through December 31, 2024 and February 24, 2025, we have issued a total of 184,390 common shares on the open market for an aggregate gross sales price of $61.4 million and received net proceeds of approximately $60.3 million after issuance costs.\nWe believe that we have significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and opportunities, and we have significant access to sources of capital including debt and preferred equity. Based on our strong credit profile and our substantial current liquidity relative to our capital requirements noted below, we would not expect any potential capital market dislocations to have a material impact upon our expected capital and growth plans over the next 12 months. However, if capital market conditions deteriorate significantly for a long period of time, our access to or cost of debt and preferred equity capital could be negatively impacted and potentially affect future investment activities.\nOur current and expected capital resources include: (i) $447.4 million of cash as of December 31, 2024 and (ii)  approximately $600 million of expected retained operating cash flow over the next twelve months. Additionally, we have $1,480.4 million available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, which can be used as temporary “bridge” financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. We believe that our cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing cash requirements for interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.\nAs described below, our current committed cash requirements consist of (i) $140.7 million in property acquisitions currently under contract, (ii) $433.5 million of remaining spending on our current development pipeline, which will be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months, and (iii) approximately $651 million  in scheduled principal repayments on our unsecured notes in the next twelve months. We plan to refinance these unsecured notes as they come due in 2025. Our cash requirements may increase over the next year as we add projects to our development pipeline and acquire additional properties. Additional potential cash requirements could result from various activities including the redemption of outstanding preferred securities, repurchases of common stock, or merger and acquisition activities, as and to the extent we determine to engage in such activities.\n49\nOver the long term, to the extent that our cash requirements exceed our capital resources, we believe we have a variety of possibilities to raise additional capital including issuing common or preferred securities, debt, and limited partnership interests, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.\nCash Requirements\nThe following summarizes our expected material cash requirements, which comprise (i) contractually obligated expenditures, including payments of principal and interest, (ii) other essential expenditures, including property operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and dividends paid in accordance with REIT distribution requirements, and (iii) opportunistic expenditures, including acquisitions and developments and repurchases of our securities. We expect to satisfy these cash requirements through operating cash flow and opportunistic debt and equity financings.\nRequired Debt Repayments:\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the principal outstanding on our debt totaled approximately $9.4 billion, consisting of $7.8 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured notes payable, $1.7 billion of Euro-denominated unsecured notes payable, and $1.7 million of mortgage notes payable. Approximate principal maturities and interest payments (including $111.1 million in estimated interest on our $1.1 billion variable rate unsecured notes based on rates in effect at December 31, 2024) are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nPrincipal\nInterest\nTotal\n2025\n$\n651,516\n$\n280,094\n$\n931,610\n2026\n1,150,138\n256,595\n1,406,733\n2027\n1,200,146\n225,594\n1,425,740\n2028\n1,200,129\n185,047\n1,385,176\n2029\n1,000,088\n147,034\n1,147,122\nThereafter \n4,203,350\n1,423,255\n5,626,605\n$\n9,405,367\n$\n2,517,619\n$\n11,922,986\nWe have $400 million of our U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured notes that mature on July 25, 2025 and €242 million of our Euro denominated unsecured notes that mature on November 3, 2025. We plan to refinance these unsecured notes as they come due.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements:\n Capital expenditures include general maintenance, major repairs, or replacements to elements of our facilities to keep our facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal. Capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or redevelopment of existing facilities to increase their available rentable square footage. \nWe spent $240 million of capital expenditures to maintain real estate facilities in 2024 and expect to spend approximately $150 million in 2025. In addition to standard capital repairs of building elements reaching the end of their useful lives, our capital expenditures in recent years have included incremental expenditures to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors pursuant to a multi-year Property of Tomorrow program. Such investments include development of more pronounced, attractive, and clearly identifiable color schemes and signage and upgrades to the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. We completed this program in 2024 and spent approximately $127 million in 2024 on this effort. In addition, we have spent $54 million on the installation of solar panels in 2024 and we expect to spend approximately $50 million in 2025.\nWe believe the capital spent to install solar panels and LED lights will significantly reduce electric utility usage resulting in lower property operating costs. \nRequirement to Pay Distributions:\n For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our “REIT taxable income” (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT.\n \n50\nOn February 21, 2025, our Board declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $3.00 per common share totaling approximately $526 million, which will be paid at the end of March 2025. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute our taxable income. Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash flows from operating activities.\nThe annual distribution requirement with respect to our preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2024 is approximately $194.7 million per year. \nReal Estate Investment Activities:\n \nWe continue to seek to acquire additional self-storage facilities from third parties. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, we acquired or were under contract to acquire nine self-storage facilities for a total purchase price of $140.7 million. \nWe are actively seeking to acquire additional facilities. However, future acquisition volume will depend upon whether additional owners will be motivated to market their facilities, which will in turn depend upon factors such as economic conditions and the level of seller confidence. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had development and expansion projects at a total cost of approximately $741.6 million. Costs incurred through December 31, 2024 were $308.1 million, with the remaining cost to complete of $433.5 million expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months. Some of these projects are subject to contingencies such as entitlement approval. We expect to continue to seek to add projects to maintain and increase our robust pipeline. Our ability to do so continues to be challenged by various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage facilities in certain municipalities.\nProperty Operating Expenses:\n The direct and indirect cost of our operations impose significant cash requirements.  Direct operating costs include property taxes, on-site property manager payroll, repairs and maintenance, utilities, and marketing.  Indirect operating costs include supervisory payroll and centralized management costs.  The cash requirements from these operating costs will vary year to year based on, among other things, changes in the size of our portfolio and changes in property tax rates and assessed values, wage rates, and marketing costs in our markets.\nRedemption of Preferred Securities\n: Historically, we have taken advantage of refinancing higher coupon preferred securities with lower coupon preferred securities. In the future, we may also elect to finance the redemption of preferred securities with proceeds from the issuance of debt. As of February 24, 2025, we have six series of preferred securities that are eligible for redemption, at our option and with 30 days’ notice: our 5.150% Series F Preferred Shares ($280.0 million), 5.050% Series G Preferred Shares ($300.0 million), 5.600% Series H Preferred Shares ($285.0 million), 4.875% Series I Preferred Shares ($316.3 million), 4.700% Series J Preferred Shares ($258.8 million), and 4.750% Series K Preferred Shares ($230.0 million). See Note 9 to our December 31, 2024 consolidated financial statements for the redemption dates of all of our series of preferred shares. Redemption of such preferred shares will depend upon many factors, including the rate at which we could issue replacement preferred securities. None of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.\nRepurchases of Common Shares\n: Our Board has authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which management may purchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2024, we repurchased 726,865 of our common shares under the repurchase program on the open market for a total cost of $200.0 million (none in the three months ended December 31, 2024). From the inception of the repurchase program through February 24, 2025, we have repurchased a total of 24,448,781 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $879.1 million. All the repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an authorized and unissued status. Future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.\n51",
