  "item1": "Item 1. Business \nGeneral Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and AVs, software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\nElectric Vehicles\n  We are offering customers choice with our diverse EV lineup. A key element in our EV strategy is our dedicated EV propulsion architecture. Our current-generation, flexible EV platform is being deployed across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, leveraging our technology to expand our EV portfolio over a wide and growing variety of segments and price points. With our next-generation battery technology, we intend to expand to multiple chemistries, multiple form factors and multiple cell suppliers as we continue to deliver even more EV choices for our customers.\nTo support our expanding portfolio of EVs, we have made significant investments in our plants across North America. GM’s Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center is a fully dedicated EV facility which produces a variety of vehicles, including the GMC HUMMER EV Pickup and SUV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the recently launched Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, with globally sourced parts. GM's CAMI Assembly is Canada's first full-scale EV manufacturing facility. We plan to convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with the plant slated to begin production in 2026. GM is also investing in our propulsion, stamping and components plants to support EV production. We are mass-producing battery cells for these and other future EVs through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with plans to expand our battery cell manufacturing footprint, including in Indiana through a joint venture with Samsung SDI.\nGM's all-electric future is guided by customer choice and focused on delivering a world-class portfolio of EVs and an ecosystem to support them, while maintaining a compelling lineup of gas-powered vehicles. GM EV drivers have access to more than 231,000 chargers across North America. This includes access to more than 20,000 Tesla Superchargers with the use of a GM-approved North American Charging Standard adapter. In 2024, GM also announced that it will enhance its collaboration with EVgo to build 2,850 DC fast charging stalls, including 400 fast chargers at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. GM is also a founding member of IONNA, a joint venture with seven other automakers aiming to create a high-powered charging network with a targeted installation of at least 30,000 chargers in urban and highway locations throughout North America. The joint venture broke ground on its first charging station in October 2024.\nSoftware-Enabled Services and Subscriptions\n \nOur vehicles are equipped with a suite of software-enabled services, including OnStar services, Super Cruise and others. With nearly three decades of experience, OnStar is a global leader in enabling automotive services. OnStar is currently available in 20 markets globally and growing. As GM introduces more software-defined vehicles, OnStar is playing a key role as an enabler of active safety, infotainment, connectivity and driver assistance features. OnStar provides one ecosystem for retail and fleet customers to use, engage and shop through a broader set of service offerings available at and after vehicle purchase. Our end-to-end software platform provides customers with \n1\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nsoftware-defined features, apps and services over-the-air and will empower customers to update their ownership experiences with desirable features, software services, vehicle performance and Super Cruise. Super Cruise enables drivers of properly equipped vehicles to travel hands-free on more than 530,000 miles of compatible roads, and soon to be approximately 750,000 miles, in the U.S. and Canada. Additional software-enabled features are expected to be available in the near future including security features, climate and comfort options, personal themes and EV ownership experience elements. Many of GM's latest electric and internal combustion vehicles are employing this software platform as it rolls out across most products in the coming years.\nCruise\n  GM Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. We are pursuing the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Cruise, and as of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 97% of Cruise. Following the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests and subject to approval of the Cruise Board of Directors, we expect to work with the Cruise leadership team to restructure Cruise's operations and combine the GM and Cruise technical efforts to build on the success of Super Cruise and prioritize the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) on a path to fully autonomous personal vehicles. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the risks associated with our AV strategy.\nOver the last year, we have engaged and actively cooperated with certain federal and state agencies who opened investigations or made inquiries to us and Cruise in connection with an accident involving a Cruise robotaxi in October 2023. We and Cruise have resolved the investigations and inquiries by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the U.S. Department of Justice and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Specifically, in July 2024, Cruise entered into a settlement agreement with the CPUC that imposed a $112,500 fine on Cruise and various reporting obligations. In September 2024, Cruise and NHTSA executed a Consent Order, which imposed a $1.5 million fine on Cruise and requires enhanced reporting and engagement with NHTSA for two years (with an optional third year at NHTSA's discretion). In November 2024, Cruise entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California relating to the October 2023 accident. Under the terms of the DPA, Cruise admitted to one count of submitting a false report to a federal agency and paid a $500,000 monetary penalty. The government will not pursue an indictment or prosecution so long as Cruise complies with the terms of the DPA over the next three years by undertaking certain remedial measures, maintaining a safety compliance program and submitting reports to the government no less than annually. GM is neither a party nor a signatory to these agreements. \nCompetitive Position and Vehicle Sales\n \nThe principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy or range and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.\nWe present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and market share. Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors, as well as sales to the U.S. government, and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2024, 27.9% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands): \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGMNA\n3,464 \n86.4 \n%\n3,147 \n83.5 \n%\n2,926 \n81.8 \n%\nGMI\n547 \n13.6 \n%\n621 \n16.5 \n%\n653 \n18.2 \n%\nTotal\n4,010 \n100.0 \n%\n3,768 \n100.0 \n%\n3,579 \n100.0 \n%\nTotal vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales (i.e., sales to large and small businesses, governments and daily rental car companies); and (3) sales of courtesy transportation vehicles (i.e., vehicles previously used by dealers that were sold to the end consumer). Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative \n2\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nof the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by our dealers, distributors and joint ventures; commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data; and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.\n The following table summarizes industry and GM total vehicle sales and our related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands): \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nIndustry\nGM\nMarket Share\nIndustry\nGM\nMarket Share\nIndustry\nGM\nMarket Share\nNorth America\nUnited States\n16,385 \n2,705 \n16.5 \n%\n16,022 \n2,595 \n16.2 \n%\n14,242 \n2,274 \n16.0 \n%\nOther\n3,909 \n510 \n13.1 \n%\n3,590 \n460 \n12.8 \n%\n3,066 \n406 \n13.2 \n%\nTotal North America\n20,294 \n3,215 \n15.8 \n%\n19,612 \n3,055 \n15.6 \n%\n17,308 \n2,680 \n15.5 \n%\nAsia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa\nChina(a)\n26,567 \n1,839 \n6.9 \n%\n24,967 \n2,099 \n8.4 \n%\n23,489 \n2,303 \n9.8 \n%\nOther\n21,727 \n520 \n2.4 \n%\n22,058 \n577 \n2.6 \n%\n20,259 \n505 \n2.5 \n%\nTotal Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa\n48,293 \n2,359 \n4.9 \n%\n47,025 \n2,676 \n5.7 \n%\n43,748 \n2,808 \n6.4 \n%\nSouth America\nBrazil\n2,634 \n315 \n12.0 \n%\n2,307 \n328 \n14.2 \n%\n2,103 \n291 \n13.8 \n%\nOther\n1,347 \n109 \n8.1 \n%\n1,419 \n128 \n9.0 \n%\n1,563 \n160 \n10.3 \n%\nTotal South America\n3,980 \n424 \n10.7 \n%\n3,726 \n456 \n12.2 \n%\n3,666 \n451 \n12.3 \n%\nTotal in GM markets\n72,568 \n5,998 \n8.3 \n%\n70,362 \n6,187 \n8.8 \n%\n64,722 \n5,939 \n9.2 \n%\nTotal Europe\n16,816 \n2 \n— \n%\n16,596 \n2 \n— \n%\n14,236 \n2 \n— \n%\nTotal Worldwide(b)(c)\n89,383 \n6,001 \n6.7 \n%\n86,958 \n6,189 \n7.1 \n%\n78,958 \n5,941 \n7.5 \n%\nUnited States\nCars\n2,939 \n178 \n6.0 \n%\n3,070 \n224 \n7.3 \n%\n2,815 \n214 \n7.6 \n%\nTrucks\n4,345 \n1,383 \n31.8 \n%\n4,249 \n1,303 \n30.7 \n%\n3,974 \n1,246 \n31.4 \n%\nCrossovers\n9,101 \n1,144 \n12.6 \n%\n8,702 \n1,068 \n12.3 \n%\n7,454 \n814 \n10.9 \n%\nTotal United States\n16,385 \n2,705 \n16.5 \n%\n16,022 \n2,595 \n16.2 \n%\n14,242 \n2,274 \n16.0 \n%\nChina(a)\nSGMS\n524 \n870 \n1,037 \nSGMW\n1,315 \n1,229 \n1,266 \nTotal China\n26,567 \n1,839 \n6.9 \n%\n24,967 \n2,099 \n8.4 \n%\n23,489 \n2,303 \n9.8 \n%\n__________\n \n(a)\nIncludes sales by the Automotive China Joint Ventures (Automotive China JVs): SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd.

We sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands): \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGMNA\n615 \n679 \n564 \nGMI\n401 \n506 \n426 \nTotal fleet sales\n1,016 \n1,185 \n990 \nFleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales\n16.9 \n%\n19.2 \n%\n16.7 \n%\nProduct Pricing\n \nSeveral methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives, such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. \nCyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business\n \nThe market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. Vehicle markets are also seasonal. Production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. \nRelationship with Dealers\n \nWe market vehicles and automotive parts primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. Our customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. The number of authorized dealerships and other agents performing similar functions were 4,588 in GMNA and 6,594 in GMI at December 31, 2024.\nWe, and our joint ventures, enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those products to customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty, and those repairs are made almost exclusively with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts, which may be provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions. \nThe quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers are critical to our success now, and as we transition to our all-electric future, given that they maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters. \nResearch, Product Development and Intellectual Property\n \nCosts for research, manufacturing engineering, software engineering, product engineering and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control, improved fuel economy, EVs, AVs and the safety of drivers and passengers. Research and development expenses were $9.2 billion, $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nProduct Development\n \nThe Global Product Development organization is responsible for designing, developing, validating and integrating all global products, services and their components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where our global teams in Design, Program Management & Execution, Hardware, Systems & Integration, Product Safety, Systems & Certification, Electrification & Battery Systems, Technology Acceleration & Commercialization and Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale.\nWe continue to invest in key ICE segments, which are critical to fund our all-electric future. Cross-segment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our vehicle portfolio profitability, with more than 75% of our global internal combustion vehicle \n4\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nsales volume expected to come from five internal combustion vehicle architectures through this decade. We will continue to leverage our ICE portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals.\nSoftware and Services\n \nThe Software & Services organization, with a presence in Mountain View, California and globally, is bringing together all of GM's software capabilities and assets under one team for the first time at GM. The team is developing and implementing an integrated strategy, working closely with the Global Product Development organization and others across the enterprise to deliver an end-to-end integrated software and services strategy that will make the driver experience even more compelling and seamless.\nIntellectual Property\n  We are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries. While no single piece of intellectual property is individually material to our business as a whole, our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued technological development. Additionally, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.  \nRaw Materials, Services and Supplies\n  We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, systems, components, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead, precious metals and raw materials used in EVs. We do not normally carry substantial inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements, and while we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, supply disruptions may occur as a result of geopolitical and/or policy actions. Processing and extraction of certain EV battery raw materials is currently concentrated in China and may be subject to import or export restrictions, or tariffs. In addition, our transition to EVs will require developing a more resilient, scalable and sustainable North America-focused EV supply chain, which includes advancing our strategic sourcing initiatives to secure supply through investments in raw materials suppliers and the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements with suppliers throughout the value chain. This includes securing supply through offtake agreements for EV raw materials and derivatives thereof, such as lithium, cathode active material, manganese, synthetic and natural graphite, nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements and permanent motor magnets. These EV-related agreements may require us to hold higher than normal levels of EV raw materials inventory and to make long-term commitments to purchase raw materials. Expected demand for these raw materials currently exceeds the North American capacity of the existing supply chain and our raw material sourcing strategy aims to secure raw material supply to support our EV transition.\nCommodity costs are reflecting greater variability due to the macroeconomic environment and the continuing existence of government policies. \nFurthermore, an increased demand for EV critical minerals is increasing scrutiny of the sustainability and human rights implications of these supply chains.\nIn some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source, which may increase risk to supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to provide us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were approximately 11% of our total purchases in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks. \nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial  \nGM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through joint ventures in China. \nGM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum to support vehicle sales. Additionally, GM Financial offers commercial lending products to dealers including floorplan financing, which is lending to finance new and used vehicle inventory; and dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain GM subsidiaries.\nIn North America, GM Financial offers a sub-prime lending program. The program is primarily offered to consumers with a FICO score or its equivalent of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending. \n5\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGM Financial generally seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, securitization transactions and the issuance of unsecured debt in the capital markets.\nHuman Capital  \nThe foundation of GM’s business is our Purpose: We pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters. It is why we exist. Our Purpose, growth strategy and culture all help us on our path towards achieving our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. Our people are our most valuable asset, and we must continue to attract and retain the best talent in the world in order to achieve this vision. As a result, we strive to create a Workplace of Choice to attract, retain, motivate and develop top talent by adhering to a responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job opportunities, pay workers fairly, ensure safety and well-being and foster an inclusive work environment in which all employees can perform at their best. Fundamental to these commitments are our company values.\nBuilding a Stronger Future Together\n  Attracting and retaining talent to build great vehicles is critical to thriving in an increasingly competitive landscape. Our company initiatives for inclusivity are created to further our main business objective – to build and sell the best vehicles on the market to everyone, everywhere. Our current Board of Directors includes six women and seven men of different backgrounds who contribute their own unique perspective, industry insights, experiences and expertise. We bring together best-in-class talent to innovate in an inclusive work environment, and our guiding principle is performance. We have a talent management system that underscores our commitment to high standards. We extend outside of GM to reduce barriers and improve access to our products and services by aligning to GM's focus on STEAM education and road safety. This includes our investments in communities through many partnerships and volunteerism.\nDevelop and Retain Talented People \n Today, we compete for talent not only against other automotive companies, but with businesses in sectors such as technology. To win and retain that talent, we must encourage employee behaviors that align with our values, fulfill employees' long-term aspirations and provide experiences that make them feel valued, included and engaged. We have introduced various tools to outline expectations of our employees at each stage of our career ladder in terms of role scope, skills and behaviors. Along with providing mentoring and networking opportunities, we offer a vast array of career development resources to employees to make the most of their careers at GM. We have established curricula for each of our functional areas aimed at ensuring that our employees have the skills they need to perform their jobs. We also offer continuing education programs from leading colleges and universities. For example, the Technical Education Program provides employees an opportunity to complete corporate strategically aligned degrees and certificate programs. Employees in some of our technical roles can participate in the GM Technical Learning University — a training and upskilling program designed to expand and update the technical abilities of our workforce.\nGM recognizes that leadership effectiveness is a critical business need. We continue to expand our leadership development programs, which are designed to deliver skills and behaviors for each level of leadership to effectively lead their teams. Focus areas range from delivering constructive feedback to effectively leading large scale change initiatives.\nSafety and Well-Being\n  The safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely — \n6\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEvery Person, Every Site, Every Day. Our unwavering commitment to safety is manifested through empowering employees to “Speak Up for Safety” and the Employee Safety Concern Process. These resources make it easier for salaried, hourly or represented and contract employees to report potential vehicle or workplace safety issues, or to suggest safety related improvements without fear of retaliation. The well-being of our employees is equally as important to entice and stimulate creativity and innovation. \nOur award-winning Total Rewards package includes support for physical, emotional and financial wellness. We provide a comprehensive, competitive offering that includes compensation, a 401(k) company contribution and matching program, paid time off for holidays and vacations, a high-quality health care plan, and GM Family First savings on GM vehicles, parts and services. We are committed to creating safe spaces where people can perform and thrive at work. GM encourages and supports healthy behaviors, attitudes and actions in our workplaces to improve health outcomes for team members and their families and to contribute to the success of our business.\nEmployees\n \nAt December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 90,000 (55%) hourly employees and approximately 72,000 (45%) salaried employees. At December 31, 2024, substantially all of our hourly U.S. employees (approximately 47,000) were represented by unions, a majority of which were represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).

Emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world, often with very little harmonization. Regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\nThe U.S. federal government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards. The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt California emission standards in lieu of federal requirements. Various other states have adopted California emission standards, and there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California emission standards in the future. The EPA has finalized its Tier 4 Multipollutant Rule that will begin with the 2027 model year. The historically stringent proposal calls for ever-increasing volumes of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) in order to maintain compliance.\nFor each model year, we must obtain certification that our vehicles and engines will meet emission requirements of the EPA before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and of CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and the states that have adopted California emission standards.\nThe Canadian federal government's current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with U.S. federal requirements. \nIn 2019, certain areas within China began implementation of the China 6 emission standard (China 6) requirements. China 6 combines elements of both European Union (EU) and U.S. standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation of China 6a for new registrations occurred in January 2021, and the more stringent China 6b was implemented in July 2023. In 2022, China began studies regarding the next generation of vehicle emission standards (China 7), with the final standard expected in 2026. While largely based on Euro 7, some divergence and unique requirements are expected.\nBrazil has approved a set of national emission standards referred to as L7, implemented in 2022, and L8, to be implemented from 2025 onward. L7 standards cover vehicle exhaust emissions, durability for emissions, evaporative emissions and noise limits, and include additional OBD requirements and a phase-in for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems. L8 standards include corporate average vehicle emissions targets, which increase in stringency every two years until 2031. Some of the requirements are aligned with those of the EPA.  \nAs a result of the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the Opel/Vauxhall Business), GM’s vehicle presence in Europe is smaller, but GM may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to Opel/Vauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as well as to other vehicles GM continues to sell in Europe. In Europe, increased scrutiny of emission standards compliance may result in changes to these standards, as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. Beyond this, as part of the EU's desire to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility, the EU has recently rolled out new regulations which will impose more stringent emissions standards on ICE vehicles (Euro 7), before phasing them out in 2035. New regulations that are already in place and for which technical requirements are currently being shaped will also impact EV battery design, use and recyclability/recycling. For additional information, refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAutomotive Fuel Economy and GHG Emissions\n \n In the U.S., NHTSA promulgates and enforces Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestic cars, import cars and light-duty trucks. Manufacturers may use one or a combination of the following to resolve CAFE fleet deficits: credits from the five prior model years, expected credits for the next three model years, credits obtained from other manufacturers or payment of civil penalties. Manufacturers that do not resolve deficits for a model year may be subject to substantial CAFE civil penalties to bring their fleets into compliance. In addition to federal CAFE standards, the EPA promulgates and enforces GHG emission standards. Manufacturers may use one or a combination of the following to resolve EPA GHG fleet deficits: credits from the five prior model years, expected credits for the next three model years and credits obtained from other manufacturers. NHTSA and the EPA have previously finalized separate standards with differing stringency levels and affected model years, with the CAFE standards addressing the 2024–\n8\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n2026 model years and the GHG standards addressing the 2023–2026 model years and both standards have been challenged through litigation. In 2024, NHTSA finalized CAFE standards for the 2027–2031 model years and the EPA finalized GHG standards for the 2027–2032 model years. NHTSA and the EPA have also finalized on-going fuel efficiency and GHG emissions requirements for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. These requirements also increase in stringency over time.\nIn addition, CARB has promulgated and enforces its own light-duty vehicle GHG standards with increasing stringency through model year 2025, and other states have adopted CARB's GHG standards under the Federal Clean Air Act. GM is required to meet state GHG standards in California and the states that have adopted California’s GHG standards. CARB has not proposed increases to its GHG standards for the 2026 or later model years, but may do so in the future.  \nCARB has also imposed requirements to sell increasing percentages of ZEVs in California, ending with a 100% sales target in the 2035 model year. This includes CARB's Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) program, which requires the sale of increasing percentages of light-duty ZEVs for the 2026–2035 model years, and has been adopted by numerous states. CARB received a waiver from the EPA for it and the other adopting states to implement and enforce the ACC II program and that waiver action has been challenged through litigation. Additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt CARB’s ACC II requirements in the future. CARB has also imposed a ZEV requirement for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in its Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) program, requiring increasing percentages of ZEVs for the 2024–2026 model years, ending with a 100% ZEV sales requirement in the 2036 model year. CARB has a waiver from the EPA to enforce ACT.\nIn Canada, federal light- and heavy-duty GHG regulations contain emission standards that are modeled on existing U.S. EPA light- and heavy-duty GHG emission standards for the 2023–2026 model years. In December 2023, the Canadian federal government announced the ZEV Availability Standard as a new requirement within the existing light-duty GHG emission standard, which requires a specified percentage of manufacturer's new light-duty vehicles offered for sale in Canada to be ZEV, beginning with model year 2026 and increasing each year to 100% by model year 2035, and potential enforcement actions for non-compliance in accordance with the existing GHG standards. At the provincial level, Quebec and British Columbia have enacted ZEV sales requirements, which include potential monetary penalties for non-compliance. In 2023, Quebec amended its light-duty ZEV regulations applicable to 2025–2035 model years, requiring ZEVs to comprise 100% of all new light-duty vehicle sales by model year 2035. In December 2024, the Quebec government adopted regulations that prohibit the sale or lease of certain internal combustion engines by December 31, 2035. In October 2024, the British Columbia government announced amendments to British Columbia's existing ZEV sales requirements, which would require ZEVs to comprise 100% of new light-duty sales in British Columbia by model year 2035. \nChina has two fuel consumption requirements for passenger vehicles enforced by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a corporate average fuel consumption (CAFC) requirement. Specific to the CAFC requirement, China introduced Phase 5 in 2021 with full compliance required by 2025. In addition, China has established a mandate that requires passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, which are referred to as New Energy Vehicles (NEVs), from 2019 and beyond. The number of NEV credits per car is based on the electric range, energy efficiency and battery energy density with the goal of increasing NEV volume penetrations and improving technological sophistication over time. Uncommitted NEV credits may be used to assist compliance with the CAFC requirement. China previously issued NEV credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and has set new NEV credit targets aimed at further increasing NEV volumes for 2024 and 2025. In 2022, China began to study the CAFC requirement and NEV credit mandates for 2026–2030 (referred to as Phase 6) with the final standard expected in 2025. These standards are anticipated to be more stringent, aligned with the trend observed in other key global markets. \nIn Brazil, the Secretary of Industry and Development promulgates and enforces CAFE standards and has enforced a CAFE program for the period October 2020–September 2026 for light-duty and mid-size trucks and SUVs, including diesel vehicles. The second phase of the program was finalized in May 2024 and introduces more stringent requirements from 2027 through 2031.\nWe have several options to comply with existing and potential new regulations that we have utilized and may continue to utilize, including increasing production and sale of certain vehicles, such as EVs, and curtailing production of others, which could include profitable ICE vehicles; technology changes, including fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrades; payment of penalties; and/or the purchase of credits from third parties. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations. In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we paid $2.0 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion to purchase credits to facilitate our compliance with regulations. Compliance-related costs of $1.0 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.5 billion were recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIndustrial Environmental Control\n \nOur operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances, these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. \nChemical Regulations  \nWe continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.\nGlobally, governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing vehicle interior air quality, green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions on Chemicals and Waste, the Minamata Convention on Mercury and EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. Increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. New European requirements require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose substances of concern in parts.  \nChemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S., the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. The EPA has also issued a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule that requires PFAS use reporting by manufacturers between 2011 and 2022. In addition, several U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design and manufacturing such as chemical restriction and use requirements. For example, Minnesota has adopted PFAS reporting and elimination requirements beginning as early as 2026, except for unavoidable uses. Chemical restrictions and export controls in Canada continue to steadily progress under the Environment and Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic. \nThese emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. Manufacturers, including joint venture partners and suppliers, that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to civil penalties, production disruptions or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.\nVehicle Safety\n \nU.S. Requirements\n  The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the U.S. of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial. \nOther National Requirements\n  Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UNECE based regulations with some variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UNECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. Safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are generally aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Global regulations continue to increase in scope \n10\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwith new technologies, some of which can be market-specific, that can add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.  \nCrash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs\n  Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S., rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars or other grading systems, depending on the region, to rate vehicle safety. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.  \nWebsite Access to Our Reports  \nOur internet website address is https://www.gm.com.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\n is incorporated by reference into this MD&A. \nOverview\n  Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We will adapt to customer preferences while executing our growth-focused strategy to invest in EVs, hybrids, personal AV technology, software-enabled services and other new business opportunities. To support strong margins and cash flow during this transition, we are strengthening our market position in profitable ICE vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We plan to execute our strategy \n26\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwith a steadfast commitment to good corporate citizenship through more sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.\nOur financial performance in 2024 was driven by the strength of our vehicle portfolio including high margin full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, strong consumer demand for our products and the execution of our core business strategy. We remain focused on maintaining an efficient cost structure and pricing discipline. We are monitoring industry pricing pressures, changing interest rates, inflation, warranty claims, consumer demand trends and potential changes in the regulatory environment. We continue to prioritize driving down costs and building scale in our EV portfolio to improve profitability.\nAs we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results. Refer to the \"Consolidated Results\" and regional sections of this MD&A for additional information.\nWe face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2025, we expect earnings per share (EPS)-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $11.00 and $12.00, Net income attributable to stockholders of between $11.2 billion and $12.5 billion and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted of between $13.7 billion and $15.7 billion. These expected financial results do not include the potential impact of future adjustments related to special items. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this MD&A for additional information.\nThe following table reconciles expected Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to expected EBIT-adjusted (dollars in billions):\nYear Ending December 31, 2025\nNet income attributable to stockholders\n$ 11.2-12.5\nIncome tax expense \n2.5-3.2\nAutomotive interest income, net\n(0.0)\nEBIT-adjusted(a)\n$ 13.7-15.7\n__________\n(a)\nWe do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results.\nGMNA  \nIndustry sales in North America were 20.3 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 3.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. U.S. industry sales were 16.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 2.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.7 million units for a market share of 16.5% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023. \nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2025 on the continuing strength of our product portfolio, improving EV margins and continuing cost discipline, partially offset by pricing moderation with increased incentives and higher depreciation expense. While we expect EV margins to improve in 2025, we may continue to recognize losses to adjust inventory to net realizable value. Our outlook is dependent on continued supply chain availability, EV-related cost reduction and the resiliency of the U.S. economy and overall economic conditions, including the potential imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions by the U.S. or its trading partners.\nGMI  \nIndustry sales in China were 26.6 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 6.4% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales in China were 1.8 million units resulting in a market share of 6.9% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 1.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Intense price competition with significant excess capacity from both new market entrants and established competitors offering vehicles at lower prices and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEVs continue to negatively impact the profitability of our operations in China. Additionally, \n27\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwe believe independent, Chinese automakers are expanding market share and prioritizing production volumes over profitability, with the ability to produce vehicles at costs well below foreign automakers, including our Automotive China JVs. These factors are impacting our China JVs’ ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JVs. We are in the late stages of finalizing details with our JV partners on an agreement regarding certain restructuring actions, which include plant closures and portfolio optimization to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions, and updated business forecasts.  \nBased on the updated forecast, we determined that the material loss in value of our equity interests in SAIC General Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), SAIC GM (Shenyang) Norsom Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM Norsom), SAIC GM Dong Yue Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM DY) and SAIC GM Dong Yue Powertrain Co., Ltd. (SGM DYPT) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 which is included in equity income (loss). Our Automotive China JVs' equity losses also includes non-cash charges of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of the restructuring plan. We expect additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred in 2025. Going forward, we will continue to assess our strategy in the Chinese market to maintain presence while prioritizing profitability. In addition, GM Financial also concluded that a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC) existed. Refer to the \"Automotive Financing – GM Financial Summary and Outlook” section of this MD&A for discussion of GM Financial’s other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC.\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.9 million units for a market share of 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\nCruise\n  Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed development work on the Cruise Origin and recorded restructuring charges of $0.6 billion primarily related to non-cash write-offs of Origin assets. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business for a further discussion on Cruise. In conjunction with our announcement to no longer fund Cruise’s robotaxi development work and our plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges of $0.5 billion. These charges primarily relate to anticipated headcount reductions and impairments of real estate lease assets and certain intangible assets.\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook  \nWe believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 42% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-party financing products in the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North America was 81% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 82% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46%, retail finance charge income of 40% and commercial finance charge income of 8%.\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion were included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in gains is primarily due to fewer terminated leases in 2024 compared to 2023. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent \n28\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nestimates and the number of units included in GM Financial Equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nResidual Value\nUnits\nPercentage\nResidual Value\nUnits\nPercentage\nCrossovers\n$\n13,184 \n635 \n67.3 \n%\n$\n12,830 \n648 \n67.5 \n%\nTrucks\n7,458 \n224 \n23.7 \n%\n6,793 \n210 \n21.9 \n%\nSUVs\n2,260 \n53 \n5.6 \n%\n2,304 \n58 \n6.0 \n%\nCars\n590 \n31 \n3.3 \n%\n734 \n44 \n4.6 \n%\nTotal\n$\n23,492 \n943 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n22,661 \n960 \n100.0 \n%\nAs a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions in China, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value. Refer to the \"Overview – GMI\" section of this MD&A for discussion of the China market and associated restructuring actions being taken.\nConsolidated Results  \nWe review changes in our results of operations under five categories: Volume, Mix, Price, Cost and Other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates.

The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns.\nFactors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information on Volume and Mix.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased Cost was primarily due to: (1) decreased inventory adjustments of $2.2 billion, primarily EV-related, to reflect the net realizable value at period end; (2) the absence of charges related to the voluntary separation program (VSP) of $0.7 billion; (3) decreased engineering costs of $0.7 billion, driven primarily by lower AV engineering costs; (4) increased equity earnings related to Ultium Cells Holdings LLC of $0.7 billion; (5) decreased material and freight costs of $0.3 billion; partially offset by (6) increased other employee-related costs of $0.6 billion; (7) increased charges of $0.5 billion related to restructuring costs resulting from the plan to realign Cruise with our existing GM technical teams to develop personal AV technology; (8) increased warranty-related costs of $0.4 billion; and (9) increased information technology costs of $0.3 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2024, favorable Other was primarily due to net foreign currency changes in the Brazilian real and the Korean won.\nAutomotive and Other Selling, General and Administrative Expense\nYears Ended December 31,\nYear Ended \n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)\n%\nAutomotive and other selling, general and administrative expense\n$\n10,621 \n$\n9,840 \n$\n10,667 \n$\n(781)\n(7.9)\n%\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to: (1) increased charges of $0.4 billion related to strategic activities to transition certain Buick dealerships; and (2) increased advertising, selling and administrative costs of $0.3 billion.\n30\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInterest Income and Other Non-operating Income, net\nYears Ended December 31,\nYear Ended \n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)\n%\nInterest income and other non-operating income, net\n$\n1,257 \n$\n1,537 \n$\n1,432 \n$\n(280)\n(18.2)\n%\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, Interest income and other non-operating income, net decreased primarily due to several insignificant items.\nIncome Tax Expense\nYears Ended December 31,\nYear Ended \n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)\n%\nIncome tax expense\n$\n2,556 \n$\n563 \n$\n1,888 \n$\n(1,993)\nn.m.\n__________\nn.m. = not meaningful\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, Income tax expense \nincreased \nprimarily d\nue to jurisdictional mix of earnings and valuation allowance adjustments that occurred in the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted) was\n 20.1%.\n We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 18% and 20% for the year ending December 31, 2025. \nRefer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Income tax expense.\nGM North America \nYears Ended December 31,\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)\nVariance Due To\n2024\n2023\n%\nVolume\nMix\nPrice\nCost\nOther\n(Dollars in billions)\nTotal net sales and revenue\n$\n157,509 \n$\n141,445 \n$\n16,064 \n11.4 \n%\n$\n12.8 \n$\n2.5 \n$\n0.7 \n$\n— \nEBIT-adjusted\n$\n14,528 \n$\n12,306 \n$\n2,222 \n18.1 \n%\n$\n3.9 \n$\n(3.1)\n$\n0.7 \n$\n1.3 \n$\n(0.6)\nEBIT-adjusted margin\n9.2 \n%\n8.7 \n%\n0.5 \n%\n(Vehicles in thousands)\nWholesale vehicle sales\n3,464 \n3,147 \n317 \n10.1 \n%\nGMNA Total Net Sales and Revenue  \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, Total net sales and revenue increased primarily due to: (1) increased net wholesale volumes primarily due to increased sales of full-size pickup trucks, mid-size pickup trucks and other vehicles; (2) favorable Mix associated with increased sales of full-size pickup trucks and full-size SUVs, partially offset by increased sales of crossover vehicles; and (3) favorable Price as a result of stable dealer inventory levels and strong demand for our products.\nGMNA EBIT-Adjusted  \nThe most significant factors that influence profitability are industry volume and market share. While not as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold. Trucks, crossovers and cars sold currently have a variable profit of approximately 160%, 40% and 50% of our GMNA portfolio on a weighted-average basis. \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, EBIT-adjusted increased primarily due to: (1) increased net wholesale volumes primarily due to increased sales of full-size pickup trucks, mid-size pickup trucks and crossover vehicles; (2) favorable Cost primarily due to decreased inventory adjustments of $2.1 billion, primarily EV-related, to reflect the net realizable value at period end, increased equity earnings related to Ultium Cells Holdings LLC of $0.7 billion and decreased material and freight costs of $0.6 billion, partially offset by increased other employee-related costs of $0.7 billion, increased engineering costs of $0.5 billion, primarily due to a decrease in cost sharing arrangements with our Automotive China JVs, increased warranty-\n31\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nrelated costs of $0.4 billion, increased information technology costs of $0.3 billion and increased other cost of sales of $0.3 billion; and (3) favorable Price; partially offset by (4) unfavorable Mix associated with increased sales of crossover vehicles and EVs; and (5) unfavorable Other due to net foreign currency changes primarily in the Mexican peso.\nGM International\nYears Ended December 31,\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)\nVariance Due To\n2024\n2023\n%\nVolume\nMix\nPrice\nCost\nOther\n(Dollars in billions)\nTotal net sales and revenue\n$\n13,890 \n$\n15,949 \n$\n(2,059)\n(12.9)\n%\n$\n(1.6)\n$\n0.4 \n$\n0.2 \n$\n(1.1)\nEBIT-adjusted\n$\n303 \n$\n1,210 \n$\n(907)\n(75.0)\n%\n$\n(0.4)\n$\n0.1 \n$\n0.2 \n$\n(0.2)\n$\n(0.7)\nEBIT-adjusted margin\n2.2 \n%\n7.6 \n%\n(5.4)\n%\nEquity income (loss) — Automotive China\n$\n(4,407)\n$\n446 \n$\n(4,853)\nn.m.\nEBIT-adjusted — excluding Equity income (loss)(a)\n$\n633 \n$\n764 \n$\n(131)\n(17.1)\n%\n(Vehicles in thousands)\nWholesale vehicle sales\n547 \n621 \n(74)\n(11.9)\n%\n__________\nn.m. = not meaningful\n(a)    Excludes adjustments related to Automotive China JVs restructuring recorded in GMI.

The results of our joint ventures are recorded in Equity income (loss), which is included in EBIT-adjusted above.\nGMI Total Net Sales and Revenue \n In the year ended December 31, 2024, Total net sales and revenue decreased primarily due to: (1) decreased net wholesale volumes in South America, in Asia/Pacific and in the Middle East primarily due to decreased sales of passenger cars and crossover vehicles, partially offset by higher sales of trucks; and (2) unfavorable Other primarily due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Brazilian real and Egyptian pound against the U.S. dollar and decreased components sales; partially offset by (3) favorable Mix primarily in Brazil and in the Middle East; and (4) favorable pricing across multiple vehicle lines in the Middle East and in Brazil.\nGMI EBIT-Adjusted \n In the year ended December 31, 2024, EBIT-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) unfavorable Other primarily due to decreased Automotive China JVs equity income (loss); (2) decreased net wholesale volumes; and (3) unfavorable Cost primarily due to increased material costs and unfavorable impact due to nonrecurring asset sale in Korea, partially offset by favorable fixed cost; partially offset by (4) favorable Price; and (5) favorable Mix in South America.\nOur Automotive China JVs’ ability to grow vehicle sales in China and generate sustainable equity income continues to be a challenge due to intense competition from our domestic competitors in the Chinese market. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized equity losses of $4.4 billion driven primarily by impairment and restructuring charges of $4.1 billion for certain of our Automotive China JVs.

Following the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests and subject to the approval of the Cruise Board of Directors, we expect that the plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving will reduce Cruise's costs going forward.\nGM Financial\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n15,875 \n$\n14,225 \n$\n12,766 \n$\n1,650 \n11.6 \n%\nProvision for loan losses\n$\n1,029 \n$\n826 \n$\n654 \n$\n203 \n24.6 \n%\nEBT-adjusted\n$\n2,965 \n$\n2,985 \n$\n4,076 \n$\n(20)\n(0.7)\n%\nAverage debt outstanding (dollars in billions)\n$\n109.0 \n$\n100.4 \n$\n93.8 \n$\n8.6 \n8.6 \n%\nEffective rate of interest paid\n5.5 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n0.8 \n%\nGM Financial Revenue  \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, total revenue increased primarily due to: (1) increased finance charge income of $1.5 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher average interest rates on new loans and growth in the size of the portfolio; and (2) increased other income of $0.2 billion primarily due to higher investment income resulting from an increase in the average investment balance and growth in vehicle protection contracts.\nGM Financial EBT-Adjusted  \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, earnings before income taxes-adjusted (EBT-adjusted) decreased primarily due to: (1) increased interest expense of $1.3 billion primarily due to an increased effective rate of interest on debt, resulting from higher benchmark interest rates on new issuances relative to maturing debt, as well as an increase in average debt outstanding; (2) increased provision for loan losses of $0.2 billion primarily due to increased loan origination volume and moderating credit performance and recovery rates; and (3) decreased equity income of $0.1 billion primarily due to lower earning asset levels at its joint ventures in China; partially offset by (4) increased finance charge income of $1.5 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher average interest rates on new loans and growth in the size of the portfolio; and (5) increased other income of $0.2 billion primarily due to higher investment income resulting from an increase in the average investment balance and growth in vehicle protection contracts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources  \nWe believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the short- and long-term. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. We have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through our total available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary. \nOur known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in our battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of approximately $10.0 billion to $11.0 billion in 2025; (2) payments for engineering and product development activities\n,\n including the development of AV technology and software-enabled services; (3) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls and any other recall-related contingencies; (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (5) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors; (6) payments to purchase shares of our \n33\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\ncommon stock authorized by our Board of Directors; and (7) payments of emissions-related regulatory compliance costs. Refer to Note 7, Note 13 and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional funding requirements for our operating leases, debt and pension plans. Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18.0 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. Our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors not less than once annually. \nWe continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners, as well as strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. To support our transition to EVs, we anticipate making investments in suppliers or providing funding towards the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements to secure critical materials. In addition, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements that generally obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output. These arrangements could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.\nOur liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control. \nIn November 2023, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our previously announced share repurchase program by $10.0 billion to an aggregate of $11.4 billion and approved a $10.0 billion ASR program. In December 2023, pursuant to the agreements entered into in connection with the ASR, we advanced $10.0 billion and received approximately 215 million shares of common stock with a value of $6.8 billion, which were immediately retired. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we received and retired approximately 29 million additional shares upon settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements. The final number of shares received was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less a discount pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements.\nIn June 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to repurchase up to an additional $6.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, \nin addition to shares received under the ASR program, we purchased approximately \n140 million\n shares of our outstanding common stock for\n $7.1 billion.\n We have\n $0.3 billion \nin capacity remaining under our share repurchase program as of December 31, 2024, with no expiration date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid dividends of $0.5 billion to holders of our common stock. We anticipate that we will continue to declare and pay dividends on our common stock quarterly.\nCash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive to GM Financial, loans to Automotive and Cruise from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax payments by GM Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.\nAutomotive Liquidity  \nTotal available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations. \nWe manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. Over 83% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2024. We have used, and will continue to use, other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n34\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers. \nIn March 2024, we renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility allocated for the exclusive use of GM Financial, which now matures March 27, 2025. Interest rates on obligations under the renewed credit facility are based on Term SOFR.\nIn March 2024, we terminated our unsecured 364-day delayed draw term loan credit agreement that permitted the Company to borrow up to $3.0 billion executed in November 2023, resulting in an insignificant loss.\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. Our Automotive borrowing capacity under credit facilities totaled $14.3 billion at December 31, 2024, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities, and $17.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which consisted primarily of three credit facilities. Total Automotive borrowing capacity under our credit facilities does not include our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use of GM Financial. We did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial continues to have access to our automotive credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against any of these facilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate. We did not have intercompany loans to GM Financial at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2024 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future. \nIn December 2024, we exercised the make-whole provision on a portion of our $2.0 billion senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of October 2025, redeeming $750 million in aggregate principal amount. Upon settlement in December 2024, we recorded an \ninsignificant\n early extinguishment of debt loss.\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends on its common stock of $1.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and $1.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio. \nThe following table summarizes our Automotive available liquidity (dollars in billions): \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAutomotive cash and cash equivalents\n$\n14.5 \n$\n12.2 \nMarketable debt securities\n7.3 \n7.6 \nAutomotive cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities\n21.7 \n19.8 \nAvailable under credit facilities(a)\n13.8 \n16.4 \nTotal Automotive available liquidity\n$\n35.5 \n$\n36.3 \n \n__________\n \n(a)\nWe had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our Automotive available liquidity (dollars in billions): \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nOperating cash flow\n$\n23.9 \nCapital expenditures\n(10.7)\nDividends paid and payments to purchase common stock\n(7.6)\nGM investment in Cruise\n(1.3)\nPayment of senior unsecured note\n(0.8)\nInvestment in Ultium Cells Holdings LLC\n(0.7)\nInvestment in Lithium Americas \n(0.3)\nOther non-operating\n(0.7)\nDecrease in available credit facilities\n(2.7)\nTotal change in automotive available liquidity\n$\n(0.8)\nAutomotive Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating Activities\nNet income\n$\n6.6 \n$\n10.1 \n$\n8.5 \n$\n(3.5)\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment charges\n6.5 \n6.8 \n6.3 \n(0.3)\nPension and OPEB activities\n(1.4)\n(1.0)\n(2.0)\n(0.4)\nWorking capital\n1.5 \n(0.4)\n0.5 \n1.9 \nAccrued and other liabilities and income taxes\n6.3 \n4.1 \n3.1 \n2.2 \nOther(a)\n4.4 \n1.2 \n2.7 \n3.2 \nNet automotive cash provided by (used in) operating activities(b)\n$\n23.9 \n$\n20.8 \n$\n19.1 \n$\n3.1 \n__________\n(a)\nIncludes $4.1 billion for the Automotive China JVs impairment and restructuring-related equity losses in the year ended December 31, 2024; $1.8 billion in dividends received from GM Financial in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and $1.7 billion in dividends received from GM Financial in the year ended December 31, 2022; partially offset by non-cash changes in other assets and liabilities.\n(b)\nIncludes $8.2 billion, $4.8 billion and $6.7 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The following table summarizes our credit ratings at January 16, 2025:\nCorporate\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nSenior Unsecured\nOutlook\nDBRS\nBBB (high)\nBBB (high)\nN/A\nStable\nFitch\nBBB\nBBB\nBBB\nPositive\nMoody's\nInvestment Grade\nBaa2\nBaa2\nStable\nS&P\nBBB\nBBB\nBBB\nStable\nFitch: Revised their outlook to Positive from Stable in October 2024.\nCruise Liquidity\n  Cruise available liquidity of $0.3 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents. In June 2024, Cruise issued to us a convertible note in the amount of $0.9 billion. This note is convertible into certain Cruise equity interests. At December 31, 2024, Cruise had total borrowings of $0.4 billion with GM \n37\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFinancial under a multi-year credit agreement to fund the purchase of AVs from GM. Cruise available liquidity also excludes a multi-year framework agreement with us whereby Cruise can defer payments until June 2028 on up to $0.8 billion of invoices, which are related to engineering and capital spending incurred by us on behalf of Cruise, and an agreement with us whereby Cruise can defer reimbursing us for amounts we paid related to its restructuring actions that commenced in October 2023. At December 31, 2024, Cruise deferred $1.3 billion under these agreements. In December 2024, GM announced it will no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market. Refer to Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Cruise's restructuring actions.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Cruise's available liquidity (dollars in billions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nOperating cash flow(a)\n$\n(2.2)\nGM investment in Cruise\n1.3 \nOther non-operating\n(0.1)\nTotal change in Cruise available liquidity\n$\n(1.0)\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes $0.1 billion cash outflows related to tendered Cruise Class B Common Shares classified as liabilities.\nCruise Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n(2.2)\n$\n(1.9)\n$\n(1.8)\n$\n(0.3)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities(a)\n$\n— \n$\n1.3 \n$\n— \n$\n(1.4)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities(b)\n$\n1.2 \n$\n0.4 \n$\n1.8 \n$\n0.8 \n__________\n \n(a)\nIncludes $1.4 billion of net proceeds from the liquidation of marketable securities in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n(b)\nIncludes $1.3 billion, $0.5 billion and $2.4 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 related to investments from GM which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFollowing the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests and subject to the approval of the Cruise Board of Directors, we expect that the plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving will significantly reduce Cruise's liquidity needs going forward.\nAutomotive Financing – GM Financial Liquidity  \nGM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases and funding of finance receivables and leased vehicles, repayment or repurchases of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, operating expenses, income taxes and dividend payments. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt between secured and unsecured debt. The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions):\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n5.1 \n$\n5.3 \nBorrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets\n21.5 \n21.9 \nBorrowing capacity on committed unsecured lines of credit\n0.7 \n0.7 \nBorrowing capacity on revolving credit facility, exclusive to GM Financial\n2.0 \n2.0 \nTotal GM Financial available liquidity\n$\n29.3 \n$\n29.9 \nGM Financial structures liquidity to support at least six months of GM Financial's expected net cash flows, including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity. At December 31, 2024, available liquidity exceeded GM Financial's liquidity targets.\n38\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGM Financial did not have any borrowings outstanding against our credit facility designated for their exclusive use or the remainder of our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to the \"Automotive Liquidity\" section of this MD&A for additional details.\nCredit Facilities  \nIn the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. At December 31, 2024, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $27.1 billion, $0.7 billion and $2.1 billion with advances outstanding of $5.4 billion, an insignificant amount and $2.1 billion.\nGM Financial Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n6.4 \n$\n6.7 \n$\n5.5 \n$\n(0.3)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities(a)\n$\n(15.4)\n$\n(10.9)\n$\n(10.0)\n$\n(4.5)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities(b)\n$\n8.9 \n$\n5.7 \n$\n4.0 \n$\n3.2 \n__________\n \n(a)\nIncludes $6.4 billion, $3.0 billion and $5.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for purchases of, and collections on, wholesale finance receivables from GM which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n(b)\nIncludes $1.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and $1.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022 for dividends to GM which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.  \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to an increase in interest paid, a net decrease in cash provided by counterparty derivative collateral posting activities and an increase in acquisition costs related to vehicle protection contracts, partially offset by an increase in finance charge income.\nCritical Accounting Estimates  \nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates. \nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns  \nThe estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models. \nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors. \nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate \n39\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nexperience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\nSales Incentives  \nThe estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by approximately $0.4 billion. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses \n The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.\nAt December 31, 2024, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the U.S. retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.1 billion. If the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $0.2 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of financing products for dealers and other businesses. GM Financial provides commercial lending products to its dealer customers th\nat include floorplan financing, also known as wholesale or inventory financing, which is lending to finance vehicle inventory. GM Financial also provides dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Additionally, GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain of our subsidiaries. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals  \nGM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At the inception of a lease, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from one to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. \nDuring the term of a lease, GM Financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation. \n40\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.  \nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2024, which could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\nImpact to Depreciation Expense\n2025\n$\n158 \n2026\n60 \n2027\n16 \n2028 and thereafter\n1 \nTotal\n$\n235 \nChanges to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. If a decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge. GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no material impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nPension and OPEB Plans  \nOur defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. \nIn December 2024, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result, the weighted-average long-term rate of Return on Assets (ROA) increased to 6.5% at December 31, 2024 from 6.3% at December 31, 2023. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.\nAnother key assumption in determining net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment. \nSignificant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in \n41\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nunamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $6.2 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The year-over-year change is primarily due to lower than expected asset returns partially offset by an increase in discount rates.\nThe funded status of the U.S. pension plans improved in the year ended December 31, 2024 to $1.8 billion underfunded status from $2.2 billion underfunded status primarily due to: (1) favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $1.4 billion; (2) contributions of $0.5 billion; and (3) favorable effect of actual return on plan assets of $0.5 billion; partially offset by (4) service and interest costs of $2.2 billion.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:\nU.S. Plans(a)\nNon-U.S. Plans(a)\nEffect on 2025 Pension  Expense\nEffect on December 31, 2024 PBO\nEffect on 2025 Pension  Expense\nEffect on December 31, 2024 PBO\n25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n-$50\n+$767\n-$4\n+$256\n25 basis point increase in discount rate\n+$47\n-$741\n+$7\n-$245\n25 basis point decrease in expected rate of ROA\n+$99\nN/A\n+$23\nN/A\n25 basis point increase in expected rate of ROA\n-$99\nN/A\n-$23\nN/A\n__________\n(a)\nThe sensitivity does not include the effects of the individual annual yield curve rates applied for the calculation of the service and interest cost.\nRefer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions, investment strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category. \nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets \n The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.\nAt December 31, 2024, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were $6.5 billion. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances.\nNon-GAAP Measures  \nWe use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. Our non-GAAP measures include: EBIT-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; EBT-adjusted for our GM Financial segment; EPS-diluted-adjusted; ETR-adjusted; ROIC-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures. \nThese non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors. \n42\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEBIT-adjusted\n (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net income attributable to stockholders)\n  EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. \nEPS-diluted-adjusted \n(Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share)\n \n \nEPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances. \nETR-adjusted \n(Most comparable GAAP measure: Effective tax rate)\n \n \nETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict. \nROIC-adjusted \n(Most comparable GAAP measure: Return on equity)\n  ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow \n(Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities)\n \n \nAdjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

These adjustments were excluded because significant impacts of valuation allowances are not considered part of our core operations. \n(d)\nThis adjustment consists of a return to (return from) the preferred shareholders related to the redemption of Cruise preferred shares from noncontrolling interest holders in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.\nThe following table reconciles our effective tax rate under U.S. GAAP to ETR-adjusted: \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome before income taxes\nIncome tax expense\nEffective tax rate\nIncome before income taxes\nIncome tax expense\nEffective tax rate\nIncome before income taxes\nIncome tax expense\nEffective tax rate\nEffective tax rate\n$\n8,519 \n$\n2,556 \n30.0 \n%\n$\n10,403 \n$\n563 \n5.4 \n%\n$\n11,597 \n$\n1,888 \n16.3 \n%\nAdjustments(a)\n6,564 \n477 \n1,916 \n504 \n2,221 \n423 \nTax adjustments(b)\n \n— \n870 \n482 \nETR-adjusted\n$\n15,083 \n$\n3,033 \n20.1 \n%\n$\n12,319 \n$\n1,937 \n15.7 \n%\n$\n13,818 \n$\n2,793 \n20.2 \n%\n__________\n(a)\nRefer to the reconciliation of Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. GAAP to EBIT-adjusted within this section of the MD&A for adjustment details.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about possible future events and are often identified by words like “aim,” “anticipate,” “appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “priorities,” “project,” “pursue,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “when,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions. In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, include, among others, the following: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer needs and preferences; (2) our ability to attract and retain talented and highly skilled employees; (3) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (4) our ability to profitably deliver a strategic portfolio of EVs; (5) our long-term strategy is dependent on consumer adoptions of EVs; (6) the success of our current line of ICE vehicles, particularly our full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (7) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of incentives, and the introduction of new and improved vehicle models by our competitors; (8) the unique technological, operational, regulatory and competitive risks related to our recently announced plans to refocus our AV strategy on personal vehicles; (9) risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, our transition to EVs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events; (10) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (11) inflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of raw materials and commodities used by us and our suppliers, and instability in logistics and related costs; (12) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (13) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships, particularly with respect to facilitating access to raw materials necessary for the production of EVs, and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (14) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which expose us to a variety of unique political, economic, competitive and regulatory risks, including the risk of changes in government leadership and laws (including labor, trade, tax and other laws), political uncertainty or instability and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, economic downturns in the countries in which we operate, differing local product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions, differing labor regulations, requirements and union relationships, differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships, difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries, and public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness; (15) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (16) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (17) pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises; (18) the possibility that competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, or that our intellectual property \n46\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nrights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (19) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles; (20) our ability to manage security breaches and other disruptions to our in-vehicle systems; (21) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the personal information of our customers, employees or suppliers; (22) our ability to comply with extensive laws, regulations and policies applicable to our operations and products, including those relating to fuel economy, emissions and AVs; (23) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (24) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (25) any additional tax expense or exposure or failure to fully realize available tax incentives; (26) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (27) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *",
