Our products are represented in nearly every commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers. We estimate that approximately 90% of our net sales for fiscal year 2025 were generated by proprietary products.\nMost of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue. Once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft, we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft, which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years. A typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years, giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years. We estimate that approximately 55% of our net sales in fiscal year 2025 were generated from the aftermarket, the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets. Historically, these aftermarket revenues have produced a higher gross profit and have been more stable than net sales to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).\n1\nTable of Contents\nOur business strategy is made up of two key strengths: (1) successful execution of our value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.\nValue-Driven Operating Strategy.\n Our three core value drivers are:\n•\nObtaining Profitable New Business.\n We attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. We have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and OEM products to drive our growth.\n•\nImproving Our Cost Structure.\n We are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.\n•\nProviding Highly Engineered Value-Added Products to Customers.\n We focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. We believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. This has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so.\nSelective Acquisition Strategy.\n We maintain a selective acquisition strategy, concentrating on proprietary commercial aerospace component businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to value creation through the application of our three core value drivers. The integration of acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements in the financial performance of the acquired businesses. Since the inception of our company in 1993, we have acquired 95 businesses and various product lines. Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for information on the recent acquisitions.\nProducts\nWe primarily design, produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components with significant aftermarket content. We seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers. We attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing highly engineered products with high quality, reliability and timely delivery. Our proprietary products, and particularly our new product initiatives, are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry. These proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements. Our portfolio of products encompasses a vast array of essential components that play pivotal roles on commercial aerospace and defense platforms, as well as other products. For example, TransDigm’s operating units make aircraft seatbelts and cockpit security systems that keep passengers and pilots safe; parachutes that protect military personnel; and specialized equipment for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (“NASA”) space telescopes, aiding in space exploration and scientific advancement.\nOur engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income. Research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to the total costs of research and development.\n2\nTable of Contents\nSegments\nThe Company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments: Power & Control, Airframe and Non-aviation.\nThe Power & Control segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic, fluid, power and mechanical motion control technologies. Major product offerings include mechanical/electromechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, databus and power controls, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, cargo loading, handling, delivery systems and electronic components used in the generation, amplification, transmission and reception of microwave signals. Primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.\nThe Airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that are used in non-power airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies. Major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology, parachutes, specialized flight, wind tunnel and jet engine testing services and equipment and complex testing and instrumentation solutions. Primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.\nThe Non-aviation segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market products for non-aviation markets. Major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications, mechanical/electromechanical actuators and controls for space applications, hydraulic/electromechanical actuators and fuel valves for land-based gas turbines, and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries and turbine controls for the energy and oil and gas markets. Primary customers of this segment are off-road vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers, child restraint system suppliers, satellite and space system suppliers, manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries and turbine original equipment manufacturers, gas pipeline builders and electric utilities.\nFor financial information about our segments, refer to Note 15, “Segments,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nCustomers\nWe predominantly serve customers in the commercial, regional, business jet and general aviation aftermarket, which generally account for 30% to 35% of our annual net sales; the commercial aerospace OEM market, comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers, which generally account for 25% to 30% of our annual net sales; and the defense market (which includes defense OEMs and aftermarket sales to the U.S. and friendly foreign governments), which generally account for approximately 35% to 40% of our annual net sales. \nOur customers include: (1) distributors of aerospace components; (2) worldwide commercial airlines, including national and regional airlines; (3) large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft OEMs; (4) various armed forces of the United States and friendly foreign governments; (5) defense OEMs; (6) system suppliers; and (7) various other industrial customers. Our top ten customers for fiscal year 2025 accounted for approximately 40% of our net sales. Products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms. None of our customers individually accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales for fiscal year 2025. We believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance.\nCompetition\nThe niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide. Due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry, competition in these categories comes from both U.S. and foreign companies. Competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately-held entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios.\n3\nTable of Contents\nWe compete on the basis of engineering, manufacturing and marketing high quality and reliable products, which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers, consistent and timely delivery, and superior customer service and support. The industry’s stringent regulatory, certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products. If customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards, we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process. In addition, we believe that the availability, dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue long-term supplier relationships.\nGovernmental Regulations\nThe commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) in the United States and by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in Europe and other agencies throughout the world, while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies, and, in many cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models.\nWe must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs and airlines that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations. In addition, the FAA and other aviation authorities require that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services. We also maintain several FAA-approved repair stations.\nIn addition, our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters. Without limiting the foregoing, sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses, including the disposal of hazardous wastes, are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws.\nRefer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business.\nRaw Materials\nWe require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes. We purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers. We also purchase replacement parts, which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations. At times, we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships. Most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have various trade secrets, proprietary information, trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, which we believe, in the aggregate but not individually, are important to our business. The Company's products are manufactured, marketed and sold using a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire in the future. The Company develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis. Based on the broad scope of the Company’s product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws. \nFor information regarding environmental reserves, refer to Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws during fiscal 2025 did not have a material impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or cash flows. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future. For further information on environmental-related risks, including climate change, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\n4\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had approximately 16,500 full-time, part-time and temporary employees. Approximately 15% of our full-time and part-time employees are represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates up to January 2029. \nWe consider our employees to be our greatest asset. Succession planning and the development, attraction and retention of employees is critical for TransDigm and its operating units to sustain our three core value drivers (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers).   \nWe have established development programs such as TransDigm University to empower internal career progression support the advancement of our employees. We also have established recruiting programs to identify and hire new talent such as the Management Development Program (“MDP”), which involved the recruiting of recent masters program graduates at certain colleges and universities, and the Junior Military Officer (“JMO”) Program, which involves the recruiting of U.S. military veterans.\nTransDigm’s executive team also mentors rising talent on a more informal basis. This informal mentorship achieves a number of goals, including accelerating the development of top performers, fosters organizational learning, enhances employee performance and contributes to our retention efforts. The executive team dedicates substantial time to assessing our pool of future leaders, ensuring that we have the people and skills necessary to continue driving our business forward. \nWe offer attractive benefits packages that attract, retain, motivate and reward our talent, and we are committed to providing our employees and their families with programs that support their health and overall well-being. To empower our employees financially, we provide retirement savings plans and opportunities for tax-free savings through flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. We believe that our compensation programs, including base pay, bonus structures and equity programs, fairly reward our employees for their hard work. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining a work-life balance, which is why our employees receive paid time off and enjoy designated holidays. \nWe understand the value in furthering the knowledge and education of our current employee base. In addition to formal and informal employee development programs within TransDigm and our operating units, employees can expand their careers by accessing tuition reimbursement programs. Some operating units also partner with local colleges to provide training courses to TransDigm employees. Access to programs such as these enhance our employees’ value to the Company, our customers and our communities. \nAt TransDigm, we highly value the contributions of diverse perspectives, fresh ideas and varied experiences. Our commitment to diversity and inclusiveness is more than just an organizational goal; it is a fundamental principle that drives innovation, enhances our competitive edge and ultimately leads to better outcomes for all stakeholders. To gauge our progress, we annually review and assess our diversity initiatives and metrics. \nDiscrimination is not tolerated at TransDigm. We are committed to high ethical standards and equal employment opportunities in all personnel actions without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, citizenship status, age, marital status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.\nWe are focused on establishing, maintaining and operating our facilities, with a strong emphasis on process safety and risk mitigation. Equally, we strive to empower and support our employees in preventing accidents and promoting a healthy work environment. We require our personnel to report and communicate risks, potential hazards, incidents and near misses so that we can investigate and establish appropriate measures to prevent future occurrences. To underscore our commitment to employee safety and well-being, we require each operating unit to individually report environmental, health and safety matters to our executive team monthly.\nSeasonality\nWe do not believe our net sales are subject to significant seasonal variation; however, our net sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year compared to the subsequent quarters due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays. \nAvailable Information\nTD Group’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, including any amendments, will be made available free of charge on the Company’s website, \nwww.transdigm.com\n, as soon as reasonably practicable, following the filing of the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with TD Group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.\nOverview\nWe believe we are a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered proprietary aerospace components with significant aftermarket content. We seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers. We attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering, service and manufacturing capabilities. We believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality, reliability and strong customer support. We believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance we believe that due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure via productivity and cost improvements and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long-term.\nOur selective acquisition strategy has also been an important contribution to the growth of our business. We maintain a selective acquisition strategy, concentrating on proprietary commercial aerospace component businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to value creation through the application of our three core value drivers. The integration of acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements in the financial performance of the acquired businesses.\nFor fiscal year 2025, we generated net sales of $8,831 million, gross profit of $5,311 million or 60.1% of net sales, and net income attributable to TD Group of $2,074 million. \nIn fiscal 2025, demand for air travel remained strong both domestically and internationally. Commercial aftermarket sales increased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to the overall demand for air travel resulting in higher flight hours and utilization of passenger and freight aircraft as global air traffic continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. In recent months, international air traffic growth has been outpacing domestic growth. Passenger load factors remain strong and have reached record levels in recent months in certain markets.\nOur commercial transport OEM shipments and revenues generally run ahead of aircraft delivery schedules. Consistent with prior years, our fiscal 2025 shipments were a function of, among other things, the estimated 2025 and 2026 commercial aircraft production rates for Boeing and Airbus. Airline demand for new aircraft remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels as the struggles in the OEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, along with geopolitical challenges, though progress continues to be made in the build rates. Airbus has also encountered difficulties in ramping up production. For fiscal 2025, the impact across TransDigm's operating units was uneven and varied, resulting in consolidated commercial OEM sales decreasing compared to fiscal 2024.   \nOur defense business fluctuates from year-to-year, and is dependent, to a degree, on government budget constraints, the timing of orders, macro and micro dynamics with respect to the DOD procurement policy and the extent of global conflicts, such as the ongoing geopolitical conflicts. Likewise, delays in government spending outlays and government funding reprioritization can impact demand. For a variety of reasons, the military spending outlook is very uncertain, though recent DOD budgets have trended upwards due to recent geopolitical challenge and conflicts, and current military modernization efforts. Defense sales in fiscal 2025 increased compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to continued U.S. Government defense spend outlays.\nAt various points in 2025, the U.S. Government announced new or higher tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from numerous countries resulting in multiple countries countering with reciprocal tariffs and other actions in response. Negotiations between the U.S. and other countries regarding the tariffs are ongoing and their status continues to evolve. TransDigm is primarily a domestic manufacturer. Because of this, tariffs did not have a significant impact on our fiscal 2025 operating results and we do not expect the tariffs to have a significant impact on our fiscal 2026 operating results. However, we continue to monitor the developments on tariffs and other changes in trade policy for its potential impact on the economic environment and on our business and operating results.\n18\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data of the Company, including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales (amounts in millions, except per share data): \nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2025\n% of Net Sales\n2024\n% of Net Sales\nNet sales\n$\n8,831 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n7,940 \n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales\n3,520 \n39.9 \n%\n3,268 \n41.2 \n%\nSelling and administrative expenses\n945 \n10.7 \n%\n980 \n12.3 \n%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n201 \n2.3 \n%\n161 \n2.0 \n%\nIncome from operations\n4,165 \n47.2 \n%\n3,531 \n44.5 \n%\nInterest expense-net\n1,572 \n17.8 \n%\n1,286 \n16.2 \n%\nRefinancing costs\n11 \n0.1 \n%\n58 \n0.7 \n%\nOther income\n(47)\n(0.5)\n%\n(28)\n(0.4)\n%\nIncome tax provision\n555 \n6.3 \n%\n500 \n6.3 \n%\nIncome from continuing operations\n2,074 \n23.5 \n%\n1,715 \n21.6 \n%\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n— \n— \n%\n(1)\n— \n%\nNet income attributable to TD Group\n$\n2,074 \n23.5 \n%\n$\n1,714 \n21.6 \n%\nNet income applicable to TD Group common stockholders\n$\n1,866 \n(1)\n21.1 \n%\n$\n1,481 \n(1)\n18.7 \n%\nEarnings per share attributable to TD Group common stockholders:\nBasic and diluted\n$\n32.08\n(2)\n$\n25.62\n(2)\nCash dividends declared per common share\n$\n90.00\n$\n110.00\nWeighted-average shares outstanding—basic and diluted\n58.2 \n57.8 \nOther Data:\nEBITDA\n$\n4,568 \n(3)\n$\n3,813 \n(3)\nEBITDA As Defined\n$\n4,760 \n(3)\n53.9 \n%\n$\n4,173 \n(3)\n52.6 \n%\n \n(1)\nNet income applicable to TD Group common stockholders represents net income attributable to TD Group less special dividends declared or paid on participating securities, including dividend equivalents of $208 million and $233 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(2)\nEarnings per share is calculated by dividing net income applicable to TD Group common stockholders by the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.

Acquisition sales represent net sales from acquired businesses for the period up to one year from the respective acquisition date. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for information on the Company's recent acquisitions.  \nThe increase in organic sales of $615 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to increases in defense and commercial aftermarket. \n•\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit\n.\n Cost of sales increased by $252 million or 7.7%, to $3,520 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 compared to $3,268 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. Cost of sales and the related percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows (amounts in millions): \nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n% Change\nCost of sales - excluding costs below\n$\n3,536 \n$\n3,241 \n$\n295 \n9.1 \n%\n% of net sales\n40.0 \n%\n40.8 \n%\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense\n15 \n21 \n(6)\n(28.6)\n%\n% of net sales\n0.2 \n%\n0.3 \n%\nInventory step-up amortization\n10 \n21 \n(11)\n(52.4)\n%\n% of net sales\n0.1 \n%\n0.3 \n%\nForeign currency losses\n10 \n20 \n(10)\n(50.0)\n%\n% of net sales\n0.1 \n%\n0.3 \n%\nLoss contract amortization\n(51)\n(35)\n(16)\n(45.7)\n%\n% of net sales\n(0.6)\n%\n(0.4)\n%\nTotal cost of sales\n$\n3,520 \n$\n3,268 \n$\n252 \n7.7 \n%\n% of net sales\n39.9 \n%\n41.2 \n%\nGross profit (Net sales less Total cost of sales)\n$\n5,311 \n$\n4,672 \n$\n639 \n13.7 \n%\nGross profit percentage (Gross profit / Net sales)\n60.1 \n%\n58.8 \n%\nCost of sales during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 decreased as a percentage of net sales. This was primarily driven by the application of our three core value-driven operating strategy (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers) coupled with fixed overhead costs spread over higher production volume.\nForeign exchange rates continue to fluctuate; the loss is primarily attributable to the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar. Loss contract amortization fluctuates primarily based on the rate of actual to forecasted shipments of the products covered under the onerous contract.\n20\nTable of Contents\n•\nSelling and Administrative Expenses.\n Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $35 million to $945 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025. The related percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows (amounts in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n% Change\nSelling and administrative expenses - excluding costs below\n$\n779 \n$\n738 \n$\n41 \n5.6 \n%\n% of net sales\n8.8 \n%\n9.3 \n%\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense\n142 \n196 \n(54)\n(27.6)\n%\n% of net sales\n1.6 \n%\n2.5 \n%\nAcquisition transaction and integration-related expenses\n24 \n46 \n(22)\n(47.8)\n%\n% of net sales\n0.3 \n%\n0.6 \n%\nTotal selling and administrative expenses\n$\n945 \n$\n980 \n$\n(35)\n(3.6)\n%\n% of net sales\n10.7 \n%\n12.3 \n%\nThe decrease in non-cash stock and deferred compensation expense is primarily attributable to the appreciation of the stock price at a higher rate in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2025, as the stock price is a key input used to determine the Black-Scholes fair value for the non-cash stock compensation expense, and lower deferred compensation expense. \n•\nInterest Expense-net.\n Interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount, revolving credit facility fees, finance leases, interest income and the impact of interest rate swaps, caps and collars designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges. Interest expense-net increased $286 million, or 22.2%, to $1,572 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 from $1,286 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in outstanding borrowings (refer to Note 10, “Debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on our debt) and a decrease in interest income. The weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding was 6.3% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024. \n•\nIncome Tax Provision.\n Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 21.1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 compared to 22.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.

Below is further information on the significant debt financing transactions occurring in fiscal 2025: \n•\nOn May 20, 2025, the Company completed the issuance of $2,650 million in 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2033 (the “6.375% 2033 Notes”), which the net proceeds of approximately $2,615 million, along with existing cash on hand, were used to redeem all of its outstanding $2,650 million in 5.500% senior subordinated notes due 2027 (the “5.500% 2027 Notes”). The redemption occurred on June 20, 2025. \n•\nOn July 11, 2025, the Company amended its Securitization Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the borrowing capacity from $650 million to $725 million; and (ii) extend the maturity date to July 10, 2026 at an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 1.35% compared to an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 1.45% that applied prior to the amendment. Prior to the amendment, the Securitization Facility was fully drawn. As of September 30, 2025, the Securitization Facility was fully drawn as the remaining $75 million available was drawn in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n•\nOn August 19, 2025, the Company completed $5,000 million in new debt issuances. The new debt was comprised of the following: (i) $500 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2034 in a private offering at an issue price of 100% that bear interest at a rate of 6.250% (the “2034 Secured Notes”); (ii) $2,000 million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2034 at an issue price of 100% that bear interest at a rate of 6.750% (the “6.750% 2034 Notes”); and (iii) $2,500 million of Tranche M term loans that bear interest at a rate of Term SOFR plus 2.50%. Original issue discount of 0.25%, or approximately $6 million, was paid to the lenders of the Tranche M term loans. The proceeds from the August 19, 2025 new debt issuances were used, along with existing cash on hand, to fund a $90.00 special dividend declaration on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on eligible vested options outstanding under its stock option plans further described below.\n•\nOn September 17, 2025, the Company (i) repriced all of its $1,686 million in existing Tranche K term loans to bear interest at Term SOFR plus 2.25% compared to Term SOFR plus 2.75% applicable prior to the transaction; and (ii) amended and extended $1,857 million in existing Tranche I term loans maturing August 24, 2028 and converted such loans into new Tranche K term loans maturing March 22, 2030 (collectively, the “Tranche K term loans” referred to herein are comprised of the existing Tranche K term loans and new Tranche K term loans as described above).  \nAcquisitions\nDuring fiscal 2025, the Company completed approximately $413 million in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, including the acquisition of Servotronics, Inc. (“Servotronics”) completed on July 1, 2025 via a tender offer for approximately $133 million in cash. All fiscal 2025 acquisitions were financed using existing cash on hand.  \nOn October 6, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of the Simmonds Precision Products, Inc. Business (“Simmonds”) of Goodrich Corporation from RTX Corporation for approximately $757 million in cash. The acquisition was financed using existing cash on hand. The definitive agreement to acquire Simmonds was previously signed on June 30, 2025.  \n23\nTable of Contents\nSpecial Dividends\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $75.00 per outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on eligible vested options outstanding under its stock option plans, which was authorized and declared in September 2024 (fiscal 2024). The total cash payment in October 2024 (fiscal 2025) of special dividend and dividend equivalents from this declaration, which was funded by a combination of (i) $3,000 million in new senior secured debt issued on September 19, 2024; and (ii) existing cash on hand, was approximately $4,216 million in special dividends and $132 million in cash dividend equivalent payments. \nOn August 20, 2025, \nthe Company's Board of Directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of $90.00 per outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on eligible vested options outstanding under its stock option plans. The total cash payment in September 2025 of special dividend and dividend equivalents from this declaration, which was funded by a combination of (i) $5,000 million in new senior secured and unsecured debt issued on August 19, 2025 (as noted above); and (ii) existing cash on hand, was approximately $5,073 million in special dividends and $159 million in cash dividend equivalent payments.\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nAt various points in fiscal 2025, the Company repurchased, in aggregate, 401,036 shares of common stock at an average price of $1,246.71 per share for a total amount of $500 million. \nIn October 2025, the Company repurchased\n \n79,959 shares of common stock at an average price of $1,249.90 per share for a total amount of $100 million. Whether the Company undertakes additional share repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nIn November 2025, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $5,000 million in share repurchases of common stock permissible under the Company’s existing stock repurchase program, subject to any restrictions specified in the Credit Agreement and indentures governing the existing Subordinated and Secured Notes.\n* * * * * \nIf the Company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt.\nThe Company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the Company’s indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the Company’s ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control.\nThe Company's objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75% fixed rate and 25% variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. Interest rate swaps, caps and collars used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on our term loans are further described in Note 18, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. \nAs of September 30, 2025, approximately 75% of our gross debt was fixed rate.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company has significant cash liquidity as illustrated in the table presented below (in millions): \nAs of September 30, 2025\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,808 \nAvailability on revolving credit facility\n857 \nCash liquidity\n$\n3,665 \nWe believe our significant cash liquidity will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements. We expect to meet our short-term cash liquidity requirements (including interest obligations and capital expenditures) through net cash from operating activities, cash on hand and, if needed, draws on the revolving credit facility. Long-term cash liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt agreements. There is no maturity on any tranche of term loans or notes until August 2028 (fiscal 2028).\nThe Company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026 to be approximately 2.50% to 3.25% of net sales. The Company’s capital expenditures incurred from year-to-year are funded using existing cash on hand and are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core value-driven operating strategy (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers) such as automation projects.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategy, we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs. We believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business acquisitions, pay dividends to our shareholders and make opportunistic investments in our own stock, subject to any restrictions in our existing Credit Agreement and market conditions.  \nThe Company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so. In addition, the Company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for common stock repurchases or dividends. Our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets. \nOperating Activities\n. The Company generated $2,038 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2025 compared to $2,045 million during fiscal 2024.\nThe change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2025 was a use of cash of $212 million compared to a use of cash of $84 million in fiscal 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue. The Company actively manages its accounts receivable, the related agings and collection efforts.\nThe change in inventories during fiscal 2025 was a use of cash of $156 million compared to a use of cash of $104 million in fiscal 2024. The increase is due to an increase in raw materials to support the fiscal 2026 sales demand. The Company manages inventory levels in support of customer needs.\nThe change in accounts payable during fiscal 2025 was a source of cash of $38 million compared to a use of cash of $11 million in fiscal 2024. The change is due to the timing of payments to suppliers.\nInvesting Activities.\n Net cash used in investing activities was $595 million during fiscal 2025, consisting of $419 million from the acquisition of Servotronics and other acquisitions of businesses completed during fiscal 2025 and capital expenditures of $222 million; partially offset by other investing transactions, net, of $46 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,441 million during fiscal 2024, consisting of $2,347 million from the acquisitions of Raptor Scientific, the Electron Device Business of Communications & Power Industries (“CPI's Electron Device Business”) and other acquisitions of businesses completed during fiscal 2024 and capital expenditures of $165 million; partially offset by other investing transactions, net, of $71 million. \nFinancing Activities\n. Net cash used in financing activities was $4,900 million during fiscal 2025. The use of cash was primarily attributable to special dividend and dividend equivalent payments of $9,629 million plus repurchases of common stock of $500 million; partially offset by the net proceeds of short-term and long-term debt, including fees, of $5,063 million plus proceeds from stock option exercises of $166 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3,171 million during fiscal 2024. The source of cash was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of short-term and long-term debt, including fees, of $4,965 million plus proceeds from stock option exercises of $245 million; partially offset by special dividend and dividend equivalent payments of $2,038 million.\nDescription of Senior Secured Term Loans and Indentures\nSenior Secured Term Loans Facility\nTransDigm has $11,124 million in fully drawn term loans under the Term Loans Facility as of September 30, 2025 and a $910 million revolving credit facility. The Term Loans Facility consists of four tranches of term loans (refer to Note 10, “Debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on our term loans). \nThe Term Loans Facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of approximately $28 million. The revolving commitments consist of two tranches which include up to $139 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. At September 30, 2025, the Company had $53 million in letters of credit outstanding and $857 million in borrowings available under the revolving commitments. Draws on the revolving commitments are subject to an interest rate of 2.25%. The unused portion of the revolving commitments is subject to a fee of 0.50% per annum. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is February 27, 2029.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the Term Loans Facility under the Credit Agreement are, at TransDigm’s option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted Term SOFR for one, three or six-month interest periods chosen by TransDigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The adjusted Term SOFR related to the Term Loans Facility are not subject to a floor.

The most recent amendment that impacted the restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Agreement is Amendment No. 15, executed on March 22, 2024.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, TransDigm is entitled, on one or more occasions, to request additional term loans or additional revolving commitments to the extent that the existing or new lenders agree to provide such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments provided that, among other conditions, our consolidated net leverage ratio would be no greater than 7.25x and the consolidated secured net debt ratio would be no greater than 5.00x, in each case, after giving effect to such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments.\nIf any such default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the holders of the Subordinated Notes and Secured Notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Credit Agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder and the holders of the Secured Notes will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes.\nWith the exception of the revolving credit facility, the Company has no maintenance covenants in its existing term loan and indenture agreements. Under the Credit Agreement, if the usage of the revolving credit facility exceeds 40% (or, currently, $364 million) of the total revolving commitments, the Company is required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt to trailing four-quarter EBITDA As Defined of 7.50x (or, solely with respect to the first four fiscal quarters ending after the consummation of any material acquisition, 8.00x) as of the last day of the fiscal quarter.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in subsequent periods. \n27\nTable of Contents\nTrade Receivable Securitization Facility\nThe Company’s Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company’s borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations’ trade accounts receivable. The Securitization Facility includes the right for the Company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. The Company uses the proceeds from the Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs. \nOn July 11, 2025, the Company amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the borrowing capacity from $650 million to $725 million; and (ii) extend the maturity date to July 10, 2026 at an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 1.35% compared to an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 1.45% that applied prior to the amendment. Prior to the amendment, the Securitization Facility was fully drawn.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Securitization Facility was fully drawn as the remaining $75 million available was drawn in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. At September 30, 2025, the applicable interest rate was 5.67%. The Securitization Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s domestic operations’ trade accounts receivable. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s cash requirements from all significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2025 (in millions):\nTotal\nPayment Due by Period\nContractual\nLess than\nBetween\nBetween\nOver\nObligations\n1 Year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\n5 Years\nSenior Subordinated and Secured Notes \n(1)\n$\n18,100 \n$\n— \n$\n2,100 \n$\n4,700 \n$\n11,300 \nTerm Loans Facility \n(2)\n11,124 \n112 \n224 \n3,590 \n7,198 \nScheduled interest payments \n(3)\n10,144 \n1,865 \n3,531 \n2,761 \n1,987 \nSecuritization Facility\n725 \n725 \n— \n— \n— \nFinance leases\n562 \n22\n51\n52\n437\nOperating leases\n81 \n19\n28\n14\n20\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n$\n40,736 \n$\n2,743 \n$\n5,934 \n$\n11,117 \n$\n20,942 \n \n(1)\nRepresents principal maturities which excludes interest, debt issuance costs and original issue discount.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 10, “Debt,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for information on the maturity date of each tranche of term loans. The Term Loans Facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of approximately $28 million.\n(3)\nAssumes that the variable interest rate on our existing term loans under our Term Loans Facility ranges from approximately 5.50% to 6.75% based on anticipated movements in Term SOFR, which given the ongoing volatility in rates, are highly uncertain. In addition, interest payments include the impact of the existing interest rate swap and collar agreements described in Note 18, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations. Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $53 million in letters of credit outstanding.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nBelow are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional significant accounting policies, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\n28\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition \n– The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using the five step model prescribed in ASC 606. A substantial portion of the Company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. Revenue is recognized from the sale of products or services when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of promised goods or services have transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration the Company expects to be paid in exchange for goods or services. In a limited number of contracts, control transfers to the customer over time, primarily in contracts where the customer is required to pay for the cost of both the finished and unfinished goods at the time of cancellation plus a reasonable profit relative to the work performed for products that were customized for the customer. Therefore, we recognize revenue over time for those agreements that have a right to margin and where the products being produced have no alternative use. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n– In accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. We determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Fair value adjustments to the Company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition.\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Company’s intent to do so. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.\nU.S. GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, goodwill impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units have been identified at the operating unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.\nCompanies may perform a qualitative assessment as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment testing process for all or selected reporting units. Companies are also allowed to bypass the qualitative analysis and perform a quantitative analysis if desired. Economic uncertainties and the length of time from the calculation of a baseline fair value are factors that we consider in determining whether to perform a quantitative test.\nWhen we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment using a qualitative assessment, we consider factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test. For the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit is recognized. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used, inclusive of company-specific risk factors. The Company utilizes a third party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the WACC. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.\n29\nTable of Contents\nManagement, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. \nThe impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. Management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the WACC methodology, inclusive of considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts. Management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.\nThe discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.\nAs of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the date of the annual impairment test, no indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill was determined to be impaired. As economic and market conditions have not changed significantly since the first day of the fourth quarter, this conclusion remains appropriate as of September 30, 2025.\nIncome Taxes \n– The Company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. Historically, such adjustments have not been significant.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\n30\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present below certain financial information based on our EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined. References to “EBITDA” mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to “EBITDA As Defined” mean EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined presented below.\nNeither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. We present EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined because we believe they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity.\nOur management believes that EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities analysts, investors, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company’s ability to incur and service debt. In addition, EBITDA As Defined is useful to investors because the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility requires compliance under certain circumstances, on a pro forma basis, with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our Consolidated EBITDA defined in the same manner as we define EBITDA As Defined herein.\nIn addition to the above, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections. Moreover, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions.\nAlthough we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n•\nneither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;\n•\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;\n•\nthe omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;\n•\nneither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and\n•\nEBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA or EBITDA As Defined in isolation and specifically by using other U.S. GAAP measures, such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet Income\n$\n2,074 \n$\n1,715 \nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n367 \n312 \nInterest expense-net\n1,572 \n1,286 \nIncome tax provision\n555 \n500 \nEBITDA\n4,568 \n3,813 \nAdjustments:\nAcquisition transaction and integration-related expenses \n(1)\n42 \n70 \nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense \n(2)\n157 \n217 \nRefinancing costs \n(3)\n11 \n58 \nOther, net \n(4)\n(18)\n15 \nEBITDA As Defined\n$\n4,760 \n$\n4,173 \n \n(1)\nRepresents costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations; facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction and valuation-related costs for acquisitions comprising deal fees, legal, financial and tax due diligence expenses; and amortization expense of inventory step-up recorded in connection with the purchase accounting of acquired businesses.\n(2)\nRepresents the compensation expense recognized under our stock option plans and deferred compensation plans.\n(3)\nRepresents costs expensed related to debt financing activities, including new issuances, extinguishments, refinancings and amendments to existing agreements.\n(4)\nPrimarily represents foreign currency transaction gains or losses, payroll withholding taxes related to dividend equivalent payments and stock option exercises, non-service related pension costs, deferred compensation payments and other miscellaneous income or expense, such as gain on sale of business.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined  (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,038 \n$\n2,045 \nAdjustments:\nChanges in assets and liabilities, net of effects from acquisitions and sales of businesses\n558 \n302 \nInterest expense-net \n(1)\n1,534 \n1,246 \nIncome tax provision-current\n565 \n490 \nAmortization of inventory step-up\n(10)\n(21)\nLoss contract amortization\n51 \n35 \nRefinancing costs \n(2)\n(11)\n(58)\nGain on sale of businesses, net\n10 \n11 \nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense \n(3)\n(157)\n(217)\nForeign currency exchange losses\n(10)\n(20)\nEBITDA\n4,568 \n3,813 \nAdjustments:\nAcquisition transaction and integration-related expenses \n(4)\n42 \n70 \nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense \n(3)\n157 \n217 \nRefinancing costs \n(2)\n11 \n58 \nOther, net \n(5)\n(18)\n15 \nEBITDA As Defined\n$\n4,760 \n$\n4,173 \n \n(1)\nRepresents interest expense, net of interest income, excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on debt.\n(2)\nRepresents costs expensed related to debt financing activities, including new issuances, extinguishments, refinancings and amendments to existing agreements.\n(3)\nRepresents the compensation expense recognized under our stock option plans and deferred compensation plans.\n(4)\nRepresents costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations; facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction and valuation-related costs for acquisitions comprising deal fees, legal, financial and tax due diligence expenses; and amortization expense of inventory step-up recorded in connection with the purchase accounting of acquired businesses.\n(5)\nPrimarily represents foreign currency transaction gains or losses, payroll withholding taxes related to dividend equivalent payments and stock option exercises, non-service related pension costs, deferred compensation payments and other miscellaneous income or expense, such as gain on sale of business.\n33\nTable of Contents",
