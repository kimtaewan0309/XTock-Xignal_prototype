We provide advanced process control and process-enabling solutions for manufacturing wafers, reticles/masks, chemicals/materials, integrated circuits (“IC” or “chip”), packaged ICs and printed circuit boards (“PCB”), as well as comprehensive support and services across our installed base. Our suite of advanced products, coupled with our unique process control software and services, allow us to deliver the solutions our customers need to achieve their technology advancement and high-volume production goals by significantly improving yields, while simultaneously reducing waste, risks and costs. This improves our customers’ overall profitability and return on investment. Our services business, which accounted for approximately 22% of our revenue in fiscal 2025, increases the value of our contract offerings and promotes the extension of system lifetimes.\nKLA was formed as KLA-Tencor Corporation in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments Corporation and Tencor Instruments, two long-time leaders in the semiconductor capital equipment industry that began operations in 1975 and 1976, respectively. We are organized into three reportable segments: Semiconductor Process Control; Specialty Semiconductor Process; and PCB and Component Inspection. \nWithin the Semiconductor Process Control segment, our comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and software products, as well as related services, help IC, wafer, reticle/mask and chemical/materials manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the entire fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production. These products and services are designed to provide comprehensive solutions to help customers accelerate development and production ramp cycles, achieve higher and more stable product yields and improve their overall profitability.\nWithin the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, we develop and sell advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools, which are used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers, including manufacturers of microelectromechanical systems (“MEMS”), radio frequency (“RF”) communication semiconductors, and power semiconductors for automotive and industrial applications.\nWithin the PCB and Component Inspection segment, we enable electronic device manufacturers to inspect, test and measure PCBs, IC substrates and packaged ICs to verify their quality, pattern the desired electronic circuitry on the relevant substrate and perform three-dimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces.\nAdditional information about KLA is available at www.kla.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC. Additionally, these filings may be obtained through the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov), which contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.\nInvestors and others should note that we may announce material financial information to investors using our investor relations website (ir.kla.com), which includes our SEC filings, press releases, public earnings calls and conference webcasts. The investor relations website is used to communicate with the public about us and our products, services and other matters. \nIndustry\nOur core focus is enabling technological advances and improving manufacturing yields in the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer - a round disk typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter, about as thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is highly sophisticated and involves the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers. Prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish. Other, more specialized wafers, such as epitaxial silicon (“epi”), silicon on insulator (“SOI”), gallium nitride (“GaN”) and silicon carbide (“SiC”) are also used in the semiconductor industry.\nThe manufacturing cycle of an IC is grouped into three phases: design, fabrication and testing. IC design involves the architectural layout of the circuit, as well as design verification and reticle generation. The fabrication of a semiconductor chip (or “semiconductor”) is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or insulators \n1\nTable of Contents\non bare wafers. The deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps, many performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors, which performs the “smart” functions; and the upper “interconnect” structure, typically consisting of circuitry, which connects the components in the lower structure. When the layers on the wafer have been fabricated, each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality. The wafer is then cut into individual chips, and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged. Final testing is performed on all packaged chips. Packaged chips are then mounted onto PCBs for connection to the rest of the electronic system.\nOur business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers. This is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ICs, products utilizing ICs and other electronic components. We do not consider our business to be seasonal. Still, our business has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor or other industries in which we operate, slowdowns in the worldwide economy, customer consolidation as well as recent political and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.\nCompanies anticipating future market demands by developing and advancing new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance devices are critical goals of modern semiconductor and related electronics manufacturing. Ramping to high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase IC manufacturers’ revenue and profit for a given product. Leading semiconductor manufacturers invest in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies, some requiring new substrate and film materials, new geometries, new transistor architectures, new power distribution schemes, advanced multi-patterning optical and extreme ultraviolet (“EUV”) lithography, and advanced packaging techniques. As design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects. Device performance characteristics (namely speed, capacity or power management) also become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation. New process materials require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face. The continuing evolution of semiconductors to smaller geometries and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced IC fabrication facility today can cost well above $10 billion, substantially more than previous-generation facilities. In addition, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment.\nThe semiconductor capital equipment industry has been experiencing multiple growth drivers bolstered by demand for semiconductors from leading-edge foundry and logic manufacturers to support computational power and connectivity and continued investment by our customers in legacy nodes. Adoption of EUV in high volume manufacturing (“HVM”) for Logic and DRAM memory is driving new process control requirements and growth in key markets for KLA. Demand for advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly evident in the 2-nanometer node, which is seeing higher levels of investment and process control intensity, continues to drive investments in AI. Increasing complexity and value of semiconductor packages, particularly for AI and High-performance computing (“HPC”) applications, is also driving significant growth in the advanced packaging business. The digitization of all industries, including 5G markets and advances in healthcare and industrial applications, together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles, are powering leading-edge design node technology investments and capacity expansions. \nRegionalization of semiconductors has become a trend as access to semiconductors is viewed from the lens of national security. China remains as a major region for the manufacturing of legacy node logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. The Chinese government initiatives around self-sustainability are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector, Commerce has added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List (a list of parties that are generally ineligible to receive U.S. regulated items without prior licensing from Commerce), restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license. In addition, Commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses. It also requires our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List.\n2\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nThe market for semiconductor and electronics industries is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. These technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. We make significant investments in product R&D for the timely development of new products and enhancements necessary to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to R&D programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs.\nOur key R&D activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 involved the development of process control and process-enabling solutions for front end semiconductors and advanced packaging. Our primary R&D centers are located in the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”), India, China, Singapore and Israel. For information regarding our R&D expenses during the last three fiscal years, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is primarily due to our leading technology, which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product R&D. Even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry, we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development to enhance our competitive position.\nCustomers\nWe count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for our equipment. Our business depends on capital expenditures from these manufacturers which, in turn, depend on many factors including general economic conditions, anticipated market demand, evolving government regulations and capacity constraints. Our ability to compete in this area depends upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the U.S., and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region. \nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, primarily in the Semiconductor Process Control segment:\nFiscal Year Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSales, Service and Marketing\nOur sales, service and marketing efforts aim to build deep long-term relationships with our customers. We focus on providing comprehensive resources for the full breadth of process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions for manufacturing and testing wafers and reticles, a wide variety of ICs, PCBs, IC substrates and packaging as well as general materials research. Our revenues are derived primarily from product sales and related service contracts, mostly through our direct sales force.\nWe believe that the size and location of our field sales, service engineering, applications engineering, and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets. We have direct sales forces in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. We maintain an export compliance program designed to meet the requirements of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State and the trade regulations of the international jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn addition to sales and service offices in the U.S., we conduct sales, marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in many regions; some of the largest include China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the U.K. We believe sales outside the U.S. will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. International revenues accounted for approximately 89% of our total revenues in both of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 and 88% of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 18 “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInternational sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on \n3\nTable of Contents\nexport technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in non-U.S. dollar product sales through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. These factors, as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in Item 1A “Risk Factors,” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.\nProducts and Services\nKLA develops industry-leading process control and yield management solutions and services that enable innovation throughout the semiconductor and related electronics industries. We provide advanced process control and process-enabling solutions for manufacturing wafers, reticles, ICs, packaging, PCBs and IC substrates. In March 2024, we made the decision to exit our business of manufacturing flat and flexible panel displays (“Display”) by announcing the end of manufacturing of most Display products, but we will continue to provide services to the installed base of Display products for existing customers.\nThe Semiconductor Process Control segment offers a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology, chemistry process control and software products and related services, which support the semiconductor ecosystem from R&D to final volume production. For IC manufacturing, our systems support the production of all chip types including advanced logic, DRAM, 3D NAND, power devices, MEMS, legacy design node chips and more. Our substrate manufacturing systems support the production of a broad range of wafer types and sizes including silicon, prime silicon SOI, sapphire, glass, wide bandgap substrates (e.g., SiC, GaN) and more. Our reticle systems support quality control during the manufacturing of optical and EUV reticle types. We also make products that support chemical/materials quality control, and process tool development and qualification.

Whether a manufacturing site is producing wafers, reticles, ICs or PCB products, our highly trained service teams collaborate with customers to determine the best products and services to meet technology and business requirements.\nBacklog\nOur backlog, primarily consisting of sales orders where written customer requests have been received, decreased from  $9.83 billion as of June 30, 2024, to $7.86 billion as of June 30, 2025, as many of our capacity constrained suppliers made new investments to meet our growing needs, enabling us to deliver products more quickly than in the pandemic and early post-pandemic periods. Lead-time expectations, particularly from our largest customers, reverted to historical levels from the elevated lead times driven by the post-pandemic induced supply chain disruptions, and demands from a large number of new fabs in Asia normalized following multiple years of strong deliveries. We expect to recognize approximately 71% to 76% of this amount as revenue in the next 12 months, 20% to 25% in the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter, but this estimate is subject to constant change. The amount of backlog and timing of revenue recognition is driven by multiple variables, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes in government regulations, the readiness of customer fabs, end market needs for capacity, changes in the estimated versus actual start time of customers’ projects, timing of delivery and installation dates and supply chain constraints. As customers try to balance the evolution of their technological, production or market needs with the timing and content of orders placed with us, there is increased risk of order modifications, pushouts or cancellations. Our backlog on any particular date does not provide meaningful information about the timing of future revenue recognition. \nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies\nWe perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy to manufacture components and major subassemblies. Our in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies acquired from third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing activities occur in the U.S., Singapore, Israel, Germany, U. K., Italy and China. Our supply chain strategy incorporates considerations for ethical labor practices, responsible minerals sourcing, and Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines, and there are increasing regulatory expectations on the environmental, social and/or geographic provenance of materials or components that may at times require us to incorporate further such considerations to our supply chain strategy.\n6\nTable of Contents\nSome critical parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, “parts”) that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications, while other parts are standard commercial products. We use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials to manufacture and support our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible. Certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Through our business interruption planning, we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by, among other things, monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials, providing financial support and incentives to encourage vendors to increase capacity when required, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials, and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.\nAlthough we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or disruptions within our suppliers’ often complex supply chains, could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition\nThe worldwide market for technologically advanced process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufacturers is highly competitive, with important competitive factors including system performance, ease of use, reliability, technical service and support, and overall cost of ownership. However, we believe that, while the competitive factors listed are important, the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated capabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity, improve yields and reduce waste. To remain competitive, we use significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest significantly in product R&D. In each of our product markets, we have many competitors, including companies such as Applied Materials, Inc., ASML Holding N.V., Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Onto Innovation, Inc. and Lasertec, Inc., some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved pricing and performance characteristics. We may also face future competition from new market entrants overseas or domestically. Our ability to compete in this area depends upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the U.S., and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region. We maintain our market position by building long-term relationships with our customers to meet their dynamic needs, as well as anticipating future market demands and enabling our customers to accelerate adoption and production of new technologies, as discussed further in the “Industry” section of this Item 1. Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with our industry-leading portfolio of products and services. However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share. Should this occur, it could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nPatents and Other Proprietary Rights\nWe protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of IP laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through IP laws. As of June 30, 2025, we owned over 8,500 active patents in the U.S. and other countries and had over 3,500 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2044. In addition, from time to time, we acquire license rights under U.S. and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties, and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other security measures.\nAlthough we consider patents and other IP significant to our business, no single patent, copyright or trade secret is essential to us as a whole or to any of our business segments.\nNo assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications, that license assignments will be made as anticipated, or that our patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology.\n7\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulations    \nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including, but not limited to, laws, rules and regulations related to anti-corruption, antitrust, data privacy requirements, employment, environmental, foreign exchange controls, health and safety requirements, immigration, import/export requirements, IP and tax. Compliance with these laws and regulations does not presently have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate in the case of environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could subject us to future liabilities.\nThe recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government (“U.S. Tariffs”), along with countermeasures taken by foreign countries, have had an adverse impact on our results of operations, although the impact was not material in fiscal year 2025. There is uncertainty around the ultimate duration, size and substance of the tariffs, including reciprocal actions against the U.S. by other countries.\nFor information about risks related to government regulations, see Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Initiatives\nKLA strives to proactively manage and address the ESG topics most important to our stakeholders. Guided by our values, we have integrated ESG considerations into many of our business practices and policies, and work together with our customers, peers, partners and suppliers to promote improvement in human rights, labor, environment, health and safety, anti-corruption, ethics and management system standards within our operations and our supply chain. Our ESG initiatives are another way KLA seeks to deliver long-term value for our stockholders and draw on our core values.\nWe work across our global footprint to shape a more sustainable future in collaboration with our customers and suppliers. As part of our drive to be better, we have science-based targets to reduce emissions which were validated in 2024 by the Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”). Our targets include using 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. These targets covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions utilize a 2021 baseline.\nIn January 2025, we entered into a long-term virtual power purchase agreement to purchase a portion of the output generated from a solar energy project for a fixed price. As part of this agreement, we will also receive renewable energy credits commensurate with the power we acquire. These credits allow us to characterize a commensurate portion of our energy usage as deriving from renewable energy, helping to reduce our Scope 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, and accelerating the progress towards our targets mentioned above. This agreement had no material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows during the year ended June 30, 2025.\nWe understand that sustainability is a shared endeavor across the value chain and broader economy. Beginning in 2023, KLA engages directly with key supply chain partners (as defined by their share of our purchased goods and services emissions) to reduce their contribution to our Scope 3 footprint, align on common goals and enhance overall transparency. Our company-wide Environmental Management Policy underscores complying with applicable environmental laws and standards across company locations globally. In 2023, we established a global waste and water policy to guide our efforts in these spaces as well. KLA recognizes the importance of protecting and respecting our environment and energy resources throughout our operations for future generations, and follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, transparently reporting climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor various risks, including climate-related and other ESG-related risks, even if some are not currently expected to have a material impact on KLA’s business or financial condition for assessed time horizons.\nFor more information on ESG, see KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report on our website; however, this citation is provided solely for informational purposes and the content of KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing. We include details in our 2023 Global Impact Report and other similar disclosures that are not included in this Form 10-K because we seek to be responsive to various areas of interest of our stakeholders; however, such information generally does not, and is not expected to, have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. In addition, no assurance can be given that our ESG initiatives will have the intended results or be able to be completed as currently envisioned, whether due to cost, feasibility or other constraints. Our \n8\nTable of Contents\n2024 Global Impact Report is expected to be published in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and, for the avoidance of doubt, is also not incorporated by reference into this filing.\nHuman Capital Management \nAt KLA, our success is driven by the unique tapestry of backgrounds and experiences that all employees bring to the table. We recognize that our competitive advantage is our people and the technology they develop. We believe it is critical to anticipate, attract, grow and inspire talent that exhibits our core values. As talent and retention continue to be a challenging issue for many companies, we strive to work proactively to address these concerns. We also aim to support employees’ personal and professional growth. Our talent development programs focus on developing the whole person through comprehensive training offerings, employee engagement programs and health and wellness activities. We work to lead through exceptional training programs and professional development while providing our employees with a safe, secure and healthy environment that enables them to thrive and feel included and empowered.\nOur Core Values\nAt KLA, our core values – demonstrating perseverance; striving to be better; being honest, forthright, and consistent; building high-performing teams; and being indispensable to our customers – serve as a foundation for our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders and reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and corporate citizenship in the places where we do business.\nOur Workforce\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 15,000 regular full-time employees and approximately 200 part-time and temporary employees in facilities located in 18 major regions. Approximately 32% of our regular full-time employees are located in the U.S., 19% in Europe and Middle Eastern countries and 49% in Asia, with approximately 20% engaged in manufacturing, 27% in R&D, 28% in customer service, 5% in sales and marketing and 20% in other roles. None of our employees are represented by a labor union; however, there is a trade union delegation for our employees in Belgium and our employees in the German operations of our MIE and Laser Imaging Systems business units are represented by employee works councils. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.\nIn fiscal year 2025, our overall employee voluntary turnover rate was under 3.8%.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAt KLA, our talent is the heartbeat of our organization. We value our employees as individuals and aim to recognize and support their needs so they can bring their best selves to work every day. We engage with our employees about what they need to be successful in and beyond the workplace.\nWe conduct an annual compensation review to ensure our total compensation is competitive and fair relative to our peers and internal standards. We link a significant portion of compensation to Company and business unit performance. A broad base of our employees is eligible for our long-term benefit program, to share in our success, through restricted stock units (“RSU”) and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). We also provide incentive bonus or profit sharing to employees.\nIn addition to providing our employees with competitive compensation packages, we provide a range of benefits to support employee well-being. Our benefits are designed to meet the needs of employees and their families and may include leave programs (e.g., paid time off, parental leave and bereavement leave), health coverage, income replacement programs, retirement savings schemes and access to employee assistance and work-life programs, based on local needs and practices. In several regions, we offer programs and opportunities to employees to help improve their health and well-being. KLA’s virtual and in-person well-being course offerings encompass physical, financial, and mental health.\nInclusion for All\nWe believe inclusion is everybody’s job, and that making it a reality requires not just policies but also conscious, considerate individual actions, multiplied daily across the organization. Through our ongoing Inclusion for All initiative, we aim to create a sense of belonging that weaves throughout KLA, embracing each individual’s backgrounds and experiences, celebrating everyone’s perspectives and knitting together teams that drive corporate and personal success.\nLearning and Development\nWe offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at KLA. We emphasize stretch assignments, on-the-job development, as well as classroom and online training. Our employees have access to a wide range of programs, workshops, \n9\nTable of Contents\nclasses and resources to help them excel in their careers and share what they know with others. Our performance management process includes performance feedback against goals and a review of key competencies that are needed to be successful at KLA and career development discussions.\nWe emphasize frequent one-on-one meetings between managers and employees and regular coaching and feedback sessions. Through coaching and mentorship programs, our employees are inspired to push the boundaries of their comfort zones and seek creative solutions.\nIf our employees pursue external learning opportunities and education, we have tuition reimbursement programs that support that too. Through our partnerships with Stanford University and the University of Michigan, employees can pursue advanced degrees in engineering that are customized for KLA, and the skills and competencies required to support our customers. We also offer a competitive student loan reimbursement program in the U.S.\nWe have a robust succession planning process especially targeted at director level positions and above. Additionally, our Values in Action training, also targeted at the director level and above, provides further guidance on our values, business ethics and our focus on Inclusion For All. Most of our employees are also required to take annual training courses and regular certifications related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data privacy and workplace health and safety.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on several topics. The feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess employee sentiment, identify areas of improvement and guides our decision-making as it relates to people management. We created action plans and involved our workforce in developing potential solutions to address these top concerns. We created initiatives including global manager communications, individual and team coaching and a training course titled “Engaging with Engagement” to enable continuous improvement in employee engagement. In addition, our executives conduct regular quarterly webcasts that enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open Q&A session.\nEmployee Health and Safety \nThe health and safety of our employees is paramount to our success. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this through promoting strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety, including recognition and control of workplace hazards, tracking injury and illness rates, utilizing a global travel health program and maintaining detailed emergency and disaster recovery plans.\nOur goal is always zero accidents across our facilities, and to achieve that, we conduct proactive risk assessments and audits to constantly improve our efforts. We implemented a global standard for our incidents to promote consistency across our regions, and continually outperform industry averages for injury rates.\nWe made a commitment to globalize our ISO 45001 (the internationally recognized standard for Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems) certification and expand our ISO 14001 (the internationally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems) certification beyond our larger sites. In calendar-year 2024, we achieved the certification for ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 across our main production and R&D facilities. As of calendar year-end 2024, our sites in Singapore; Newport, Wales; Milpitas, California; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Weilburg, Germany; and our two Israel locations in Migdal HaEmek and Yavne are certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 45001.\nWe are focused on reducing safety risks across business units and at corporate sites worldwide. We revised our approach to risk assessments to “risk rank” our own operations. We are utilizing this system not only to measure our own performance, but also to help improve the performance of our supply chain and customers. All new hires are required to complete a health and safety training program. In addition, our service technicians are required to achieve and maintain role-specific safety training certifications. Our excellent safety record, which is less than half of the semiconductor industry average, is a tribute to our employees’ efforts, the breadth and depth of our training programs and our dedication to safety policy management.\nFor more information on Human Capital, see KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report on our website; however, this citation is provided solely for informational purposes, and the content of KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing.",

This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (see “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”). Discussions and analysis of fiscal year 2024 as compared against fiscal year 2023 have been omitted and can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC.\n35\nTable of Contents\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support R&D and manufacturing of ICs, wafers and reticles. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. We also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of PCBs, specialty semiconductor devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. In addition, our services business has grown consistently each quarter on a year-over-year basis and accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025, due to increases in the installed base of KLA systems. Our services revenue, which is generated largely from recurring “subscription-like” contracts, increases the value of our contract offerings and extension of system lifetimes resulting from growth in legacy semiconductor markets.\nOur semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets: memory and foundry/logic. End-market demand drivers that are expected to continue to benefit KLA in the long term include adoption of EUV in HVM for Logic and DRAM memory, which drives new process control requirements and growth in key markets for KLA. Demand for advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly evident in the 2-nanometer node, which is seeing higher levels of investment and process control intensity, continues to drive investments in AI. Increasing complexity and value of semiconductor packages, particularly for AI and HPC applications, is also driving significant growth in our advanced packaging business. The digitization of all industries, including 5G markets, advances in healthcare and industrial applications, together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles, are powering leading-edge design node technology investments and capacity expansions. While we continue to invest in technological innovation, factors such as delays from customers in adopting new chips and technology methods could impact process control capital intensity. Push out or cancellation of deliveries to our customers could still cause earnings volatility, due to the timing of revenue recognition as well as increased risk of inventory-related charges.\nWe are organized into three reportable segments, as follows:\n•\nSemiconductor Process Control: a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help IC manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production.\n•\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process: advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.\n•\nPCB and Component Inspection: a range of inspection, testing and measurement, and direct imaging for patterning products used by manufacturers of PCBs, advanced packaging, MEMS and other electronic components. \nA majority of our revenues are derived from outside the U.S., and include geographic regions such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Europe and Israel, and Rest of Asia. China remains a major region for manufacturing of legacy node logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Additionally, a significant portion of global PCB manufacturing has migrated to China. Chinese government initiatives around self-sustainability are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the U.S. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector, the U.S. government has tightened export controls for commodities, software, and technology (collectively, “items”) destined to China over the past several years. In the last few years, Commerce has adopted regulations and added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List (a list of parties that are generally ineligible to receive U.S.-regulated items without prior licensing from Commerce), restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license. In addition, Commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List. The inability to obtain export licenses has resulted in a reduction to our backlog and required us to return some deposits received from customers in China for purchase orders, and limited our ability to meet our contractual obligations and sell our products or services to our customers in China. The percentage of our overall revenue from Chinese customers decreased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024. However increased investments in process control to meet leading-edge demand by our customers in Taiwan have contributed to our overall revenue increase in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024. \nThe recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government, along with countermeasures taken by foreign countries, have had an adverse impact on our results of operations, though the impact was not material in fiscal year 2025. There continues to be uncertainty around the ultimate duration, size and substance of the tariffs, including reciprocal actions against the U.S. by other \n36\nTable of Contents\ncountries. However, despite headwinds from tariffs, our gross margin and overall financial performance improved in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 due to higher revenue volume on products and services sold and cost management. \nWe are continuously assessing the aggregate potential impact of government regulations and tariffs on our financial results and operations. See Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this report for more information regarding how such actions by the U.S. government or another country could significantly impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers, especially in China, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years:\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nTotal revenues\n$\n12,156,162 \n$\n9,812,247 \n$\n10,496,056 \nCosts of revenues\n$\n4,751,867 \n$\n3,928,073 \n$\n4,218,307 \nGross margin\n60.9 \n%\n60.0 \n%\n59.8 \n%\nNet income attributable to KLA\n$\n4,061,643 \n$\n2,761,896 \n$\n3,387,277 \nDiluted net income per share attributable to KLA\n$\n30.37 \n$\n20.28 \n$\n24.15 \nWe continue to focus on returning cash to our investors, making $2.15 billion in share repurchases and paying $904.6 million in dividends in the year ended June 30, 2025. We increased the dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 to $1.90 per share per quarter, which was our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. Refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below for more information on our strong cash flow generation and strategy of returning excess cash to our stockholders.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nA critical accounting estimate is defined as one that has a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Where applicable, we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding critical accounting estimates. See Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition.\n We recognize revenue from sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the goods or services to the customer. The transaction price for our contracts with customers is allocated among the identified performance obligations and consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage. \nManagement uses judgment in identifying performance obligations, determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation and allocating consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations based on the SSP. We estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have established SSP ranges for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, management also uses judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and considers several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer, which could also impact the timing of revenue recognition, and could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Although our products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or a material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These \n37\nTable of Contents\ncredits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.\nInventory Valuation.\n Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand for meeting our product manufacturing plans and our customers’ support requirements. The estimate of net realizable value of inventory is impacted by assumptions regarding general semiconductor market conditions, manufacturing schedules, technology changes, new product introductions and possible alternative uses, and requires us to use significant judgment that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. If in any period we anticipate an adverse change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. The potential negative impact based on future demand is not practically quantifiable. On the other hand, if in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down in a previous period to a level below the ultimate realized selling price, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of revenues resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. A decrease in the future average selling prices would not have a material impact on the estimated net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories. \nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment.\n We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could affect the likelihood that we will be required to recognize an impairment charge for goodwill include, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our market share and declines in revenues or profits at our reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference.\nWe determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach or market approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are judgmentally weighted. The income approach is estimated through discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is computed by adding the present value of the estimated annual discounted cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This valuation technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and other inputs. The estimated growth rates for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of anticipated future performance of the business. The residual value is estimated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are calculated as the weighted average cost of capital of comparable peer companies, adjusted for company-specific risk. The market approach estimates the fair value of a reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method, which uses revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we noted a continued deterioration of the long-term forecast for our PCB business, which is part of our PCB and Component Inspection reportable segment. We also completed an internal reorganization affecting the composition of reporting units within our Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Component Inspection reportable segments. These two events triggered goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment tests, which resulted in a $230.4 million pre-reorganization goodwill impairment charge in the PCB and Component Inspection reportable segment. The quantitative assessment performed, which utilized a combination of the income and market approaches described above, was particularly sensitive to changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions. For example, if these estimates and assumptions were adjusted to the extent the fair value of the reporting unit was calculated to be 10% lower, we would have incurred an additional approximately $50 million impairment charge.\nDue to the downward revision of financial outlook for our PCB and Display businesses, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment and recorded impairment losses related to goodwill of $192.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\nIn March 2024, we made the decision to exit the Display business but continue to provide services to the installed base for the discontinued product lines. This decision triggered a quantitative impairment assessment for the Display reporting unit as of March 31, 2024, which resulted in a total goodwill impairment charge of $70.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. \nLong-lived assets, including both tangible and purchased intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could affect the likelihood that we will be required to recognize an impairment charge for long-lived assets primarily include declines in our operating cash flows from the use of these assets.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFor finite-lived purchased intangible assets, we determine whether the assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest-level associated asset grouping. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the assets’ carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nWe determine the fair value of purchased intangible assets using the income approach, primarily by applying the relief-from-royalty or multi-period excess-earnings methods. In connection with the downward revision of financial outlook for our PCB and Display businesses noted above, we recorded impairment losses related to purchased intangible assets of $8.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and $26.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result of the Company's decision to exit the Display business, also described above, an immaterial purchased intangible asset impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThere can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our fair value calculations will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions are not realized, or if there are future changes in any of the assumptions due to a change in economic conditions or otherwise, it is possible that a further impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future.\nSee Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncome Taxes. \nThe calculation of our effective tax rate involves significant judgment in the application of complex tax laws among various tax jurisdictions worldwide; identifying uncertain tax positions; and estimating the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized in the future. We believe that our tax positions and judgments are reasonable, but actual results may differ. If one or more taxing authorities were to successfully overturn our tax positions, it could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUnrecognized tax benefits are recorded for uncertain tax positions on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Evaluation of tax positions, their technical merits, and measurements using cumulative probability are inherently subjective estimates since they require our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $258.6 million and $245.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis based on certain factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances; changes in tax law; audit settlements; new audit activities; and changes in accounting standards. Any changes to these factors can result in a material change to tax expense.\nOur calculations of deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on estimates and judgments related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and projections of future taxable income. The guidance requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the foreseeable future. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. We recorded tax valuation allowances of $310.6 million and $289.5 million as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily related to California credit carry-forwards. Based on the enacted income apportionment rules in California, our future California income tax liability will not be sufficient to fully utilize the credit carry-forwards. We assess on a quarterly basis whether there should be a change to the valuation allowance for some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. If there is a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we will be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets which may materially increase our tax expense. If there is a change in our ability to utilize the California credit carry-forwards, we will be required to reduce our valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets which may materially decrease our tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n39\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues and Gross Margin\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n \n \n \n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFY25 vs. FY24\nFY24 vs. FY23\nRevenues:\nProduct\n$\n9,472,854 \n$\n7,482,679 \n$\n8,379,025 \n$\n1,990,175 \n27 \n%\n$\n(896,346)\n(11)\n%\nService\n2,683,308 \n2,329,568 \n2,117,031 \n353,740 \n15 \n%\n212,537 \n10 \n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n12,156,162 \n$\n9,812,247 \n$\n10,496,056 \n$\n2,343,915 \n24 \n%\n$\n(683,809)\n(7)\n%\nCosts of revenues\n$\n4,751,867 \n$\n3,928,073 \n$\n4,218,307 \n$\n823,794 \n21 \n%\n$\n(290,234)\n(7)\n%\nGross margin\n60.9%\n60.0%\n59.8%\n0.9%\n0.2%\nOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are impacted by the amount of new orders we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding periods. Revenue is also impacted by average customer pricing, customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, increased trade restrictions as discussed in the “Executive Summary” section above and the availability of government incentives for semiconductor capital investments. Service revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.\nThe increase in total revenues by 24% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to the increase in our product revenues and is due to increased investments by leading edge foundries driven by the AI infrastructure buildout, strong customer adoption of our advanced packaging portfolio of products and strong demand for many of our products, especially those in our inspection portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of 4% in revenues from our customers in China.\nThe increase in service revenues by 15% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to the growth of our installed base.\nRevenues by segment\n(1)\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n \n \n \n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFY25 vs. FY24\nFY24 vs. FY23\nRevenues:\nSemiconductor Process Control\n$\n10,947,359 \n$\n8,733,556 \n$\n9,324,190 \n$\n2,213,803 \n25 \n%\n$\n(590,634)\n(6)\n%\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process\n587,107 \n528,701 \n543,398 \n58,406 \n11 \n%\n(14,697)\n(3)\n%\nPCB and Component Inspection\n621,721 \n552,491 \n631,604 \n69,230 \n13 \n%\n(79,113)\n(13)\n%\nTotal segment revenues\n$\n12,156,187 \n$\n9,814,748 \n$\n10,499,192 \n$\n2,341,439 \n24 \n%\n$\n(684,444)\n(7)\n%\n__________\n(1)\nSegment revenues exclude corporate allocations and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues during the relatively soft market in the first half of fiscal year 2025.\nThe following is a summary of revenues by major product categories for the indicated periods:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFY25 vs. FY24\nFY24 vs. FY23\nRevenues:\nWafer Inspection\n$\n6,198,815 \n51 \n%\n$\n4,333,296 \n44 \n%\n$\n4,336,663 \n41 \n%\n$\n1,865,519 \n43 \n%\n$\n(3,367)\n— \n%\nPatterning\n2,196,347 \n18 \n%\n2,054,442 \n21 \n%\n2,791,130 \n26 \n%\n141,905 \n7 \n%\n(736,688)\n(26)\n%\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process\n517,201 \n4 \n%\n470,565 \n5 \n%\n492,109 \n5 \n%\n46,636 \n10 \n%\n(21,544)\n(4)\n%\nPCB and Component Inspection\n355,891 \n3 \n%\n291,161 \n3 \n%\n378,030 \n4 \n%\n64,730 \n22 \n%\n(86,869)\n(23)\n%\nServices\n2,683,308 \n22 \n%\n2,329,568 \n24 \n%\n2,117,031 \n20 \n%\n353,740 \n15 \n%\n212,537 \n10 \n%\nOther\n204,600 \n2 \n%\n333,215 \n3 \n%\n381,093 \n4 \n%\n(128,615)\n(39)\n%\n(47,878)\n(13)\n%\nTotal\n$\n12,156,162 \n100 \n%\n$\n9,812,247 \n100 \n%\n$\n10,496,056 \n100 \n%\n$\n2,343,915 \n24 \n%\n$\n(683,809)\n(7)\n%\nThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues, primarily in our Semiconductor Process Control segment, for the indicated periods:\nFiscal Year Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nRevenues by region\nRevenues by region, based on ship-to location, for the periods indicated were as follows:\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nChina\n$\n4,042,567 \n33 \n%\n$\n4,196,727 \n43 \n%\n$\n2,867,443 \n27 \n%\nTaiwan\n3,205,392 \n27 \n%\n1,738,065 \n18 \n%\n2,493,379 \n24 \n%\nKorea\n1,452,826 \n12 \n%\n906,924 \n9 \n%\n1,895,710 \n18 \n%\nNorth America\n1,362,311 \n11 \n%\n1,070,791 \n11 \n%\n1,254,956 \n12 \n%\nJapan\n1,133,002 \n9 \n%\n963,203 \n10 \n%\n888,016 \n9 \n%\nEurope and Israel\n574,197 \n5 \n%\n540,263 \n6 \n%\n682,103 \n6 \n%\nRest of Asia\n385,867 \n3 \n%\n396,274 \n3 \n%\n414,449 \n4 \n%\nTotal\n$\n12,156,162 \n100 \n%\n$\n9,812,247 \n100 \n%\n$\n10,496,056 \n100 \n%\n41\nTable of Contents\nThere was a decrease in revenues from our customers in China, accounting for 33% of total revenues in fiscal 2025 compared to 43% of total revenues in fiscal 2024. This decrease comes after elevated levels of investment by our larger Chinese customers in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, which have now moderated, causing our revenues from Chinese customers to begin to normalize. Additionally, while many Chinese customers, encouraged by the growth potential of certain semiconductor markets and Chinese government initiatives around self-sustainability in domestic semiconductor production, continued to increase their semiconductor-related investments, more stringent U.S. export controls and regulations have also contributed to the decrease in revenue share from China. Our customers in Taiwan contributed to the increased revenues with increased investments in process control to meet leading edge demand driven by innovation and growth of new technologies like AI, with that region recording 27% and 18% of total revenues during fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The remaining regions accounted for less than 20% of total revenues individually in all periods.\nGross margin\nOur gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions.\nThe following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin: \nGross Margin\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024\n60.0\n \n%\nRevenue volume of products and services\n1.8 \n%\nMix of products and services sold\n(1.3)\n%\nManufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies\n0.4 \n%\nOther service and manufacturing costs\n— \n%\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2025\n60.9\n \n%\nChanges in gross margin from revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. Changes in gross margin from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements and amortization of intangible assets. Changes in gross margin from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk. Other service and manufacturing costs included lower inventory obsolescence charges offset by higher tariff and freight expenses in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024.\nResearch and Development\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n \n \n \n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFY25 vs. FY24\nFY24 vs. FY23\nR&D expenses\n$\n1,360,334 \n$\n1,278,981 \n$\n1,296,727 \n$\n81,353 \n6 \n%\n$\n(17,746)\n(1)\n%\nR&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues\n11 \n%\n13 \n%\n12 \n%\n(2)\n%\n1 \n%\nR&D expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our R&D efforts. As technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with R&D projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs and other expenses.\nR&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $70.1 million, an increase in depreciation expense of $5.9 million and an increase in engineering project material costs of $4.9 million.\nOur future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to make products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our R&D. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies.\n42\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n \n \n \n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFY25 vs. FY24\nFY24 vs. FY23\nSG&A expenses\n$\n1,029,734 \n$\n969,509 \n$\n986,326 \n$\n60,225 \n6 \n%\n$\n(16,817)\n(2)\n%\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues\n8 \n%\n10 \n%\n9 \n%\n(2)\n%\n1 \n%\nSG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in the following areas: facility-related expenses of $15.9 million, employee-related expenses of $12.9 million, depreciation expense of $12.0 million, promotional expenses of $8.3 million, travel expenses of $6.8 million and engineering project material costs of $6.1 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we noted a continued deterioration of the long-term forecast for our PCB business, which is part of our PCB and Component Inspection reportable segment. We also completed an internal reorganization affecting the composition of reporting units within our Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Component Inspection reportable segments. These two events triggered goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment tests, which resulted in a $239.1 million goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment charge in the PCB and Component Inspection reportable segment.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we noted a significant deterioration of the long-term forecast for our PCB and Display businesses. As a result, we recorded a $219.0 million goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge for the PCB and Display reporting unit in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In March 2024, we made the decision to exit the Display business but continue to provide services to the installed base for the discontinued product lines. As a result, we recorded a $70.5 million goodwill impairment charge, and an immaterial amount of purchased intangible assets were abandoned in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. See Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges were $7.7 million and $21.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to severance and related charges for the restructuring of the former PCB and Display operating segment, as described further in Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” as well as write-downs of certain right of use assets and fixed assets that were abandoned.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 19 “Restructuring Charges” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net \nYear Ended June 30,\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFY25 vs. FY24\nFY24 vs. FY23\nInterest expense\n$\n302,166 \n$\n311,253 \n$\n296,940 \n$\n(9,087)\n(3)\n%\n$\n14,313 \n5 \n%\nOther expense (income), net\n$\n(171,487)\n$\n(155,075)\n$\n(104,720)\n$\n(16,412)\n(11)\n%\n$\n(50,355)\n(48)\n%\nInterest expense as a percentage of total revenues\n2 \n%\n3 \n%\n3 \n%\nOther expense (income), net as a percentage of total revenues\n(1)\n%\n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\nInterest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was comparable to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 as average debt outstanding was essentially unchanged.\nOther expense (income), net is comprised primarily of fair value adjustments and realized gains or losses on sales of marketable and non-marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, interest-related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our invested cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. \nThe change in Other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher interest income of $17.1 million due to higher interest earning balances and a \n43\nTable of Contents\nhigher net fair value gain of $7.0 million from an equity security compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher net foreign exchange losses of $10.2 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table provides details of income taxes:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n4,644,448 \n$\n3,190,032 \n$\n3,789,190 \nProvision for income taxes\n$\n582,805 \n$\n428,136 \n$\n401,839 \nEffective tax rate\n12.5 \n%\n13.4 \n%\n10.6 \n%\nTax expense was lower as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to goodwill impairment charges, which are non-deductible for income tax. There was a $230.4 million goodwill impairment charge during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to a $263.1 million goodwill impairment charge during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. \nOur future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, R&D credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We also continue to monitor the adoption of Pillar Two relating to the global minimum tax in each of our tax jurisdictions to evaluate its impact on our effective income tax rate. For some of the jurisdictions that have adopted Pillar Two in their tax legislation, it was effective for us beginning in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, and there was no material impact to our effective tax rate.\nFor discussions on tax examinations, assessments and certain related proceedings, see Note 14 “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of June 30,\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,078,908 \n$\n1,977,129 \n$\n1,927,865 \nMarketable securities\n2,415,715 \n2,526,866 \n1,315,294 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n$\n4,494,623 \n$\n4,503,995 \n$\n3,243,159 \nPercentage of total assets\n28 \n%\n29 \n%\n23 \n%\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCash flows:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,081,903 \n$\n3,308,575 \n$\n3,669,805 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(202,481)\n(1,476,985)\n(482,571)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(3,785,687)\n(1,776,017)\n(2,830,289)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n8,044 \n(6,309)\n(13,988)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n101,779 \n$\n49,264 \n$\n342,957 \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\nAs of June 30, 2025, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $4.49 billion, compared to the $4.50 billion balance as of June 30, 2024. Refer to below discussions of sources and uses of cash during the fiscal year.\nAs of June 30, 2025, $1.11 billion of our $4.49 billion cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $66.6 million of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the \n44\nTable of Contents\nrepatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $1.04 billion of the $1.11 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities:\nWe typically finance our liquidity requirements through cash generated from our operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $4.08 billion compared to $3.31 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in customer and other collections of approximately $1.4 billion, mainly driven by higher shipments; partially offset by increases in accounts payable payments of approximately $480 million and employee-related payments of approximately $130 million.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $202.5 million compared to $1.48 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of $1.33 billion, primarily due to the sale of investments to support the $750.0 million debt principal payment in November 2024, and $6.3 million in proceeds from capital-related government assistance, partially offset by increases in capital expenditures of $57.9 million and IP acquisitions of $5.0 million.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities:\nNet cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $3.79 billion compared to $1.78 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly due to a debt repayment of $750.0 million contrasting with debt-related proceeds of $735.0 million in the prior year, and increases in cash used for common stock repurchases of $414.2 million and cash paid for dividends and dividend equivalents of $131.6 million.\nStock Repurchases:\nThe shares of common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. The total amount of stock repurchases during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 were $2.15 billion, $1.74 billion and $1.31 billion, respectively. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to mitigate the potential dilutive impact related to our equity incentive plans and shares issued in connection with our ESPP as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders. As of June 30, 2025, an aggregate of $5.03 billion was available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program, which reflects an increase in the authorized repurchase amount of $5.00 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nCash Dividends:\nThe total amounts of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividend equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 were $904.6 million, $773.0 million and $732.6 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 reflected the increases in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $1.45 to $1.70 per share and from $1.70 to $1.90 per share that were announced during the first and fourth quarters, respectively of fiscal 2025. The amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested RSUs with dividend equivalent rights were $13.3 million and $11.8 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested RSUs as described in Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn August 7, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.90 per share. Refer to Note 20 “Subsequent Events” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2025.\nSenior Notes:\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured notes totaling $5.95 billion with due dates ranging from fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2063. For additional information on these senior notes, see Note 8 “Debt” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2024, we repaid $750.0 million of Senior Notes. As of June 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the relevant indentures associated with the Senior Notes.\n45\nTable of Contents\nRevolving Credit Facility:\nOn July 3, 2025, we replaced our Prior Revolving Credit Facility with a new unsecured Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity date of July 3, 2030, that allows us to borrow up to $1.50 billion. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount up to $500.0 million in the aggregate. See Note 20 “Subsequent Events” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all covenants under the prior Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2025 (the leverage ratio was 1.02 to 1.00 compared to a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 on a quarterly basis covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. For additional information on the Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 8 “Debt” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nFactoring Arrangements\nWe have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LC”), without recourse, received from customers as payment for goods and services.\nThe following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LC for the indicated periods:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nReceivables sold under factoring agreements\n$\n230,552 \n$\n254,889 \n$\n328,933 \nProceeds from sales of LC\n$\n55,525 \n$\n22,242 \n$\n69,247 \n Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in Other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.\nWe maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $126.8 million, of which $92.7 million had been issued as of June 30, 2025, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax and other operating requirements of our consolidated subsidiaries worldwide.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of June 30, 2025, our aggregate principal debt obligation was $5.95 billion, which represents Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2029 to fiscal year 2063. Our principal note of $750.0 million was repaid in November 2024. Interest payments of $5.48 billion associated with all of our debt obligations are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of Senior Notes. For additional details, refer to Note 8 “Debt” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe maintain commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as goods, services, and other assets in the ordinary course of business. Our estimate of our significant purchase commitments primarily for material, services, supplies and asset purchases is $2.42 billion as of June 30, 2025, a majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. For additional details, refer to Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe also have commitments for our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan of $349.5 million, an income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions of $272.0 million and an operating lease obligation of $234.1 million.\nWorking Capital:\nWorking capital was $6.61 billion as of June 30, 2025, which represents an increase of $1.24 billion compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $4.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as $1.50 billion availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances, marketable securities and our $1.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our \n46\nTable of Contents\nliquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings as of June 30, 2025 are summarized below: \nRating Agency\nRating\nFitch\nA\nMoody’s\nA2\nS&P\nA-\nFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries, our financial position, material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements:\nAs of June 30, 2025, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources that are material to investors.
