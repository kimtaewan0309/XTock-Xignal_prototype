Additional items that may have an impact on our businesses are discussed in Item 1A.—\nRisk Factors\n and Item 3.—\nLegal Proceedings\n.\n7 | 2024 Annual Report\nExecutive Summary\nIncorporated in 1981, AES is a global energy company accelerating the future of energy. Together with our many stakeholders, we are improving lives by delivering the greener, smarter energy solutions the world needs. Our diverse workforce is committed to continuous innovation and operational excellence, while partnering with our customers on their strategic energy transitions and continuing to meet their energy needs today.\nOur Strategy\nAES is the next-generation energy company with over four decades of experience helping the world transition to clean, renewable energy. \nThe focus of our strategy is to partner with large corporations that are transitioning to carbon-free sources of electricity. We are very well-positioned as a leading provider of renewable energy to data center companies, particularly in the U.S., and to large mining companies outside the U.S. These customers want to work with AES due to our track record of providing customized solutions that best serve their specific needs and delivering our projects on time and on budget. Projections for electricity demand growth from data centers in the U.S. continue to increase exponentially, and today, this demand is expected to grow to up to 90 GW by 2030, representing an increase of approximately 60 GW. \nIn 2024, we signed long-term contracts for 4.4 GW of renewables, bringing our backlog of projects — those with signed contracts, but which are not yet in operation — to 11.9 GW. Our backlog serves as the core component of future growth. As a result, we have been consistently rated by Bloomberg New Energy Finance as one of the top two largest sellers globally of renewable power to corporate customers.\nAt the same time, we have embarked on the most ambitious investment growth in the history of our U.S. utilities, which will improve the reliability and quality of service for our customers, while maintaining some of the lowest rates in both states where our utilities operate. AES Indiana and AES Ohio are now two of the fastest growth U.S. utilities, with projected double-digit rate base growth through 2027, based on necessary investments for our customers.\nWe are also seeing additional investment opportunities from data center growth in our utility service areas, above and beyond existing rate base projections. Our utilities have many natural advantages that are attractive to large technology companies, such as proximity to fiber networks and the presence of ample land and water. We have worked to proactively identify sites that are well-positioned to support new data centers, capitalizing on our \n8 | 2024 Annual Report\ndeep relationships with technology companies.\n2024 Strategic Highlights\n•\nWe were awarded or signed 6.8 GW of new contracts, including renewables PPAs, data center load growth at our US utilities, and retail supply for data centers:\n◦\n4.4 GW of renewables under long-term PPAs;\n◦\n2.1 GW of data center growth at AES Ohio; and\n◦\n310 MW of retail supply to support data centers throughout Ohio.\n•\nWe were ranked the #1 provider of clean energy globally to corporations by BloombergNEF, representing the third consecutive year as a top seller.\n•\nWe completed the construction or acquisition of 3.0 GW of renewables, primarily in the United States and Chile, and completed the construction of a 670 MW combined cycle gas plant in Panama.\n•\nOur backlog, which includes projects with signed contracts, but which are not yet operational, is now 11.9 GW, consisting of:\n◦\n4.9 GW under construction; and\n◦\n7.0 GW with signed PPAs, but that are not yet under construction.\n•\nAES Indiana received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to implement new base rates and an ROE of 9.9%, supporting an investment program that will improve reliability for customers and support local economic development.\n•\nIncluding transactions in 2023 and 2024, we announced or closed nearly three-quarters of our $3.5 billion asset sale proceeds target through 2027.\n◦\nIn September 2024, announced a strategic partnership to support AES Ohio's robust growth plans by agreeing to sell a 30% indirect interest to CDPQ for approximately $546 million.\n◦\nIn October 2024, closed the sale of our 47.3% interest in AES Brasil for approximately $630 million, including sale and hedge proceeds.\n•\nRetired 481 MW of coal generation in Chile and the United States, for a total of 13.4 GW of coal exits announced or closed since 2017.\nOverview\n \nGeneration\nWe currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 32,109 MW, including generation from our integrated utility, AES Indiana. Our generation fleet is diversified by technologies and fuel type. See discussion below under \nFuel Costs\n.\nPerformance drivers of our generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, availability of generation capacity to meet contracted sales, fuel costs, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity, fixed-cost management, and competition. The financial performance of our renewables business is also impacted by our ability to complete construction projects and earn U.S. renewable tax credits.\nContract Sales \n— Most of our generation businesses sell electricity and associated generation attributes under medium- or long-term contracts (\"PPAs\") in either regulated or competitive markets (\"contract sales\") or under short-term agreements in competitive markets (\"short-term sales\"). Our medium-term contract sales have terms of two to five years, while our long-term contracts have terms of more than five years. These contract sales and short-term sales may also include RECs, as discussed below.\nContracts requiring fuel to generate energy, such as natural gas or coal, are structured to recover variable costs, including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel or energy supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion below under \nFuel Costs\n). These contracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing.\n9 | 2024 Annual Report\nCertain contracts include capacity payments that cover projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses, debt service, and a return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payments be denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs. In some U.S. markets, the capacity payment is only for the resource adequacy or reliability benefits from the generating facility, allowing us to separately monetize the electricity produced by the facility through either contract sales or short-term sales. \nContracts that do not have significant fuel cost or do not contain a capacity payment are structured based on long-term prices and may also include negotiated pass-through costs, allowing us to recover expected fixed and variable costs as well as provide a return on investment. \nMany of these contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs. We generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including fixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically hedge a significant portion of our exposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the \nShort-Term Sales\n section below.\nThus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in electricity and, as applicable, fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide or account for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability, availability, and efficiency standards required in the contract or otherwise.\nShort-Term Sales \n— Our generation businesses also sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with average terms of less than two years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves. \nMany of the short-term markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to provide additional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the market. \nOur renewable energy generation businesses may also sell RECs under short-term contracts, either through bilateral sales or over commodity exchanges.\nPlant Reliability and Flexibility \n— Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage availability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales and in certain contract sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs.\nFuel Costs \n— For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often enter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may financially hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts include indexation for fuels. In those cases, we seek to match our fuel supply agreements to the indexation. For certain projects, we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.\nIn short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for power prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding commodity price risk please see Item 7A.—\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n \nin this Form 10-K.\n10 | 2024 Annual Report\n50% of the capacity of our generation plants is fueled by renewables, including solar, hydro, wind, energy storage and landfill gas, which do not have significant fuel costs.\n32% of the capacity of our generation plants is fueled by natural gas. With the exception of our plants in the Dominican Republic and Panama, where we import LNG to utilize in the local market, we use gas from local suppliers in each market.\n16% of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our coal-fired plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants, and at our plant in Puerto Rico, we source coal from a mix of sources from the international market and in the local jurisdictions. To the extent possible, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel procurement.\n2% of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes pet coke or oil for fuel. We source oil and diesel locally at prices linked to international markets. We largely source pet coke from Mexico and the U.S. \nSeasonality, Weather Variations and Economic Activity \n— Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind resources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive markets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.\nFixed-Cost Management \n—\n \nIn our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the capacity payment or were otherwise factored in as a component of the long-term contract price. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.\nCompetition \n— For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited market competition impacting prices during the term of the contract. For short-term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.\nUtilities\nOur utility businesses consist of AES Indiana and AES Ohio in the U.S., and four utilities in El Salvador. AES' six utility businesses distribute power to 2.7 million customers and AES' two utilities in the U.S. also include generation capacity totaling 3,561 MW.\n AES Indiana,\n \nour fully integrated regulated utility, and AES Ohio, our transmission and distribution regulated utility, each operate as the sole distributors of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. AES Indiana owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity. AES Ohio owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to transmit and distribute electricity. Our distribution business in El Salvador faces limited competition due to significant barriers to enter the market. According to El Salvador's regulation, large regulated customers have the option of becoming unregulated users and requesting service directly from generation or commercialization agents.\nIn general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance drivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity, and reliability of service. Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRegulated Rate of Return and Tariff \n— In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (\"tariffs\") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet.\nOur utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed regulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator, within the framework of applicable local laws, and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.\n11 | 2024 Annual Report\nThe tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in its tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level and may include a pass-through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes, customers with demand above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract directly with the utility or with other retail energy suppliers and pay non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.\nThe regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage uncollectible amounts, quality of service and technical and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.\nSeasonality, Weather Variations, and Economic Activity \n— Our utility businesses are generally affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on the number of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions, and customers' historic usage levels and patterns. Retail sales, after adjustments for weather variations, are also affected by changes in local economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives, as well as the number of retail customers.\nReliability of Service \n— Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration and frequency of outages. Those standards may be explicit, with defined performance incentives or penalties, or implicit, where the utility must operate to meet customer and/or regulator expectations.\nDevelopment and Construction\n \nWe develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility business, new plants may be built or existing plants retrofitted in response to customer needs or to comply with regulatory developments. The projects are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is in key growth markets, such as the U.S. and Chile, where we can leverage our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses by adding renewable energy. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating the strategic fit, financial profile, projected returns and risk for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment. For some development projects, rather than advancing them through construction and maintaining long-term ownership of an operating facility, AES may monetize project value by entering into Develop-Transfer Agreements (\"DTAs\") in which we transfer assets to a third party prior to construction in exchange for appropriate compensation. These DTAs may be entered into for new generation facilities or other potential uses of our development assets, including for data centers.\nIn most cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners, when it is commercially attractive. We typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team supervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget, schedule, and the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards.\nSegments\nThe segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the businesses internally and is mainly organized by technology. \nWe are organized into four technology-oriented SBUs: \nRenewables\n (solar, wind, energy storage, and hydro generation facilities); \nUtilities\n (AES Indiana, AES Ohio, and AES El Salvador regulated utilities and their generation facilities); \nEnergy Infrastructure\n (natural gas, LNG, coal, pet coke, diesel, and oil generation facilities, and our businesses in Chile); and \nNew Energy Technologies \n(investments in Fluence, Uplight, Maximo, and other initiatives)\n \n— which are led by our SBU Presidents. \n12 | 2024 Annual Report\nWe have two lines of business: generation and utilities. Our Renewables, Utilities, and Energy Infrastructure SBUs participate in our first business line, generation, in which we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our Utilities SBU participates in our second business line, utilities, in which we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market. Our New Energy Technologies SBU includes investments in new and innovative technologies to support leading-edge greener energy solutions.\nWe measure the operating performance of our SBUs using Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. The Adjusted EBITDA by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2024 is shown below. The percentages for Adjusted EBITDA are the contribution by each SBU to the gross metric, i.e., the total Adjusted EBITDA by SBU, before deductions for Corporate. Our New Energy Technologies SBU generated losses for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Item 7.—\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—SBU Performance Analysis\n of this Form 10-K for reconciliation and definitions of Adjusted EBITDA.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Company's corporate activities are reported within \"Corporate and Other\" because they do not require separate disclosure. See Item 7.—\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n and Note 19—\nSegment and Geographic Information\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's segment structure.\n13 | 2024 Annual Report\n(1) \nNon-GAAP measure. See Item 7.—\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n—SBU Performance Analysis—Non-GAAP Measures\n for reconciliation and definition.\n14 | 2024 Annual Report\nRenewables\n \nOur Renewables SBU is well-positioned to take advantage of the growth in data centers driven by the increase in power demand for generative artificial intelligence. In 2024, our assets in operation grew to 13.2 GW, and we added an incremental 3.7 GW to our backlog of contracted projects. \nThe Renewables SBU has generation facilities in nine countries — the United States, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Bulgaria, the Dominican Republic, Jordan, and the Netherlands. \nGeneration \n— Total operating installed capacity of the Renewables SBU is 13,229 MW.

AES Clean Energy aims to solve customers' energy challenges by offering an expanded portfolio of innovative solutions based on cutting-edge technologies that are designed to accelerate customers' transitions to carbon-free energy. The generation capacity of the systems owned and/or operated under AES Clean Energy is 8,927 MW across the U.S., with another 3,306 MW under construction, including 1,524 MW of solar, 500 MW of wind, and 1,282 MW of energy storage. AES Clean Energy has a 7.3 GW backlog of projects, the majority of which are expected to come online through 2027. The expansion of data center needs related to the growing use of generative artificial intelligence are expected to be a significant accelerant to the growth of the U.S. renewables market and AES seeks to capture a significant portion of this market expansion.\nAES Clean Energy comprises AES Renewable Holdings, sPower, ACED, and other renewables assets, as part of its broader investments in the U.S. ACED was formed on February 1, 2021, as specifically identified projects in the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms were merged. ACED serves as the development vehicle for all future renewables projects in the U.S. Following the merger, ACED expanded organic and inorganic efforts to become a clear leader in the U.S. renewables industry. In 2024, it built off its successes in customer-centric mergers and acquisitions to add over 1 GW of high-quality projects to its backlog. Since 2021, the development pipeline has also more than doubled.\nKey Financial Drivers \n— The financial results of AES Clean Energy are primarily driven by the efficient construction and operation of renewable energy facilities across the U.S. under long-term PPAs (including long-term REC contracts), through which the energy price on the entire production of these facilities is determined. Tax credits associated with the development of U.S. renewables projects can be substantial and have increased with the adoption of the IRA. In 2024, AES recognized $1.3 billion related to the monetization of tax attributes to tax equity investors and transferability tax credit buyers relating to U.S. renewables projects, $20 million of which relates to a solar project owned by our utility at AES Indiana. The financial results of U.S. renewables assets are primarily driven by the amount of wind or solar resource at the facilities, availability of facilities, growth in projects, the profitable \n18 | 2024 Annual Report\ndevelopment and sale of energy, RECs, and other generation attributes to customers, and by tax credit recognition once placed in service.\nA majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. Based on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity structures, this could result in variability to earnings attributable to AES compared to the earnings reported at the facilities. In 2024, AES Clean Energy largely generated investment tax credits (\"ITCs\") from its renewables assets. We expect that the extension of the current ITCs and production tax credits (\"PTCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\"), will increase demand for our renewables products. Also, in 2023, AES Clean Energy began monetizing tax credits under the transferability provisions of the IRA. These tax credit sales reduce our tax rate under U.S. GAAP.\nDevelopment Strategy \n— As states, communities, and organizations of all types make commitments and plan to reduce their carbon footprints, renewables are the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the U.S. AES Clean Energy works with its customers to co-create and deliver the smarter, greener energy solutions that meet their needs, including 24/7 carbon-free energy. For example, AES has worked with several major technology companies to provide clean energy solutions to power their network of data centers and we see these relationships growing as utilization of generative artificial intelligence drives the expansion of data center use.\nIn 2024, AES Clean Energy signed or was awarded 3,506 MW of PPAs. As of December 31, 2024, AES Clean Energy's renewables project backlog includes 7.3 GW of projects for which long-term PPAs have been signed or, as applicable, contracts have been assigned through a regulatory process. The budget for construction of the projects currently under construction and the contracted projects is over $9 billion. The IRA includes increases, extensions, and/or new tax credits for onshore wind, solar, storage, and hydrogen projects. These changes in tax policy are supportive of our strategy to grow the AES Clean Energy business through the development of our 53 GW U.S. pipeline.\nAES Argentina\nBusiness Description \n— AES operates plants in Argentina within the Renewables SBU totaling 1,407 MW, representing 3% of the country's total installed capacity, and AES Argentina's plants are placed in strategic locations within the country in order to provide energy to the spot market and customers.\nAES primarily sells its energy in the wholesale electricity market where prices are largely regulated. In 2024, approximately 76% of the energy sold in the wholesale electricity market was produced by the hydropower plants, and 24% generated by the wind power plants.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nforced outages;\n•\nexposure to fluctuations of the Argentine peso;\n•\ntimely collection of FONINVEMEM installments and outstanding receivables (see\n \nInternational Energy Markets and Regulatory Environment\n \nbelow);\n•\nchanges in hydrology and wind resources; and\n•\ndomestic energy demand and exports.\nDevelopment Strategy\n \n— AES Argentina has a pipeline of 980 MW of wind and solar greenfield projects in different stages of development. These projects are adjacent or nearby to AES Argentina's current operating assets and could be used to participate in future private auctions for renewable PPAs.\nAES Colombia\nBusiness Description\n \n— W\ne operate in Colombia through AES Colombia, a subsidiary of AES Andes, which owns Chivor, a hydroelectric plant with an installed capacity of 1,000 MW and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric plant, both located approximately 100 miles east of Bogota, as well as the solar facilities of Castilla, Brisas, and San Fernando, 21 MW, 26 MW, and 61 MW respectively. AES Colombia’s installed capacity accounted for approximately 5% of system capacity at the end of 2024. AES Colombia is dependent on hydrological conditions, which influence generation and spot prices of non-contracted generation in Colombia.\nAES Colombia's commercial strategy aims to execute contracts with commercial and industrial customers and bid in public tenders, mainly with distribution companies, in order to reduce margin volatility with proper portfolio risk management. The remaining energy generated by our portfolio is sold to the spot market, including ancillary \n19 | 2024 Annual Report\nservices. Additionally, AES Colombia receives reliability payments for maintaining the plant's availability and generating firm energy during periods of power scarcity, such as adverse hydrological conditions, in order to prevent power shortages.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n— Hydrological conditions largely influence Chivor's power generation. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, while maximizing revenue through the sale of excess generation, is key to AES Colombia's results of operations. In addition to hydrology, financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nforced outages;\n•\nfluctuations of the Colombian peso; and\n•\nspot market prices.\nDevelopment Strategy\n \n— AES Colombia is committed to supporting its customers to diversify their energy supply and become more competitive. As part of this commitment, AES Colombia is developing a pipeline of 1.3 GW of solar and wind projects. Six wind projects totaling 1,149 MW are located in La Guajira, one of the windiest spots in the world. Of the 1,149 MW, 255 MW were awarded 15-year PPAs in the renewable auction in 2019 and have had environmental licenses granted. AES Colombia is also developing Girasoles, a 100 MW solar project located in the state of Tolima.\nAES Panama\nBusiness Description\n — AES owns and operates five hydroelectric plants totaling 705 MW of generation capacity, a wind farm of 55 MW, and five solar plants totaling 48 MW, which collectively represent 16% of the total installed capacity in Panama.\nThe majority of our hydroelectric plants in Panama are based on run-of-the-river technology, with the exception of 223 MW Changuinola plant with regulating reservoirs and the 260 MW Bayano plant. Hydrological conditions have an important influence on profitability. Variations in hydrology can result in an excess or a shortfall in energy production relative to our contractual obligations. Hydro generation is generally in a shortfall position during the dry season from January through May, which is offset by thermal and wind generation since its behavior is opposite and complementary to hydro generation.\nOur hydro assets are mainly contracted through medium to long-term PPAs with distribution companies, while a small volume of our hydro plants are contracted with unregulated users. Our hydro assets in Panama have PPAs with distribution companies expiring up to December 2030 for a total contracted capacity of 350 MW.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nchanges in hydrology, which impacts spot prices and exposes the business to variability in the cost of replacement power;\n•\nfluctuations in commodity prices, mainly fuel oil and natural gas, which affect the cost of thermal generation and spot prices;\n•\nconstraints imposed by the capacity of transmission lines connecting the west side of the country with the load, keeping surplus power trapped during the rainy season; and\n•\ncountry demand as GDP growth is expected to remain stable over the short and medium term.\nDevelopment Strategy\n \n— AES is investing in renewables projects within the region. This will increase complementary non-hydro renewables assets in the system and contribute to the reduction of hydrological risk in Panama.\nAES Mexico\nBusiness Description\n — Mesa La Paz is a 306 MW wind project developed under a joint venture with Grupo Bal, located in Llera, Tamaulipas. Mesa La Paz sells 72% of its power under long-term PPAs expiring up to 2045.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\ncontracting levels, providing additional benefits from improved operational performance, including performance incentives and/or excess energy sales;\n•\nchanges in the methodology to calculate spot energy prices or Locational Marginal Prices, which impacts the excess energy sales;\n•\nimproved operational performance and plant availability; and\n20 | 2024 Annual Report\n•\nchanges in wind resources.\nDevelopment Strategy\n \n— AES is actively working to develop new renewable energy projects that may increase its market share in the Mexican National Energy System, with a strong commitment to provide energy support for the economic growth of the country.\nAES Bulgaria\nBusiness Description\n — AES owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm (\"Kavarna\") with 156 MW of installed capacity. The power output of St. Nikola is sold to customers operating on the liberalized electricity market and the plant may receive additional revenue per the terms of an October 2018 Contract for Premium with the state-owned Electricity System Security Fund.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n—\n \nFinancial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nregulatory changes in the Bulgarian power market;\n•\navailability and load factor of the operating units;\n•\nthe level of wind resources; and\n•\nspot market price volatility beyond the level of compensation through the Contract for Premium.\nIn December 2022, Bulgaria implemented Regulation 2022/1854, approved by the European Council in October 2022 as an emergency intervention aiming at limiting energy prices in Europe. The main measure of interest to AES in Bulgaria is the limitation of revenues for \"infra-marginal\" producers, a category that includes renewables and other technologies which are providing electricity to the grid at a cost below the price level set by the more expensive “marginal” producers. Under the regulation, Kavarna captures up to 100% of the margin above the price cap determined as per the provisions in the State Budget law for the respective calendar year. This regulation has been extended through March 31, 2025 by the Bulgarian Parliament.\nAES Dominicana\nBusiness Description \n— \nAES Dominicana has three operating subsidiaries within the Renewables SBU, each of which are owned 65% by AES. Bayasol owns and operates a 50 MW solar farm, Santanasol operates a 50 MW solar farm, and Agua Clara operates a 50 MW wind farm.\nAES has a strategic partnership with the Estrella and Linda Groups (\"Estrella-Linda\"), a consortium of two leading Dominican industrial groups that manage a diversified business portfolio. In December 2023, AES completed the sale of an additional 10% ownership interest in AES Dominicana to the existing partners and a 10% interest to Grupo Popular's subsidiary, AFI Popular, selling 20% ownership interest in total. After this transaction, AES' ownership interest in AES Dominicana is 65%.\nIn December 2024, the Company signed an agreement to sell a 50% ownership interest in AES DR Renewable Holding, S.L. and its subsidiaries. The transaction is expected to close in 2025.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nchange in wind and solar resources due to heavy rains, hurricanes and other natural events that may affect the country;\n•\nconstraints imposed by the capacity of transmission lines and potential delays on the transmission expansion projects; and\n•\nrelated to projects under construction, changes in execution cost and scope of work that may delay the operation of the new renewables plants.\nAES Puerto Rico\nBusiness Description\n — AES Puerto Rico owns and operates Ilumina, a 24 MW solar facility in Puerto Rico. The plant is fully contracted through a long-term PPA with PREPA expiring in 2037. In addition, AES began construction on 485 MW of new renewables in 2024. See Item 7.—\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico\n for further discussion of the long-term PPAs with PREPA.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, operational performance and plant availability.\nDevelopment Strategy\n \n— Puerto Rico has clear goals of supplying its system from renewable resources, with a target of 100% by 2050. An intermediate target of 40% by 2025 had been previously established. However, a \n21 | 2024 Annual Report\nSenate Bill was filed on January 22, 2025 that proposes to amend the target established under Law 17-2019. In order to achieve the targets currently set, PREPA intends to launch six tender processes for renewable generation. As of the end of 2024, four tenders have been issued, however, the remaining two are currently on hold. \nThe Marahu Project, 70% owned by AES, is currently constructing the Salinas and Jobos renewables projects in Puerto Rico, including both solar and energy storage facilities. In January 2025, Marahu Project obtained a loan guaranty for $861 million from the US Department of Energy (DOE). To date, $322 million have been drawn, and the remainder of the loan will be drawn upon as required to fund construction costs.\nAES Jordan\nBusiness Description\n — In Jordan, AES has a 36% controlling interest in a 48 MW solar plant fully contracted with the national utility under a 20-year PPA expiring in 2039. We consolidate the results in our operations as we have a controlling interest in this business.\nAES Brasil\nBusiness Description\n \n—\n AES sold its interest in AES Brasil in October 2024. With an exclusive focus on renewable energy, AES Brasil had a portfolio leveraging hydro, solar, and wind generation. As a 100% renewable energy generator, AES Brasil held a diversified portfolio and expanded from an installed capacity of 2.7 GW in 2016 to 5.2 GW at time of sale in 2024, which was composed of hydroelectric plants (2,658 MW), wind complexes (2,189 MW), and solar complexes (328 MW).\n22 | 2024 Annual Report\n(1) \nNon-GAAP measure. See Item 7.—\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n—SBU Performance Analysis—Non-GAAP Measures\n for reconciliation and definition.\n23 | 2024 Annual Report\nUtilities\nOur Utilities SBU is the second largest contributor to our future growth, particularly in the U.S., where we are targeting a combined 10% annual growth in rate base at our two utilities: AES Indiana and AES Ohio. The expansion of data center needs related to the growing use of generative artificial intelligence has the potential to be a significant accelerant to the load growth of the U.S. utilities market. AES Indiana and AES Ohio are working with several companies to provide solutions for the electric service needs of data centers, and we see these relationships growing as utilization of generative artificial intelligence drives the expansion of data center use within our service territory. As part of this process, AES Ohio and AES Indiana are evaluating cost effective options to reliably serve these large data center customers.\nIn the Utilities segment, we also have four utilities in El Salvador and a portfolio of generation facilities, including at our integrated utility in Indiana, with installed operating capacity of 3,704 MW.

AES Indiana is an integrated utility that is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing, and selling electric energy to retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana and is subject to regulatory authority—see \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure \nbelow. AES Indiana has an exclusive right to provide electric service to the customers in its service area, covering about 528 square miles with an estimated population of approximately 968,000 people. \nAES Indiana owns and operates four generating stations, all within the state of Indiana. The first station, Petersburg, is coal-fired, and consists of four units. AES Indiana retired 230 MW Petersburg Unit 1 in May 2021 and 415 MW Petersburg Unit 2 in June 2023, which resulted in 630 MW of total retired economic capacity at this station. AES Indiana plans to convert the remaining two coal units at Petersburg to natural gas (see \nIntegrated Resource Plan \nbelow). The second station, Harding Street, consists of three natural gas-fired boilers and steam turbines and uses natural gas and fuel oil to power five combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana operates a 20 MW battery-based energy storage unit at this location, which provides frequency response. The third station, Eagle Valley, is a CCGT natural gas plant. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana helps meet its customers' energy needs with long-term contracts for the purchase of 200 MW of wind-generated electricity and 94 MW of solar-generated electricity. \nAES Indiana also owns and operates two renewable energy projects, including a 195 MW solar project located in Clinton County, Indiana (the \"Hardy Hills Solar Project\"), which achieved full commercial operations in May 2024, and a 106 MW wind facility located in Benton County, Indiana (the \"Hoosier Wind Project\"), which was acquired in February 2024.\nIn August 2023, AES Indiana completed the acquisition of Petersburg Energy Center, LLC, including the development of a 250 MW solar and 45 MW (180 MWh) energy storage facility (the \"Petersburg Energy Center project\"). The Petersburg Energy Center project is expected to be completed in 2025.\nIn June 2023, AES Indiana executed an agreement for the construction of the 200 MW (800 MWh) Pike County BESS project to be developed at the AES Indiana Petersburg Plant site in Pike County, Indiana. The Pike County BESS project is expected to be placed in service during the first quarter of 2025.\n25 | 2024 Annual Report\nKey Financial Drivers \n—\n \nAES Indiana's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition, AES Indiana's financial results are likely to be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to:\n•\nregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n•\nthe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulation; and\n•\ntimely recovery of capital expenditures and operation and maintenance costs.\nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure \n— AES Indiana is subject to comprehensive regulation by the IURC with respect to its services and facilities, retail rates and charges, the issuance of long-term securities, and certain other matters. The regulatory authority of the IURC over AES Indiana's business is typical of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. The IURC sets tariff rates for electric service provided by AES Indiana. The IURC considers all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes, including a fair return on assets used and useful to providing service to customers.\nAES Indiana's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and approved charges. In addition, AES Indiana's rates include various adjustment mechanisms, including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet AES Indiana's retail load requirements, referred to as the Fuel Adjustment Charge, (ii) a rider for the timely recovery of costs (including a return) to comply with environmental laws and regulations and investments in renewable energy projects, and recovery of costs related to generation consumables and environmental allowance expenses, referred to as the ECCRA, (iii) a rider to reflect changes in ongoing RTO costs, (iv) riders for passing through to customers wholesale sales margins and capacity sales above and below established annual benchmarks, (v) a rider for the timely recovery of costs (including a return) incurred for eligible TDSIC improvements, and (vi) a rider for cost recovery, lost margin recoveries and performance incentives from AES Indiana's demand side management energy efficiency programs. Each of these tariff rate components function somewhat independently of one another, but the overall structure of AES Indiana's rates is subject to review at the time of any review of AES Indiana's basic rates and charges. Additionally, AES Indiana's rider recoveries are reviewed through recurring filings.\nAES Indiana filed a petition with the IURC on June 28, 2023, for authority to increase its basic rates and charges to cover the rising operational costs and needs associated with continuing to serve its customers safely and reliably. The factors leading to AES Indiana's first base rate increase request in five years include inflationary impacts on operations and maintenance expenses, investments in the transmission and distribution systems, and modernization of its customer systems. AES Indiana is \nalso seeking recovery of increased costs to support its vegetation management plan, which covers the removal of overhang and tree trimming in its service territory. AES Indiana also seeks to better align depreciation expense with the period in which the generation plants provide service to customers and remove operational costs of the retired Petersburg units from rates.\n On April 17, 2024, the IURC issued an order (the \"2024 Base Rate Order\") approving the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that AES Indiana entered into on November 22, 2023, with the OUCC and the other intervening parties in AES Indiana’s base rate case filing. Among other matters and consistent with the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, the 2024 Base Rate Order approves an increase in AES Indiana's total annual operating revenue of $71 million for AES Indiana’s electric service. Updated customer rates and charges became effective on May 9, 2024. \nAES Indiana is one of many transmission system owner members in MISO, an RTO which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the U.S. MISO dispatches generation assets in economic order considering transmission constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region. AES Indiana offers electricity in the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. \nDevelopment Strategy \n—\n \nAES Indiana's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations and compliance with environmental regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall performance. \nSenate Enrolled Act 560, the Transmission, Distribution, and Storage System Improvement Charge (\"TDSIC\") statute, provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for new or replacement electric and gas transmission, distribution, and storage projects that a public utility undertakes for the purposes of safety, reliability, system modernization, or economic development. Provisions of the TDSIC statute require that requests for recovery include a plan of at least five years and not more than seven for eligible investments. The first 80% of eligible costs can be recovered using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, referred to as a TDSIC mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on, and of, the investment, including AFUDC, post-in-service carrying charges, \n26 | 2024 Annual Report\noperation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and property taxes. The remaining twenty percent of recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in the public utility’s next base rate case. The TDSIC mechanism is capped at an annual increase of two percent of total retail revenues.\nOn March 4, 2020, the IURC issued an order approving the projects in AES Indiana's seven-year TDSIC Plan for eligible transmission, distribution, and storage system improvements totaling $1.2 billion from 2020 through 2026. Beginning in June 2020, AES Indiana files an annual TDSIC rate adjustment for a return on, and of, investments through March 31 with rates requested to be effective each November. Annual TDSIC plan update filings are required to be staggered by six months as ordered by the IURC and are filed each December. The total amount of AES Indiana’s equipment net of depreciation, including carrying cost, approved for TDSIC recovery as of December 31, 2024 was $138 million. There are also $341 million of TDSIC capital costs that were rolled into base rates per the 2024 Base Rate Order, which are no longer in the TDSIC rider.\nIntegrated Resource Plan\n — In December 2022, AES Indiana filed its Integrated Resource Plan (\"IRP\"), which describes AES Indiana's Preferred Resource Portfolio for meeting generation capacity needs for serving AES Indiana's retail customers over the next several years. The Preferred Resource Portfolio is AES Indiana's reasonable least cost option and provides a cleaner and more diverse generation mix for customers. The 2022 IRP short-term action plan includes converting the two remaining coal units at Petersburg to natural gas. Additionally, AES Indiana plans to add up to 1,300 MW of wind, solar, and battery energy storage by 2027. \nOn March 11, 2024, AES Indiana filed for regulatory approval from the IURC to convert Petersburg Units 3 and 4 from coal to natural gas and to recover costs through future rates. The conversion of Unit 3 is expected to begin in February 2026 and be completed by June 2026 and the conversion of Unit 4 is expected to begin in June 2026 and be completed by December 2026. On November 6, 2024, the IURC issued an order approving the Petersburg repowering.\nAES Indiana expects to spend an estimated $2.8 billion on capital projects from 2025 through 2027, which includes AES Indiana's power generation and renewable energy projects discussed above, spending under AES Indiana's TDSIC Plan, as well as other new transmission and distribution projects.\nIn 2024 and 2022, AES Indiana received equity capital contributions of $225 million and $253 million, respectively, from AES and CDPQ on a proportional share basis to be used for funding needs related to AES Indiana’s TDSIC and replacement generation projects.\nAES Ohio \nBusiness Description \n— DPL is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is AES Ohio. AES Ohio is a utility company that transmits and distributes electricity to approximately 537,000 retail customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio and is subject to regulatory authority—see \nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure \nbelow. AES Ohio has the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services to its customers, and procures retail standard service offer (\"SSO\") electric service on behalf of residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental customers through a competitive bid auction process.\nIn September 2024, DPL entered into Purchase and Sale Agreements with CDPQ, pursuant to which DPL agreed to sell an aggregate indirect equity interest in AES Ohio of approximately 30% to CDPQ for total proceeds of approximately $546 million, subject to adjustment. It is anticipated that these transactions will close on the same day in the first half of 2025, and there will be no change in management or operational control of DPL or AES Ohio as a result of these transactions. \nThe Purchase Agreements are subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including, among others, receipt of the approval of the PUCO, the FERC, and completion of review by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (\"CFIUS\"). As of the filing of this report, these conditions have been satisfied, with approvals received from PUCO and FERC, and the CFIUS review completed. In addition, each of the parties to the Purchase Agreements has agreed to customary covenants therein.\nKey Financial Drivers \n— AES Ohio's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand and weather. AES Ohio's financial results are likely to be driven by other factors as well, including, but not limited to:\n•\nregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n•\nthe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulations; and\n•\ntimely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures.\n27 | 2024 Annual Report\nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure \n— AES Ohio is regulated by the PUCO for its distribution services and facilities, retail rates and charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio requirements, energy efficiency program requirements, and certain other matters. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over the delivery of electricity, SSO, and other retail electric services. \nElectric customers within Ohio are permitted to purchase power under contract from a Competitive Retail Electric Service (\"CRES\") provider or from their local utility under SSO rates. The SSO generation supply is provided by third parties through a competitive bid process. Ohio utilities have the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services in their state-certified territories. While Ohio allows customers to choose retail generation providers, AES Ohio is required to provide retail generation service at SSO rates to any customer that has not signed a contract with a CRES provider or as a provider of last resort in the event of a CRES provider default. SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and are established through a competitive bid process for the supply of power to SSO customers. \nAES Ohio's distribution rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. AES Ohio is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, capital structure, and cost of capital. AES Ohio's retail rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, the timely recovery of costs incurred related to power purchased through the competitive bid process, participation in the PJM RTO, severe storm damage, and energy efficiency. \nThe costs associated with providing high voltage transmission service and wholesale electric sales and ancillary services are subject to FERC jurisdiction. AES Ohio implemented a formula-based rate for its transmission service, effective May 3, 2020.\nAES Ohio is a member of PJM, an RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of a multi-state region, including Ohio. PJM also administers the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members.\nElectric Security Plan\n — Ohio law requires utilities to file either an Electric Security Plan (\"ESP\") or Market Rate Option (\"MRO\") plan to establish SSO rates. AES Ohio is currently operating pursuant to ESP 4, described below. From November 1, 2017 through December 18, 2019, AES Ohio operated pursuant to an approved ESP plan, which was initially approved in October, 2017 (ESP 3). On December 18, 2019, the PUCO approved AES Ohio's Notice of Withdrawal and reversion to its prior rate plan (ESP 1). Among other items, the PUCO Order approving the ESP 1 rate plan includes reinstating the non-bypassable RSC Rider, which provides annual revenues of approximately $79 million. The Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Council (“OCC”) has appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, the Commission’s decision approving the reversion to ESP 1 as well as argued for a refund of the Rate Stabilization Charge (\"RSC\") revenues dating back to August 2021. Oral arguments regarding this appeal have been scheduled for April 22, 2025.\nSmart Grid Comprehensive Settlement \n— On October 23, 2020, AES Ohio entered into a Stipulation and Recommendation (the Settlement) with the staff of the PUCO, various customers and organizations representing customers of AES Ohio and certain other parties with respect to, among other matters, AES Ohio's applications pending at the PUCO for (i) approval of AES Ohio's plan to modernize its distribution grid (Smart Grid Phase 1), (ii) findings that DP&L passed the SEET for 2018 and 2019, and (iii) findings that AES Ohio's ESP 1 satisfies the SEET and the more favorable in the aggregate (MFA) regulatory test. On June 16, 2021, the PUCO issued their opinion and order accepting the stipulation as filed. The OCC appealed the final PUCO order with respect to the 2018 and 2019 SEET to the Ohio Supreme Court on December 6, 2021. Oral arguments regarding this appeal have been scheduled for April 2, 2025.\nSmart Grid Phase 2 Plan — \nIn February 2024, AES Ohio filed a Smart Grid Phase 2 with the PUCO proposing a ten-year investment plan to begin after Smart Grid Phase 1 ends. On September 13, 2024, AES Ohio reached a settlement with the PUCO Staff and other parties on the pending Smart Grid Phase 2 Application. The settlement will provide for a four-year plan to invest $241 million of capital and $19 million of operations and maintenance expenses related to grid modernization, support of Distributed Energy Resources, Economic Development and an enhanced Telecommunications network. These costs will be recovered through the existing Infrastructure Investment Rider. An evidentiary hearing was held on October 29, 2024, and we expect an order from PUCO by the second quarter of 2025, prior to the end of Smart Grid Phase 1.\nESP 4\n \n—\n On September 26, 2022, AES Ohio filed its latest ESP (\"ESP 4\") with the PUCO. ESP 4 is a comprehensive plan to enhance and upgrade its network and improve service reliability, provide greater safeguards \n28 | 2024 Annual Report\nfor price stability and continue investments in local economic development. In April 2023, AES Ohio entered into a Stipulation and Recommendation with the PUCO Staff and seventeen parties (the “Settlement”) with respect to AES Ohio’s ESP 4 application, and, in August 2023, the PUCO approved the Settlement without modification. The Settlement provides for a three-year plan including the following; (i) a Distribution Investment Rider for the term of the ESP allowing for the timely recovery of distribution investments by AES Ohio based on a 9.999% return on equity, subject to revenue caps, (ii) recovery of approximately $66 million related to past expenditures by AES Ohio plus future carrying costs and the recovery of incremental vegetation management expenses up to certain annual limits during the term of ESP 4; and (iii) funding of programs for assistance to low-income customers and for economic development. With approval of this Settlement, the distribution rates that were approved by the PUCO in December 2022, and are described in the paragraph below, became effective on September 1, 2023.\n2020 Distribution Rate Case\n \n—\n In November 2020, AES Ohio filed a new distribution rate case application with the PUCO to increase AES Ohio’s base rates for electric distribution service to address, in part, increased costs of materials and labor and substantial investments to improve distribution structures. In December 2022, the PUCO issued an order on the application. Among other matters, the order (i) establishes a revenue increase of $76 million for AES Ohio’s base rates for electric distribution service and (ii) provides for a return on equity of 9.999% and a cost of long-term debt of 4.4% on a rate base of $783 million and based on a capital structure of 53.87% equity and 46.13% long-term debt. These rates went into effect on September 1, 2023 with the approval of AES Ohio’s ESP 4.\n2024 Distribution Rate Case Application\n \n—\n \nOn November 29, 2024, AES Ohio filed a new distribution rate case with the PUCO. The investments reflected in the distribution rate case include investments to enhance the safety, reliability, and resilience of the distribution system. Among other matters, the application requests: (i) an increase to its annual distribution revenue requirement of $235 million, which incorporates certain investments that are currently recovered through the Distribution Investment Rider; (ii) a return on equity of 10.95% and a cost of long-term debt of 4.49% on a distribution rate base of $1.3 billion and based on a capital structure of 53.87% equity and 46.13% long-term debt; and (iii) a date certain of September 30, 2024 and a test period of June 1, 2024 – May 31, 2025. The rate case application also includes a proposal for increased tree-trimming expenses. AES Ohio proposed an evidentiary hearing be held beginning June 2, 2025; however, the PUCO has not yet established a procedural schedule for the proceeding.\nDevelopment Strategy \n— Planned construction projects primarily relate to new investments in and upgrades to AES Ohio's transmission and distribution system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions, load forecasts, legislative and regulatory developments, and changing environmental standards, among other factors.\nAES Ohio is projecting to spend an estimated $1.3 billion on capital projects from 2025 through 2027, which includes expected spending under AES Ohio's Smart Grid Phase 1 and Phase 2 described above, as well as other transmission and distribution additions and improvements.\nAES El Salvador \nBusiness Description \n— AES El Salvador is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies operating in El Salvador (CAESS, CLESA, EEO and DEUSEM). AES El Salvador's territory covers 77% of the country and accounted for 4,499 GWh of the market energy sales during 2024. AES El Salvador owns and operates four solar farms, Opico Power, Moncagua, and Metapan with 4 MW, 3 MW and 15 MW of capacity, respectively; Meanguera del Golfo, a solar and battery storage facility with 1 MW capacity; AES Nejapa, a biomass power plant with 6 MW capacity; and 50% of Bosforo and Cuscatlan Solar, solar farms with 100 MW and 10 MW capacity, respectively. The energy produced by these solar farms is fully contracted by AES' utilities in El Salvador.\n In addition, AES El Salvador offers customers non-regulated services such as energy trading, electromechanical construction, O&M of electrical assets, EPC, pole rental, and tax collection for municipalities. \nKey Financial Drivers \n— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\noperational performance; \n•\nregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n•\nvariability in energy demand driven by weather; and\n•\nthe impact of fuel oil prices on energy tariff prices, which affect cash flow due to a three-month delay in the pass-through of energy costs to the tariffs charged to customers.\nDevelopment Strategy \n— In order to explore new business opportunities, AES El Salvador created AES \n29 | 2024 Annual Report\nSoluciones, an LED public lighting service provider and the main commercial and industrial solar photovoltaic EPC provider in the country. Electromobilty is also being promoted by AES Soluciones through a partnership with Blink Charger in order to design and deploy a private network of electric chargers throughout the country. AES Next, Ltda de C.V. is the O&M services provider for the Bosforo project, as well as a developer of solar MW in El Salvador. Furthermore, the four distribution companies operated by AES El Salvador started a digitization and modernization initiative as part of the development, sustainability, and growth strategy of the business.\n30 | 2024 Annual Report\n(1) \nNon-GAAP measure.

In Chile, AES is the second largest generation operator in terms of installed capacity with 3,685 MW, excluding energy storage, and has a market share of approximately 10% as of December 31, 2024. In addition, AES Chile has 451 MW of energy storage systems in operation. \nIn Chile, AES owns a diversified generation portfolio in terms of geography, technology, customers, and energy resources. Our generation plants are located near the principal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso, and Antofagasta. Our diverse generation portfolio provides flexibility for the management of contractual obligations with customers, provides backup energy to the spot market, and facilitates operations under a variety of market and hydrological conditions. \nAES Andes' Green Blend strategy aims to reduce carbon intensity and incorporate renewable energy to extend our existing conventional PPAs. This strategy de-links our PPAs from legacy fossil resources, grows our renewable energy portfolio, and delivers a competitive, reliable energy solution. In line with the Green Blend strategy, AES Andes has committed to not build additional coal-based power plants and to advance the \n33 | 2024 Annual Report\ndevelopment of new renewables projects, including the implementation of BESS and other technological innovations that will provide greater flexibility and reliability to the system.\nAES Andes currently has long-term contracts with an average remaining term of approximately 11 years with unregulated customers, such as mining and industrial companies, mainly with pricing indexed to CPI. \nIn addition to energy payments, AES also receives capacity payments to compensate for availability during periods of peak demand. The grid operator, Coordinador Electrico Nacional (\"CEN\"), annually determines the capacity requirements for each power plant. The capacity price is fixed semiannually by the National Energy Commission and indexed to CPI and other relevant indices.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \n—\n \nHedging strategies at AES Chile limit volatility to the underlying financial drivers. In addition, financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nspot market prices (largely impacted by dry hydrology scenarios, forced outages, and international fuel prices);\n•\nchanges in current regulatory rulings altering the ability to pass through or recover certain costs;\n•\nfluctuations of the Chilean peso;\n•\ntax policy changes; and\n•\nlegislation promoting renewable energy and/or more restrictive regulations on thermal generation assets\n.\nDecarbonization Strategy \n— The Chilean government’s decarbonization plan includes the complete retirement of the SEN coal fleet by the end of 2040 and carbon neutrality by 2050. Following the issuance of Supreme Decree Number 42 on December 26, 2020 by the Ministry of Energy and per the disconnection and termination agreement signed with the Chilean government in June 2019, AES Andes accelerated the retirement plans of its Ventanas 1 and Ventanas 2 coal-fired units, disconnecting them from the SEN as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On April 15, 2024, AES Andes also definitively disconnected the coal-fired generation units Norgener 1 and Norgener 2, with an installed capacity of 276 MW, from the SEN.\nIn July 2021, AES Andes committed to the shutdown of coal-fired operations at its Ventanas 3, Ventanas 4, Angamos 1, and Angamos 2 units as early as January 1, 2025, once the safety, sufficiency, and competitiveness of the system allows it, which has not yet occurred. In December 2024, the Company signed an agreement to sell its entire ownership interest in Ventanas, a 537 MW coal-fired plant located in the center of Chile. The transaction closed on January 13, 2025. The remaining Angamos units have an installed capacity of 558 MW and have publicly announced phase-out plans in line with the Company’s decarbonization strategy.\nDevelopment Strategy\n — In Chile, AES is committed to reducing the carbon intensity of the Chilean power grid and plans to increase the renewable energy capacity in its portfolio. As part of this commitment, AES Chile is building wind, solar, and battery projects to supply AES Andes' agreements with its main mining customers. \nIn total, the pipeline in Chile currently includes 5.8 GW under development at different stages and geographical locations. Within this portfolio, the Company has made significant progress in the development of non-conventional renewable energy (\"NCRE\") projects that are already contracted. Several projects are being developed in the Antofagasta region: the Pampas hybrid project (120 MW wind, 160 MW solar + 229 MW-3hr), the Cristales solar power plant (187 MW + 267 MW-3hr), and the Arenales standalone BESS project (300 MW-3hr).\nU.S. Conventional Generation \nBusiness Description \n— In the U.S., we own a conventional generation portfolio. The principal markets and locations where we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the California Independent System Operator (\"CAISO\") and Puerto Rico. AES Southland, operating in the CAISO, is our most significant generation business. In 2023, the Company closed on an agreement to terminate the PPA for the Warrior Run coal-fired power plant, which continued providing capacity through May 2024 before ending commercial operations.\nMany of our non-renewable U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability. Any change in availability has a direct impact on financial performance. Some plants are eligible for availability bonuses if they meet certain requirements. Coal and natural gas are used as the primary fuels. Coal prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas prices are generally set domestically. Price variations for these fuels can change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation businesses. \n34 | 2024 Annual Report\nOur non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators as defined under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, amending the Public Utility Holding Company Act (“PUHCA”). These businesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the Energy Policy Act and FERC's regulations, approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry, and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. \nThe U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the RTOs, non-profit corporations that operate the regional transmission grid and maintain organized markets for electricity. These rules, for the most part, govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A.—\nRisk Factors\n for additional discussion on U.S. regulatory matters.\nAES Southland\nBusiness Description \n— AES Southland is one of the largest generation operators in California by aggregate installed capacity, with an installed gross capacity of 2,823 MW at the end of 2024. The four coastal power plants comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an important role in integrating the increasing amounts of renewable generation resources in California. The AES Southland Energy Infrastructure assets are composed of two once-through cooling (\"OTC\") power plants and two combined cycle gas-fired generation facilities. This critical infrastructure is uniquely situated to support California in its transition to renewables with baseload gas-fired generation sited at high-demand points of interconnection within the Los Angeles Basin.\nSouthland \n— Southland comprises AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES Alamitos, LLC (\"Southland OTC units\"). Commencing on January 1, 2024, the Southland OTC units are contracted through Standby Capacity Purchase Agreements with the California Department of Water Resources (“California DWR”), an agency of the State of California, as part of the Electricity Supply Strategic Reliability Reserve Program (“Strategic Reserve”) established under California Assembly Bill 205. Under these agreements, California DWR is purchasing each facility’s available capacity for a three-year term. \nThe Southland OTC units are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. The units are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. AES Southland's current plan is to comply with the SWRCB OTC Policy by shutting down and permanently retiring all remaining generating units that utilize OTC by the compliance dates included in the OTC Policy. See \nUnited States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations\n—\nCooling Water Intake\n for further discussion of AES Southland’s plans regarding the OTC Policy.\nSouthland Energy \n— AES Huntington Beach Energy, LLC and AES Alamitos Energy, LLC, (collectively \"Southland Energy\") each operate under 20-year tolling agreements with Southern California Edison (\"SCE\") to provide 1,387 MW of combined cycle gas-fired generation (through 2040).\nThe contracts are Resource Adequacy Purchase Agreements (“RAPAs”) with annual energy tolling put options. If Southland Energy exercises the annual put option, all capacity, energy and ancillary services will be sold to SCE in exchange for a monthly energy and fixed capacity payment that covers fixed operating cost, debt service, and return on capital. In addition, SCE will reimburse variable costs and provide the natural gas. Southland Energy may exercise the annual put option for any contract year by delivering notice of such exercise to SCE at least one year before the start of such contract year, and no more than two years before the start of any contract year. If the annual put options are not exercised, Southland Energy is required to sell the physical output of the combined cycle gas-fired generation units to AES Integrated Energy. AES Integrated Energy is required to bid energy into the California ISO market. AES Integrated Energy enters into commodity swap contracts to economically hedge price variability inherent in electricity sales arrangements. Southland Energy continues to receive the monthly fixed capacity payments for periods when the put option is not exercised.\nKey Financial Drivers \n— AES Southland's availability is one of the most important drivers of operations, along with market demand and prices for gas and electricity.\n35 | 2024 Annual Report\nAES Puerto Rico\nBusiness Description\n — AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a 524 MW coal-fired cogeneration plant representing approximately 9% of the installed capacity in Puerto Rico.

Private companies operate in all three segments, and generators can enter into PPAs to sell energy to regulated and unregulated customers, as well as to other generators in the spot market.\nChile operates in a single power market, referred to as the SEN, which is managed by the grid operator CEN. The SEN has an installed capacity of 35,461 MW and represents 99% of the installed generation capacity of the country.\nCEN coordinates all generation and transmission companies in the SEN. CEN minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, while maximizing service quality and reliability requirements. CEN dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available cost. In the south-central region of the SEN, thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill demand not satisfied by hydroelectric, solar, and wind output and is critical to provide reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry hydrological conditions in the highest demand area of the SEN. In the northern region of the SEN, which includes the Atacama Desert, thermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel, and LNG, are indexed to international prices. In 2024, the installed capacity in the Chilean market was composed of thermoelectric (34%), solar (30%), hydroelectric (21%), wind (14%), and other fuel (1%) generation. \nHydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's installed capacity. Precipitation and snow melt impact hydrological conditions in Chile. Rain occurs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from September to December. These factors affect dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants, thereby influencing spot market prices. \nThe Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels.\nAll generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Customers whose connected demand capacity is higher than 5 MW are excluded from the regulated market and are referred to as unregulated customers. Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 5 MW can opt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase all electricity under contracts. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term basis at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile are denominated in USD, although payments are made in Chilean pesos.\nDominican Republic\nThe Dominican Republic energy market is a decentralized industry consisting of generation, transmission, and distribution businesses. Generation companies can earn revenue through short-term and long-term PPAs, ancillary services, and a competitive wholesale generation market. All generation, transmission, and distribution companies are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law.\nTwo main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law:\n•\nThe National Energy Commission drafts and coordinates the legal framework and regulatory legislation. They propose and adopt policies and procedures to implement best practices, support the proper functioning and development of the energy sector, and promote investment.\n•\nThe Superintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring compliance with legal provisions, rules, and technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization of electricity. They monitor behavior in the electricity market in order to prevent monopolistic practices.\nIn addition to the two agencies responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to end users.\nThe Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with 5,914 MW of installed capacity, composed of thermal (66%), solar (16%), hydroelectric (11%), and wind (7%) generation.\n41 | 2024 Annual Report\nEl Salvador\nEl Salvador's national electric market is composed of generation, distribution, transmission, and marketing businesses, a market and system operator, and regulatory agencies. The operation of the transmission system and the wholesale market is based on production costs with a marginal economic model that rewards efficiency and allows investors to have guaranteed profits, while end users receive affordable rates. The energy sector is governed by the General Electricity Law, which establishes two regulatory entities responsible for monitoring its compliance: \n•\nThe National Energy and Hydrocarbons Direction is the highest authority on energy policy and strategy, and the coordinating body for the different energy sectors. One of its main objectives is to promote investment in non-conventional renewable sources to diversify the energy matrix.\n•\nThe General Superintendence of Electricity and Telecommunications regulates the market and sets consumer prices, and, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, developed the tariff calculation originally applicable from 2023 until 2027.\nAES El Salvador distribution rates are regulated by SIGET and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. AES El Salvador is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution services as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, capital structure, and cost of capital. El Salvador has a national electric grid that interconnects directly with Guatemala and Honduras, allowing transactions with all Central American countries. The sector has approximately 2,534 MW of installed capacity, composed of thermal (53%), hydroelectric (25%), biomass (11%), solar (9%), and wind (2%) generation.\nBulgaria\nThe electricity sector in Bulgaria is regulated by the Bulgarian Energy Act, which was amended in November 2023 and May 2024 to fulfill a commitment by Bulgaria to the European Commission to fully liberalize its electricity market by the end of 2025. The Bulgarian electricity market allows both regulated and competitive segments until the end of 2025. From 2026 onwards, it is expected that the regulated segment will cease to exist. NEK will retain its capacity as the public provider of electricity until the end of June 2025, under which NEK acts as a single buyer and seller for all regulated transactions on the market. From July 2025 onwards, Bulgarian distribution companies serving the regulated market will source their electricity needs exclusively from the competitive segment of the market. Electricity outside the regulated market trades on one of the platforms of the Independent Bulgarian Electricity Exchange day-ahead market, intra-day market, or bilateral contracts market. \nBulgaria’s power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, universal access to the grid, and numerous cross-border connections with neighboring countries. In addition, it plays an important role in the energy balance in the southeast European region.\nBulgaria has 15,307 MW of installed capacity enabling the country to meet and exceed domestic demand and export energy. Installed capacity is primarily composed of thermal (34%), solar (26%), hydro (21%), and nuclear (14%) generation. \nPanama\nThe Panamanian power sector is composed of three distinct operating business units: generation, distribution, and transmission. Generators can enter into short-term and long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into backup supply contracts with each other. Outside of PPAs, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market. Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity.\nThree main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law:\n•\nThe National Secretary of Energy in Panama (\"SNE\") has the responsibilities of planning, supervising, and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. The SNE proposes laws and regulations to the executive agencies that regulate the procurement of energy and hydrocarbons for the country.\n•\nThe National Authority of Public Services (\"ASEP\") is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the regulations, control and oversight of public services in Panama, including electricity, the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities, and the companies that provide such services.\n•\nThe National Dispatch Center (\"CND\") is in charge of the operation of the system and the management of the electricity market. They are responsible for implementing the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The National Dispatch Center's objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintain the reliability and security of the electric power system. Short-term power prices are \n42 | 2024 Annual Report\ndetermined on an hourly basis by the last dispatched generating unit. Physical generation of energy is determined as a result of the optimization of the economic dispatch regardless of contractual arrangements.\nPanama's current total installed capacity is 4,910 MW, composed of thermal (43%), hydroelectric (38%), solar (12%), and wind (7%) generation.\nMexico\nMexico's \nmain electrical system is called the National Interconnected System, which geographically covers an area from Puerto Peñasco, Sonora to Cozumel, Quintana Roo. Mexico also has three isolated electrical systems: (1) the Baja California Interconnected System, which is interconnected with the western interconnection; (2) the Baja California Sur Interconnected System; and (3) the Mulegé Interconnected System. All three are isolated from the SIN and from each other.\n The Mexican power industry \ncomprises the activities of generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization segments, considering transmission and distribution to be exclusive state services.\nIn addition to the Ministry of Energy, three main agencies are responsible for regulating market agents and their activities, monitoring compliance with laws and regulations, and surveillance of operational compliance and management of the wholesale electricity market:\n•\nThe Energy Regulatory Commission is responsible for the establishment of directives, orders, methodologies, and standards to regulate the electric and fuel markets, as well as granting permits.\n•\nThe National Center for Energy Control, as an ISO, is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity market, transmission and distribution infrastructure, planning network developments, guaranteeing open access to network infrastructure, executing competitive mechanisms to cover regulated demand, and setting transmission charges.\n•\nThe Electricity Federal Commission (\"CFE\") owns the transmission and distribution grids and is also the country's basic supplier. CFE is the offtaker for IPP generators, and together with its own power units has more than 50% of the current generation market share.\nMexico has an installed capacity of 89 GW, composed of thermal (64%), hydroelectric (14%), wind (8%), solar (8%), and other fuel (6%) generation.\nArgentina\nArgentina has one main power system, the SADI, which serves 91% of the country. As of December 31, 2024, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 43,351 MW. The SADI's installed capacity is composed of thermoelectric (58%), hydroelectric (24%), wind (10%), nuclear (4%), and solar (4%) generation. \nThermoelectric generation in the SADI is fueled primarily by natural gas. However, scarcity of natural gas during winter periods (June to August) due to transport constraints results in the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The SADI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants. Hydrological conditions impact reservoir water levels and largely influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants and, therefore, influence market costs. Precipitation in Argentina occurs principally from May to October. \nThe Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission, and distribution. The wholesale electric market is comprised of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies, and large customers who are permitted to trade electricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the spot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is responsible for dispatch coordination. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the Secretariat of Energy regulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. In Argentina, there is a tolling scheme in which the regulator establishes prices for electricity and defines fuel reference prices. For the energy sold in the spot market, generators are compensated for fixed costs and non-fuel variable costs, under prices mainly denominated in Argentine pesos and CAMMESA is in charge of providing the natural gas and liquid fuels required by the generation companies, except for coal. For the energy sold under PPAs (as Energía PLUS from TermoAndes) the generators buy their required fuel at a reference price established by the regulator. As a result, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation.\nThe expansion of renewables capacity in the system is promoted by allowing new power plants to sign contracts either with CAMMESA through the RenovAr program or directly by trading energy in the private market.\nDuring 2024, although the government increased prices to the end user, subsidies and the system deficit also increased. By December 2024, distribution companies recovered an average 60% of the total cost of the system.\n43 | 2024 Annual Report\nIn past years, AES Argentina contributed certain accounts receivable to fund the construction of three power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years after the commercial operation date of the related plant. In 2020, FONINVEMEM I and II installments were fully repaid and in 2021 the ownership interests in Termoeléctrica San Martín and Termoeléctrica Manuel Belgrano were defined after the incorporation of the National Government as majority shareholder. The transfer of the power plants to these companies has not yet occurred. FONINVEMEM III is related to Termoeléctrica Guillermo Brown, which began operations in April 2016, and the installments are still being collected. AES Argentina will receive a pro rata ownership interest in this plant, which shall not be greater than 30%, once the accounts receivables have been fully repaid.\nIn 2023 and 2024, the Argentine peso devalued against the USD by approximately 78% and 22%, respectively, and Argentina’s economy continued to be highly inflationary. Since September 2019, currency controls have been established to govern the devaluation of the Argentine peso and keep Argentine central bank reserves at acceptable levels.\nColombia\nElectricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN, which encompasses one-third of Colombia's territory and provides electricity to 97% of the country's population. As of December 31, 2024, the SIN's installed capacity was 21,431 MW, composed of hydroelectric (62%), thermal (29%), and other renewables (9%) generation. The marked seasonal variations in Colombia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2024, 65% of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric plants.\nThe electricity sector in Colombia operates under a competitive market framework for the generation and sale of electricity, and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution of electricity. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by Colombian laws and CREG, the Colombian regulating entity for energy and gas. Other government entities have a role in the electricity industry, including the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which defines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge of overseeing utility companies; and the Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which is in charge of expansion planning of the generation and transmission network. \nThe generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-term price or under bilateral contracts with other participants, including distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at freely negotiated prices. The National Dispatch Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available generating units.\nThe expansion of the system is supported by two schemes: i) reliability charge auctions where firm energy commitments are focused on conventional technology power plants, and ii) auctions of long-term energy contracts assigned for periods of 15 years aimed at non-conventional renewable resources.\nIn addition to the reliability charge, the Colombian electricity sector has an additional reliability mechanism known as the risk of shortage statute, established by CREG resolution 026 of 2014. This mechanism is triggered under specific critical hydrological conditions, during which certain reservoirs are utilized to conserve water, thereby increasing thermal dispatch. It was first triggered during late September 2024 until late November 2024.\nVietnam\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade in Vietnam is primarily responsible for formulating a program to restructure the power industry, developing the electricity market, and promulgating electricity market regulations. The fuel supply is owned by the government through Vinacomin, a state-owned entity, and PetroVietnam. \nThe Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central, and South), with total installed capacity of approximately 85 GW. The fuel mix in Vietnam is composed primarily of coal (31%), hydroelectric (29%) and renewables generation, including solar, wind, and biomass (27%). EVN, the national utility, owns 37% of installed generation capacity.\nVietnam is implementing a multi-step process to create a competitive electricity market. The first step taken in 2012 was to separate the generation segment of EVN into different joint-stock companies and to create a Competitive Power Market which was effective until 2019. In this market, all generation companies bid into the market and sell to a single buyer which is also owned by EVN. The next step taken in 2019 was to replace the Competitive Power Market with the Electricity Wholesale Market, in which there are several buyers, called EVN Power Corporations, all of which are subsidiaries of EVN. The final step, which is yet to be implemented, is the creation of the Electricity Retail Market, in which non-EVN-owned buyers would be allowed, and direct sales and \n44 | 2024 Annual Report\npurchases between retailers and generators would be feasible. The Mong Duong 2 power plant is a BOT plant and does not directly participate in the electricity market. The offtaker bids Mong Duong 2’s tariff into the market on its behalf.\nAt the end of November 2024, a new electricity law was passed by the National Assembly. The new law provides for a comprehensive reform of the legal framework in the power and energy sector of Vietnam after two decades under the current electricity law of 2004. It provides an improved legal environment for the energy sector, including but not limited to imported LNG power, green hydrogen and ammonia, offshore wind, nuclear power, low-emission conversion, emergency power projects, minimum long-term contracted electricity output, DPPA, and a fuel cost pass-through mechanism. \nPuerto Rico\nPuerto Rico has a single electric grid managed by PREPA, a state-owned entity that provides virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits, and distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. Since June 2021, PREPA has contracted LUMA Energy to manage the transmission, distribution, and commercialization activities. The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau is the main regulatory body. The bureau approves wholesale and retail rates, sets efficiency and interconnection standards, and oversees PREPA's compliance with Puerto Rico's renewables portfolio standard.\nPuerto Rico's electricity is 93% produced by thermal plants (48% from petroleum, 37% from natural gas, and 8% from coal), while the remaining 7% is supplied by renewable sources (wind and solar).\nJordan\nThe Jordan electricity transmission market is a single-buyer model with the state-owned National Electric Power Company (\"NEPCO\") responsible for transmission. NEPCO generally enters into long-term PPAs with IPPs to fulfill energy procurement requests from distribution utilities.\nU.S. Utilities\nSee Item 1.—\nBusiness—Segments—Utilities \nfor further discussion of the energy markets and regulatory environment of our utilities in the U.S. \n—\n AES Indiana and AES Ohio.\n45 | 2024 Annual Report\nEnvironmental and Land-Use Regulations\nThe Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion residuals), and certain air emissions, such as SO\n2\n, NO\nX\n, particulate matter, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our U.S. or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.—\nRisk Factors\n—\nOur operations are subject to significant government regulation and could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes; Several of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR; Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations;\n and\n Concerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses\n in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws and regulations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1.—\nBusiness\n of this Form 10-K under the applicable SBUs.\nMany of the countries in which the Company does business have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as combined fluidized bed boilers and advanced gas turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO\n2\n emissions and selective catalytic reduction for NO\nx\n emissions.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. The Company may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would not be materially affected.\nVarious licenses, permits, and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions, or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3.\n—\nLegal Proceedings\n in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action.\nUnited States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations\nIn the United States, numerous environmental laws and regulations regulate emissions of SO\n2\n, NO\nX\n, particulate matter, GHGs, mercury, hazardous air pollutants, water discharges, waste management, and species and habitat protections. Certain applicable rules are discussed in further detail below.\nCSAPR — \nCSAPR addresses the \"good neighbor\" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state’s nonattainment of, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The CSAPR is implemented in part through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA.\nOn June 5, 2023, the EPA published a final Federal Implementation Plan (\"FIP\") to address air quality impacts with respect to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. The rule establishes a revised CSAPR NO\nx\n Ozone Season Group 3 trading program for 22 states, including Indiana and Maryland, and became effective during 2023 and includes enhancements to the revised Group 3 trading program. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting a stay of the EPA’s 2023 FIP pending resolution of legal challenges to the FIP.\n46 | 2024 Annual Report\nOn November 6, 2024, the EPA published in the Federal Register an Interim Final Rule in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s stay of its FIP addressing interstate transport for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards. The effective date is November 6, 2024. The Interim Final Rule stays the effectiveness of the Good Neighbor FIP and revises the CSAPR regulations to continue application of the states’ respective trading programs. The updated emissions budgets will apply for the entirety of the 2024 ozone season and the EPA is expected to adjust quantities of updated allowances to reflect pre-stay transactions. It is too early to determine the impact of this final rule, but it may result in the need to purchase additional allowances or make operational adjustments.\nWhile the Company's additional CSAPR compliance costs to date have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material.\nNew Source Review (\"NSR\") — \nThe NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major emission sources, such as electric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR requirements if they meet the routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (\"RMRR\") exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty and significant litigation regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. Over the past several years, the EPA has filed suits against coal-fired power plant owners and issued NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.—\nLegal Proceedings\n in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including an NOV issued by the EPA against AES Indiana concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA. If NSR requirements are imposed on any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nNew Source Performance Standards for Stationary Combustion Turbines - \nOn November 22, 2024, the EPA released a prepublication version of a proposed rule that would revise the NSPS regulating NO\nx\n and SO\n2\n from certain new, modified, and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines. The proposal would establish more stringent NO\nx\n emissions standards and would retain the existing SO\n2\n standards. The revised standards would apply to affected sources that begin construction, modification, or reconstruction after the date the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. We cannot predict the possible outcome or potential impacts of this matter at this time. \nRegional Haze Rule — \nThe EPA's \"Regional Haze Rule\" established timelines for states to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States by establishing reasonable progress goals toward meeting a national goal of natural visibility conditions in Class I areas by the year 2064 through a series of state implementation plans (SIPs), which may result in additional emissions control requirements for electric generating units. SIPs for the first planning period (through 2018) did not result in material impact to AES facilities. For all future SIP planning periods, states must evaluate whether additional emissions reduction measures may be needed to continue making reasonable progress toward natural visibility conditions. The deadline for submittal of the SIP covering the second planning period was July 31, 2021. To date, none of the states in which we operate have submitted plans that identify potential impacts to Company facilities. However, we cannot predict the possible outcome or potential impacts of this matter at this time.\nNAAQS — \nUnder the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment, including ozone, particulate matter, NO\nX\n, and SO\n2\n, which result from fossil-fuel combustion. Areas meeting the NAAQS are designated \"attainment areas\" while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered \"nonattainment areas.\" Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at five-year intervals.\nBased on the current and potential future ambient air standards, certain of the states in which the Company's subsidiaries operate have determined or will be required to determine whether certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required to modify their SIPs to detail how the states will attain or maintain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the applicable state environmental regulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulate matter, NO\nX\n, or SO\n2\n. The compliance costs of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries could be material.\n47 | 2024 Annual Report\nMercury and Air Toxics Standard — \nIn April 2012, the EPA’s rule to establish maximum achievable control technology standards for hazardous air pollutants regulated under the CAA emitted from coal and oil-fired electric utilities, known as “MATS”, became effective and AES facilities implemented measures to comply, as applicable.\nOn May 7, 2024, the EPA published a final rule to revise MATS for coal and oil-fired electric generating units (\"EGUs\") which lowers certain emissions limits and revises certain other aspects of MATS. The May 2024 MATS revision rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 4, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications. It is too early to determine the potential impacts of this proposal rule.\nFurther rulemakings and/or proceedings are possible; however, in the meantime, MATS remains in effect. We currently cannot predict the outcome of the regulatory or judicial process, or its impact, if any, on our MATS compliance planning or ultimate costs.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions — \nIn January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources, including a pre-construction permitting program for certain new construction or major modifications, known as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\"PSD\"). If future modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources become subject to PSD for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements and the cost of compliance with such requirements may be material.\nOn May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final NSPS requiring carbon capture and sequestration for new and reconstructed baseload stationary combustion turbines, among other requirements. The EPA did not finalize revisions to the NSPS for newly constructed or reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units as proposed in 2018. The NSPS could have an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations. \nOn July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy (\"ACE\") Rule which would have established CO\n2 \nemission rules for existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d) and would have replaced the EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan Rule (\"CPP\"). However, on January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE Rule. Subsequently, on June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, holding that the “generation shifting” approach in the CPP exceeded the authority granted to the EPA by Congress under Section 111(d) of the CAA. As a result of the June 30, 2022 Supreme Court decision, on October 27, 2022, the D.C. Circuit issued a partial mandate, holding pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance. \nOn May 23, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule that would vacate the ACE Rule, establish emissions guidelines in the form of CO\n2\n emissions limitations for certain existing EGUs and would require states to develop State Plans that establish standards of performance for such EGUs that are at least as stringent as the EPA’s emissions guidelines. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule regulating GHGs from existing EGUs pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and effective on July 8, 2024. Existing EGUs are those that were constructed prior to January 8, 2014. Depending on various EGU-specific factors, the bases of emissions guidelines for natural gas-fired units include the use of uniform fuels and routine methods of operation and maintenance and the bases of emissions guidelines for coal-fired units include 40% natural gas co-firing or carbon capture and sequestration with 90% capture of CO\n2 \ndepending on the date that coal operations cease. Specific standards for performance for EGUs will be established through a State Plan (or a Federal Plan if the state of Indiana were to not submit an approvable plan). The May 2024 rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 16, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications.\nIt is too early to determine the potential impact of the proposed rule and the results of further proceedings and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remain uncertain, but could be material.\nOn January 20, 2021, President Biden signed and submitted an instrument for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement effective February 19, 2021. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” directing the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The international community has and continues to gather annually for the Conference to the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate.\nAs such, there is some uncertainty with respect to the impact of GHG rules. The GHG BACT requirements will not apply at least until we construct a new major source or make a major modification of an existing major source, and the NSPS for new EGUs will not require us to comply with an emissions standard until we construct a new electric generating unit. We do not have any planned major modifications of an existing source or plans to construct a new major source at this time which are expected to be subject to these regulations. Furthermore, the EPA, \n48 | 2024 Annual Report\nstates, and other utilities are still evaluating potential impacts of the GHG regulations in our industry. In light of these uncertainties, we cannot predict the impact of the EPA’s current and future GHG regulations on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nDue to the future uncertainty of these regulations and associated litigation, we cannot at this time determine the impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but we believe the cost to comply with a new Section 111(d) Rule, should it be implemented in a prior or a substantially similar form, could be material. The GHG NSPS for new EGUs remains in effect at this time, and, absent further action from the EPA that rescinds or substantively revises the NSPS, it could impact any Company plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCooling Water Intake — \nThe Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. In particular, the Company's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA effective in 2014 that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at power plants and other facilities. These standards require affected facilities to choose among seven best technology available (\"BTA\") options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, certain facilities must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms. It is possible that this process, which includes permitting and public input, could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.\nCertain AES Southland OTC units were required to be retired to provide interconnection capacity and/or emissions credits prior to startup of new (air cooled) generating units, and the remaining AES OTC generating units in California have been or will be shut down and permanently retired by the applicable OTC Policy compliance dates for the respective units. The SWRCB OTC Policy currently requires the shutdown and permanent retirement of the remaining OTC generating units at AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES Alamitos, LLC by December 31, 2026, as extended in support of grid reliability. This extension compliance date is contingent upon the facilities participating in the Strategic Reserve established by AB 205.\nPower plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b) regulations and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWater Discharges — \nThe concept of Waters of the United States (\"WOTUS\") defines the geographic reach and authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA (together, the \"Agencies\") to regulate streams, wetlands, and other water bodies under the CWA. There have been multiple Supreme Court decisions and dueling regulatory definitions over the past several years concerning the appropriate standard for how to properly determine whether a wetland or stream that is not navigable is considered a WOTUS. On May 25, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a decision (“Decision”) in the case of \nSackett v. Environmental Protection Agency\n, addressing the definition of WOTUS with regards to the CWA. This decision provides a standard that substantially restricts the Agencies' ability to regulate certain types of wetlands and streams. Specifically, under this decision, wetlands that do not have a continuous surface connection with traditional interstate navigable water are not federally jurisdictional.\nOn September 8, 2023, the Agencies published final rule amendments in the Federal Register to amend the final “Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’” rule. This final rule amendment conforms the definition to the definition adopted in the Decision. The Agencies have amended key aspects of the regulatory text to conform the rule to the Decision. It is too early to determine whether the outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to rules interpreting federal jurisdiction over WOTUS may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash, and more stringent effluent \n49 | 2024 Annual Report\nlimitations for flue gas desulfurization wastewater. AES Indiana Petersburg has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and wastewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in advance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gas desulfurization wastewater. Following the 2019 U.S. Court of Appeals vacatur and remand of portions of the 2015 ELG rule related to leachate and legacy water, on March 29, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule revising the 2020 Reconsideration Rule. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published a final rule which became effective on July 8, 2024. The final rule established more stringent best available technology limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate and established a new set of definitions and new limits for combustion residual leachate and legacy wastewater. The May 2024 rule is subject to legal challenges. On October 10, 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court denied stay applications. It is too early to determine whether any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the \nHawaii Wildlife Fund v. County of Maui\n case related to whether a CWA permit is required when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters through a nonpoint source, such as groundwater. The Court held that discharges to groundwater require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. A number of legal cases relevant to determination of \"functional equivalent\" are ongoing in various jurisdictions. On November 27, 2023, the EPA issued a draft guidance addressing how the Supreme Court decision would be applied to the NPDES permit program as it relates to functional equivalent discharge. It is too early to determine whether the Supreme Court decision or the result of litigation to \"functional equivalent\" may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWaste Management — \nOn October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating CCR landfills and CCR surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements, and post-closure care. The 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (\"WIN Act\") includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. On February 20, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in states without approved CCR permit programs. If this rule is finalized before Indiana or Puerto Rico establishes a state-level CCR permit program, AES CCR units in those locations could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from the EPA. The EPA has indicated that it will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule, which is ongoing. On January 11, 2022, the EPA released the first in a series of proposed and final determinations regarding CCR Part A Rule demonstrations and compliance-related letters notifying certain facilities of their compliance obligations under the federal CCR regulations. The determinations and letters include interpretations regarding implementation of the CCR Rule. On April 8, 2022, petitions for review were filed challenging these EPA actions. The petitions are consolidated in \nElectric Energy, Inc. v. EPA. \nIt is too early to determine the direct or indirect impact of these letters or any determinations that may be made.\nOn May 8, 2024, the EPA published final revisions to the CCR rule which expand the scope of CCR units regulated by the CCR Rule to include legacy surface impoundments, inactive surface impoundments, and CCR management units. The May 8, 2024 revisions to the CCR Rule are currently subject to legal challenges and on November 1, 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court denied a motion to stay these revisions to the CCR Rule. On November 5, 2024, an application for stay of the CCR Rule revisions was filed with the United States Supreme Court, which was denied by the Court on December 11, 2024. It is too early to determine the potential impact from these revisions to the CCR Rule.\nThe CCR rule, current or proposed amendments to the federal CCR rule or state/territory CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring data, or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. AES Indiana would seek recovery of any resulting expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we would be successful in this regard.\nTrump Administration Actions Affecting Environmental Regulations — \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled “\nUnleashing American Energy\n” directing Agencies to, among other tasks, review regulations issued under the prior Administration to determine whether they should be suspended, revised, or rescinded. The Trump Administration also issued a Memorandum titled “\nRegulatory Freeze Pending Review\n” \n50 | 2024 Annual Report\ndirecting Agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing any rules until the Trump Administration has reviewed and approved those rules. These actions may have an impact on regulations and permitting processes that may affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nInternational Environmental Regulations\nChile\nChilean law requires all electricity generators to supply a certain portion of their total contractual obligations with NCRE. Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by building NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and small hydroelectric technology) or purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Non-compliance with the NCRE requirements will result in fines. AES Andes currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Andes' solar, wind, and biomass power plants. \nSince 2017, emissions of particulate matter, SO\n2\n, NO\nX\n, and CO\n2\n are monitored for plants with an installed capacity over 50 MW; these emissions are taxed. In the case of CO\n2\n, the tax is equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. Certain PPAs have clauses allowing the Company to pass the green tax costs to unregulated customers, while some distribution PPAs do not allow for the pass through of these costs. \nDuring 2022, new regulations associated with environmental monitoring requirements were published, including Law 21,455, which is the framework on climate change; the Ventanas power plant new Operational Plan; emission standards for back up generators; and recently enacted Law 21,505, which promotes electric energy storage and electromobility. \nDuring 2023, increasingly demanding environmental regulations have been issued, which will require adjustments in controls throughout the life cycle of any investment project, that is, in the development, construction and operation phase. Environmental prevention and management models must be adjusted to prevent behaviors that could be considered environmental crimes, as well as investments performed to comply with new regulatory standards. \nIn this context, the following regulations were enacted:\n•\nLaw No 21.595: Economic and Environmental Crimes Law, which includes the regulation of crimes of attacks against the environment, establishing effective prison sentences in addition to the financial responsibility of companies.\n•\nLaw No. 21,600 creates the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Service; and\n•\nDecree No. 1/2022 Establishes the Emission Standard for Artificial Lighting generated by outdoor lighting, which changes the level of applicability of its requirements, expanding its scope of application at the national level and contemplating some stricter limits for protected areas. \nIn the coming months the following regulations are expected to be published:\n•\nNew emission standards for thermoelectric power plants (standard under review since 2020);\n•\nNew noise emission standard for fixed sources (under review since 2019); \n•\nA modification to the System Regulations. \n•\nAmendments to a number of legal acts in order to strengthen the institutional framework for environmental protection and improve its effectiveness (Bulletin 16552-12);\n•\nA law that strengthens and improves the effectiveness of environmental regulation enforcement and compliance by the Superintendency of the Environment (Bulletin 16553-12); and\n•\nA law that establishes a framework law on sectoral authorizations and introduces changes to the legal entities that are indicated in it (Bulletin 16566-03).\nAES Andes monitors the evolution of these projects to analyze possible impacts on the business.\nBulgaria\nIn July 2020, the EU approved the Next Generation EU (\"NGEU\") recovery instrument, which aims at mitigating the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and making European economies and societies more sustainable. The main funding component of NGEU is the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (\"RRF\"). In November 2023, the European Commission approved an amended version of Bulgaria's Recovery and \n51 | 2024 Annual Report\nResilience Plan (\"RRP\") that describes the reforms and investments which Bulgaria wishes to make with the support of the RRF. In its RRP, Bulgaria commits to designing a coal phase-out plan aiming at retiring coal-fired power plants by 2038. \nArgentina\nArgentina has agreed to commitments made by the international community ratified in the Paris Agreement and in Law 27,270 passed in September 2016.\nIn October 2015, Law 27,191 was passed, seeking to create a successful framework for the development of renewable energy. This law set an objective of 8% renewable energy by 2017 and 20% by 2025 and also introduced tax exemptions for importing equipment used in the construction of renewable energy projects in addition to other tax benefits. This framework fostered AES Argentina's construction of Vientos Bonaerenses and Vientos Neuquinos power plants, which are fully contracted with public and private customers in the long term.\nIn December 2019, Law 27,520 established a minimum budget to grant adequate actions, instruments, and strategies to mitigate and adapt to global climate change effects in all national territories and created the National Office of Climate Change to designate private and public actors to design policies aiming to reduce greenhouse gases and to provide coordinated responses in sectors that are vulnerable to climate change impacts.\nAll AES Argentina plants are certified under international standards of Quality (ISO 9001), Safety and Health (ISO 45.001) and Environment (ISO 14001).\nOn July 8, 2024, the Argentine Government enacted the \"Ley de Bases y Puntos de Partida para la Libertad de los Argentinos\" (Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of the Argentine People), through decree 592/2024 published in the Official Gazette.\nThe \"Ley Bases\" declares a public emergency in administrative, economic, financial and energy matters for a term of one year, grants delegated powers to the President and contains a broad reform of the State in order to deregulate the economy, such as a labor reform and the implementation of the Incentive Regime for Large Investments, as well as the modification of several tax measures.\nIn addition, The Ministry of Energy published Resolution 150/2024 on July 10, that repeals regulations from previous years that imply excessive involvement of the National State and Cammesa in the operation and functioning of the wholesale electricity market (MEM). Based on the effective emergency situation recognized and declared, and based on the new regulations, the functions of the different state entities and public and private companies in the energy sector will be reviewed to achieve adequate supply.\nThrough Decree 1083/2024, Law No. 26,160 and Decree No. 805 of November 17, 2021 were repealed, which extended the emergency in indigenous lands until November 2025. It was argued that the suspension of evictions made productive and recreational activities difficult, in addition to promoting territorial conflicts.\nColombia\nDecree 1076 of 2015 established the current Environmental Licensing Scheme that defines the scope of the National Environmental Licensing Authority (\"ANLA\") for granting environmental licenses. In recent years, the Ministry of the Environment has generated regulations in connection with licenses, such as the biotic compensation methodology and guidance for presentation of environmental studies in 2018, and the regulation of minor changes to environmental licenses in 2022. \nIn 2023, the ANLA begun the review of the reference terms for environmental impact studies and has been working on a reform to the procedure for licensing process for non-conventional renewable energy projects. \nThe following is a summary of the environmental regulatory issues that were formalized in 2024:\n•\nRenewable energy projects with an installed capacity equal to or greater than 50 MW will be licensed by ANLA. Previously, the limit was 100 MW.\n•\nThe drafts of the new Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact Assessment for wind and solar projects and the new methodology for submitting environmental studies were issued. They are expected to be officially issued during the first quarter of 2025.\n•\nDecree 1275 of 2024 was issued, which establishes the environmental authority powers of indigenous communities in their territories.\n52 | 2024 Annual Report\nAt the end of 2023, AES Colombia obtained the environmental license, issued by the ANLA, for the 500 kV line to connect the Guajira pipeline projects. Currently, AES Colombia has obtained environmental licenses for 406 MW of wind projects in Guajira. The next step is to start the environmental licensing process for the JK4 wind project during the first quarter of 2025. \nCustomers \nWe sell to a wide variety of customers. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2024 total revenue. In our generation business, we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. Our utilities sell to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental sectors in a defined service area.\nHuman Capital Management\nAt AES, our people are instrumental to helping us meet the world’s energy needs. Supporting our people is a foundational value for AES. Our actions are grounded in the shared values that shape AES’ culture: Safety First, Highest Standards, and All Together. The AES Corporation is led and managed by our Chief Executive Officer and the Global Leadership Team with the guidance and oversight of our Board of Directors. Governance and standards for AES people are guided by the Chief Human Resources Officer, with input from members of the Global Leadership Team.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 9,100 full time/permanent employees. \nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 30% of our U.S. employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from 2026 to 2027. In addition, certain employees in non-U.S. locations were subject to collective bargaining agreements, representing approximately 50% of the non-U.S. workforce. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable.\nSafety\nAt AES, safety is one of our core values. Conducting safe operations at our facilities around the world, so that each person can return home safely, is the cornerstone of our daily activities and decisions. Safety efforts are led by our Chief Operating Officer and supported by safety committees that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety.\nAES has established a Safety Management System (“SMS”) Global Safety Standard that applies to all AES employees, as well as contractors working in AES facilities and construction projects. The SMS requires continuous safety performance monitoring, risk assessment, and performance of periodic integrated environmental, health, and safety audits. The SMS provides a consistent framework for all AES operational businesses and construction projects to set expectations for risk identification and reduction, measure performance, and drive continuous \n53 | 2024 Annual Report\nimprovements. The SMS standard is consistent with the ISO 45001 standard, and during 2024 approximately 53% of our locations (49% excluding sites no longer owned by AES as of December 31, 2024) have elected to formally certify their SMS to the ISO 45001 international standard. AES calculates lost time incident (“LTI”) rates for our employees and contractors based on OSHA standards, based on 200,000 labor hours, which equates to 100 workers who work 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. In 2024, there was a 39% decrease in LTI cases. In 2024, AES’ LTI Rate was 0.094 for AES People, 0.069 for operational contractors, and 0.037 for construction contractors. In 2024, the Company did not have any work-related fatalities.\nTalent\n \nWe believe AES’ success depends on its ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. The skills, experience, and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We have a comprehensive approach to managing our talent and developing our leaders in order to ensure our people have the right skills for today and tomorrow, whether that requires us to build new business models or leverage leading technologies.\nWe emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful by focusing on experience and exposure, as well as formal programs including our Trainee Program.\nCompensation\nAES’ executive compensation philosophy emphasizes pay-for-performance. Our incentive plans are designed to reward strong performance, with greater compensation paid when performance exceeds expectations and less compensation paid when performance falls below expectations. We invest significant time and resources to ensure our compensation programs are competitive and reward the performance of our people. Every year, AES people who are not part of a collective bargaining agreement are eligible for an annual merit-based salary increase. In addition, individuals are eligible for a salary increase if they receive a significant promotion. For non-collectively bargained employees at certain levels in the organization, we offer annual incentives (bonus) and long-term compensation to reinforce the alignment between AES' employees and AES.\nExecutive Officers \nThe following individuals are our executive officers:\nStephen Coughlin, \n53\n \nyears old, \nhas served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since October 2021.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor discussion of the Company's year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Item 7.\n—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nin our 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.\nExecutive Summary \nIn 2024, AES delivered on its strategic and financial objectives. We completed construction or the acquisition of 3.0 GW of renewables and energy storage, construction of a 670 MW combined cycle gas plant, and signed long-term PPAs for an additional 4.4 GW of new renewable energy. See \nOverview of our Strategy\n included in Item 1.—\nBusiness\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nCompared with last year, net income increased $984 million, from a net loss of $182 million in 2023 to net income of $802 million in 2024. This increase is the result of lower impairments, unrealized foreign currency gains in the current year versus losses in the prior year, gain on sale of AES Brasil, favorable contributions at the Utilities and New Energy Technologies SBUs, and higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year; partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income, and the prior year gain on sell-down of Fluence.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased $189 million, from $2,828 million to $2,639 million, mainly driven by record-breaking drought conditions and outages in Colombia at the Renewables SBU, lower margins at the Energy Infrastructure SBU due to prior year margin at the hedged merchant Southland facilities that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year and higher outages; partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU and higher revenues from new projects at the Renewables SBU.\nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, a non-GAAP measure, increased $513 million, from $3,439 million to $3,952 million, primarily due to higher realized tax attributes driven by more renewables projects placed in service, partially offset by the drivers above.\nCompared with last year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $2.03, from $0.34 to $2.37. This increase is mainly driven by lower long-lived asset impairments in the current year, higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, prior year unrealized foreign currency losses at the Energy Infrastructure SBU, the gain on sale of AES Brasil, and lower income tax expense. This was partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income, and lower margins due to outages.\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.38 from $1.76 to $2.14, mainly driven by higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, a lower adjusted tax rate, and higher contributions from the Utilities SBU; partially offset by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU.\n82 | 2024 Annual Report\nReview of Consolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nRenewables SBU\n$\n2,510 \n$\n2,339 \n$\n171 \n7 \n%\nUtilities SBU\n3,608 \n3,495 \n113 \n3 \n%\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\n6,238 \n6,836 \n(598)\n-9 \n%\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\n1 \n76 \n(75)\n-99 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n162 \n138 \n24 \n17 \n%\nEliminations\n(241)\n(216)\n(25)\n12 \n%\nTotal Revenue\n12,278 \n12,668 \n(390)\n-3 \n%\nOperating Margin:\nRenewables SBU\n359 \n492 \n(133)\n-27 \n%\nUtilities SBU\n543 \n433 \n110 \n25 \n%\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\n1,273 \n1,418 \n(145)\n-10 \n%\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\n(7)\n(9)\n2 \n-22 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n267 \n239 \n28 \n12 \n%\nEliminations\n(121)\n(69)\n(52)\n75 \n%\nTotal Operating Margin\n2,314 \n2,504 \n(190)\n-8 \n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(288)\n(255)\n(33)\n13 \n%\nInterest expense\n(1,485)\n(1,319)\n(166)\n13 \n%\nInterest income\n381 \n551 \n(170)\n-31 \n%\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(17)\n(63)\n46 \n-73 \n%\nOther expense\n(175)\n(99)\n(76)\n77 \n%\nOther income\n156 \n89 \n67 \n75 \n%\nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n351 \n134 \n217 \nNM\nGoodwill impairment expense\n— \n(12)\n12 \n-100 \n%\nAsset impairment expense\n(374)\n(1,067)\n693 \n-65 \n%\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses)\n31 \n(359)\n390 \nNM\nIncome tax expense\n(59)\n(261)\n202 \n-77 \n%\nNet equity in losses of affiliates\n(26)\n(32)\n6 \n-19 \n%\nINCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n809 \n(189)\n998 \nNM\nGain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses, net of income tax benefit (expense) of $7, $7, and $0, respectively\n(7)\n7 \n(14)\nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS)\n802 \n(182)\n984 \nNM\nLess: Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries\n877 \n431 \n446 \nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION\n$\n1,679 \n$\n249 \n$\n1,430 \nNM\nAMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS:\n— \n%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\n$\n1,686 \n$\n242 \n$\n1,444 \nNM\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(7)\n7 \n(14)\nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION\n$\n1,679 \n$\n249 \n$\n1,430 \nNM\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,752 \n$\n3,034 \n$\n(282)\n-9 \n%\nComponents of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin — \nRevenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the production and sale of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, bad debt expense and recoveries, and general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel.\nOperating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales.\n83 | 2024 Annual Report\nConsolidated Revenue and Operating Margin\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nRevenue\n(in millions)\n    \nConsolidated Revenue\n \n— \nRevenue decreased $390 million, or 3%, in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by: \n•\n$598 million at Energy Infrastructure primarily driven by a $398 million decrease in regulated contract sales and prices, $319 million due to higher revenues from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, $73 million due to lower generation driven by lower dispatch in Argentina, and $69 million impact from the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan; partially offset by $195 million higher realized gains on power swaps; and\n•\n$75 million at New Energy Technologies mainly driven by the sale of the Fallbrook project in March 2023.\nThese unfavorable impacts were partially offset by increases of:\n•\n$171 million at Renewables mainly driven by $205 million due to new projects in service, $61 million of unrealized derivative gains, $58 million of higher contracted energy sales, and $35 million due to the appreciation of the Colombian peso; partially offset by $125 million impact from the sale of our controlling interest in AES Brasil, and $69 million due to higher outages and record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia; and\n•\n$113 million at Utilities mainly driven by a $252 million increase in transmission, distribution, and rider revenues mainly due to higher rates, and $57 million due to higher net retail demand mainly driven by favorable weather; partially offset by $181 million of lower Fuel Adjustment Charge rider revenue.\nOperating Margin\n(in millions)\nConsolidated Operating Margin\n \n— \nOperating margin decreased $190 million, or 8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by:\n84 | 2024 Annual Report\n•\n$145 million at Energy Infrastructure mainly driven by $110 million due to higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, $54 million impact from the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan, $51 million due to higher outages, $39 million due to end of commercial operations at Warrior Run in May 2024, and $31 million due to lower LNG transactions; partially offset by $82 million from a PPA termination loss recognized in the prior year and $45 million of unrealized derivative gains;\n•\n$133 million at Renewables driven by $148 million impact primarily from record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia, alongside drier hydrological conditions in Brazil, $45 million impact of outages at Colombia due to a flooding incident at the Chivor plant which occurred in June 2024, $44 million impact from the sale of our controlling interest in AES Brasil, and $29 million higher fixed costs primarily due to an accelerated growth plan; partially offset by unrealized derivative gains of $61 million and higher contracted energy sales of $58 million; and\n•\n$24 million at Corporate and Other primarily driven by higher eliminations of insurance recoveries booked at the businesses related to AES' self-insurance company.\nThese unfavorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of $110 million at Utilities primarily driven by $83 million due to higher transmission and rider revenues, $76 million due to higher retail rates as a result of the 2024 Base Rate Order, and $72 million due to higher demand primarily from the impact of weather; partially offset by $57 million higher depreciation from additional assets placed in service, the prior year $29 million deferral of power purchase costs associated with the approval of ESP 4, and $25 million higher expected credit losses due to the one-time implementation of customer billing system upgrades.\nSee Item 7.\n—\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—SBU Performance Analysis\n \nof this Form 10-K for additional discussion and analysis of operating results for each SBU.\nConsolidated Results of Operations — Other\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n \nGeneral and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, as well as global development costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $33 million, or 13%, to $288 million in 2024 compared to $255 million in 2023, primarily due to increased business development costs, higher people costs, higher professional fees, and higher IT costs.\nInterest expense \nInterest expense increased $166 million, or 13%, to $1,485 million in 2024, compared to $1,319 million in 2023. This increase was driven by higher interest expense of $67 million and $52 million at the Renewables and Utilities SBUs, respectively, primarily due to new debt issued, net of increased capitalized interest, and higher interest at Corporate of $63 million primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate and debt balance at the Parent Company; partially offset by a $16 million decrease at the Energy Infrastructure SBU primarily due to lower debt balances.\nInterest income \nInterest income decreased $170 million, or 31%, to $381 million in 2024, compared to $551 million in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in Argentina of $138 million primarily due to lower short-term investments at lower rates and a decrease in Brazil of $51 million due to lower short-term investments and the sale of AES Brasil in October 2024; partially offset by an increase in Chile of $30 million mainly driven by interest recognized on the Stabilization Fund receivables.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt decreased $46 million to $17 million in 2024, compared to $63 million in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to prior year losses of $47 million and $10 million due to prepayments at AES Andes and AES Hispanola Holdings BV, respectively, partially offset by a current year loss of $10 million due to a prepayment at AES Andes.\n85 | 2024 Annual Report\nSee Note 12—\nO\nbligations\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther income\nOther income increased $67 million, or 75%, to $156 million in 2024, compared to $89 million in 2023 primarily due to the bargain purchase gain recognized on the Madison and Birdseye acquisition for $20 million, a $17 million increase in gains on remeasurement of contingent consideration primarily on projects acquired at AES Clean Energy, a $14 million gain corresponding to the step acquisition of Felix, and an indexation adjustment of Stabilization Fund receivables at AES Andes of $12 million.\nOther expense\nOther expense increased $76 million, or 77%, to $175 million in 2024, compared to $99 million in 2023 primarily driven by $52 million higher losses on commencement of sales-type leases at AES Renewable Holdings, a $43 million increase in losses on remeasurement of contingent consideration primarily on projects acquired at AES Clean Energy, and a $20 million loss related to legal expenses and other direct costs associated with the troubled debt restructuring at Puerto Rico. This was partially offset by a $36 million decrease in loss on sale and disposal of assets, mainly driven by prior year impairments of inventory due to the planned early plant closures at Ventanas 2, Norgener, and Warrior Run.\nSee Note 22—\nOther Income and Expense\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests \nGain on disposal and sale of business increased $217 million to $351 million in 2024, compared to $134 million in 2023. This increase was driven by the gain on sale of AES Brasil of $312 million and a $52 million gain corresponding to the dilution of AES' ownership in Uplight as a result of the AutoGrid acquisition; partially offset by a $136 million gain on sale of shares of Fluence, our equity method investment, in 2023, and the $10 million loss on the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan, which is now accounted for as an equity method investment.\nSee Note 9—\nInvestments in and Advances to Affiliates\n and Note 25—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n \nincluded in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGoodwill impairment expense \nGoodwill impairment expense was $12 million in 2023 due to impairment at the TEG TEP reporting unit primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate due to increasing risk of non-renewal of operating permits required after March 31, 2024.\nSee Note 10—\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nAsset impairment expense \nAsset impairment expense decreased $693 million, or 65%, to $374 million in 2024, compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to higher prior year impairments, including a $198 million impairment associated with PJM's approval to retire the Warrior Run coal-fired facility; a $186 million impairment at New York Wind related to a repowering project that will result in decommissioning the existing turbines and reducing their depreciable lives; a $137 million impairment associated with the commitment to accelerate the retirement of the Norgener coal-fired facility in Chile; a $77 million and $59 million impairment at TEG and TEP, respectively, due to a reduction in expected capacity cash flows after expiration of the current PPA; and a $59 million impairment at Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan due to the delay in closing the sale transaction. In addition, the decrease was driven by lower impairment expense of $105 million associated with the held-for-sale classification of Mong Duong and lower impairment expense of $56 million at AES Clean Energy Development related to the write-off of project development intangibles for projects that were determined to be no longer viable. This was partially offset by current year impairments of $125 million and $80 million at Ventanas and AES Brasil, respectively, after meeting held-for-sale criteria.\nSee Note 23—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\n86 | 2024 Annual Report\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) \nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) in millions were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCorporate\n$\n33 \n$\n(19)\nChile\n(5)\n(40)\nArgentina\n \n(1)\n2\n(312)\nOther\n1 \n12 \nTotal\n \n(2)\n$\n31 \n$\n(359)\n_____________________________\n(1)\n    Includes peso-denominated energy receivable indexed to the USD through the FONINVEMEM agreement which is considered a foreign currency derivative. See Note 7—\nFinancing Receivables\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\n(2)\n    Includes gains of $137 million and losses of $28 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains of $31 million in 2024, primarily driven by realized gains on swaps and options denominated in the Brazilian real.\nThe Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $359 million in 2023, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Argentine peso, unrealized losses related to an intercompany loan denominated in the Colombian peso, and realized and unrealized foreign currency derivative losses in South America due to the depreciating Colombian peso.\nIncome tax expense \nIncome tax expense was $59 million in 2024 compared to $261 million in 2023. The Company's effective tax rates were 7% and 251% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe 2024 effective tax rate was impacted by the current year benefits associated with ITCs and the restructuring of a foreign holding company. These drivers were partially offset by the impacts of allocations of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects.\nThe 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by the allocation of losses to noncontrolling interest in U.S. tax-equity partnerships and pretax impairments at certain Mexican subsidiaries and at the Mong Duong coal-fired plant in Vietnam. These impacts were partially offset by inflationary and foreign currency impacts at certain Argentine businesses, net of valuation allowances, as well as the recognition of U.S. investment tax credits for renewables projects placed in service in 2023. See Note 23—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for details of the asset impairments. \nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate. Foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the U.S. corporate rate of 21% and are also subject to current U.S. taxation under the GILTI rule. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. See Note 24—\nIncome Taxes\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these reduced rates.\nNet equity in losses of affiliates\nNet equity in losses of affiliates decreased $6 million, or 19%, to $26 million in 2024, compared to $32 million in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a $30 million decrease in losses from Fluence, mainly attributable to improved margins on a new product line. This was partially offset by a $13 million decrease in earnings from Mesa La Paz, primarily due to the prior year termination of derivative positions due to a contract amendment; lower earnings from sPower of $7 million, mainly due to lower earnings from renewables projects that came online; and lower earnings from Energía Natural Dominicana Enadom of $7 million due to lower capitalized interest and higher depreciation.\nSee Note 9—\nInvestments In and Advances to Affiliates\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\n87 | 2024 Annual Report\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries increased $446 million to $877 million in 2024, compared to $431 million in 2023. This increase was primarily due to:\n•\nHigher allocation of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects placed in service of $496 million; and\n•\nHigher losses at Brazil of $60 million, primarily due to held-for-sale impairment.\nThese drivers were partially offset by:\n•\nHigher held-for-sale impairment at Mong Duong in the prior year than the current year of $48 million; and\n•\nSelldowns of business interests resulting in larger shares of income attributable to minority shareholders at the Energy Infrastructure SBU of $46 million.\nNet income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation\nNet income attributable to The AES Corporation increased $1,430 million to $1,679 million in 2024, compared to $249 million in 2023. This increase was primarily due to:\n•\nLower long-lived asset impairments in the current year of $589 million;\n•\nHigher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year of $496 million;\n•\nUnrealized foreign currency losses in the prior year exceeding current year gains by $345 million, primarily driven by higher losses in the prior year at the Energy Infrastructure SBU;\n•\nGain on sale of AES Brasil in the current year of $312 million;\n•\nLower income tax expense attributable to AES, primarily driven by $273 million of tax benefit resulting from the transfer of ITCs directly to third parties; and\n•\nHigher margin from the Utilities SBU impacting net income attributable to AES by $77 million, mainly driven by higher transmission and rider revenues and higher retail rates.\nThese drivers were partially offset by:\n•\nHigher interest expense and lower interest income in the current year of $245 million;\n•\nLower margin from the Energy Infrastructure SBU impacting net income attributable to AES by $147 million, mainly driven by selldowns, higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, and higher outages;\n•\nLower margin at the Renewables SBU impacting net income attributable to AES by $145 million, mainly driven by record-breaking drought conditions and partial outage due to a flooding incident in Colombia; and\n•\nGain on sale of shares in Fluence in the prior year of $136 million.\nSBU Performance Analysis\nSegments\nWe are organized into \nfour\n technology-based SBUs: \nRenewables\n (solar, wind, energy storage, and hydro generation facilities); \nUtilities\n (AES Indiana, AES Ohio, and AES El Salvador regulated utilities and their generation facilities); \nEnergy Infrastructure\n (natural gas, LNG, coal, pet coke, diesel, and oil generation facilities, and our businesses in Chile); and \nNew Energy Technologies\n (investments in Fluence, Uplight, Maximo, and other new and innovative energy technology businesses). Our businesses in Chile, which have a mix of generation sources, including renewables, are included within the Energy Infrastructure SBU, as the generation from all sources is pooled to service our existing PPAs.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements such as investors, industry analysts, and lenders.\n88 | 2024 Annual Report\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company updated the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to include accretion of AROs in the \ndepreciation and amortization\n add-back. We believe excluding accretion of AROs from these metrics better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is aligned with the metrics of our industry peers. For comparability and consistency, all prior period EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures have been recast to conform to the current presentation. The impact of this update resulted in an increase to Adjusted EBITDA of $22 million and $16 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company updated the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS add-back (a) \nunrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities\n to include financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option, and updated add-back (e) \ngains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt\n to include troubled debt restructuring. We believe excluding these gains or losses better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. The Company also removed the adjustment for net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. As this adjustment was specific to certain contract terminations that occurred in 2020, we believe removing this adjustment from our non-GAAP definitions provides simplification and clarity for our investors. There were no such impacts in 2023 or 2024.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company changed the definition of Adjusted EPS to remove the adjustment for \ntax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's U.S. tax return exam\n. As this adjustment was specific to the impacts of tax law reform enacted in 2017, we believe removing this adjustment from our non-GAAP definition provides simplification and clarity for our investors. There were no such impacts in 2022 or 2023.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes \nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs of our equity affiliates, adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements, and excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits, and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring.\nIn addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA includes the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as \ngeneral and administrative expenses\n in Corporate and Other as well as business development costs, \nother expense\n and \nother income,\n \nrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses,\n and \nnet equity in earnings of affiliates\n.\nWe further define Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes as Adjusted EBITDA, adding back the pre-tax effect of Production Tax Credits (“PTCs”), Investment Tax Credits (“ITCs”), and depreciation tax deductions allocated to tax equity investors, as well as the tax benefit recorded from tax credits retained or transferred to third parties.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is \nNet income\n. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant measure considered in the Company’s internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, or financial assets and liabilities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the variability of allocations of earnings to tax equity investors, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, each of these metrics represent the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of businesses and overall complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted \n89 | 2024 Annual Report\nEBITDA is a more transparent measure than \nNet income\n that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company’s results.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes should not be construed as alternatives to \nNet income\n, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet income (loss)\n$\n802 \n$\n(182)\nIncome tax expense\n59 \n261 \nInterest expense\n1,485 \n1,319 \nInterest income\n(381)\n(551)\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs\n1,264 \n1,147 \nEBITDA\n$\n3,229 \n$\n1,994 \nLess: (Income) loss from discontinued operations\n7 \n(7)\nLess: Adjustment for noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries \n(1)\n(734)\n(556)\nLess: Income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income) and depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs from equity affiliates\n136 \n131 \nInterest income recognized under service concession arrangements\n65 \n71 \nUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)\n(94)\n34 \nUnrealized foreign currency losses\n16 \n301 \nDisposition/acquisition gains\n(323)\n(79)\nImpairment losses\n280 \n877 \nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n57 \n62 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n \n(1)\n$\n2,639 \n$\n2,828 \nTax attributes\n1,313 \n611 \nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes \n(2)\n$\n3,952 \n$\n3,439 \n_____________________________\n(1)\nThe allocation of earnings and losses to tax equity investors from both consolidated entities and equity affiliates is removed from Adjusted EBITDA. NCI also excludes amounts allocated to preferred shareholders during the construction phase before a project becomes operational, as this is akin to a financing arrangement.\n(2)         \nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes includes the impact of the share of the ITCs, PTCs, and depreciation deductions allocated to tax equity investors under the HLBV accounting method and recognized as \nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries \non the Consolidated Statements of Operations. It also includes the tax benefit recorded from tax credits retained or transferred to third parties. The tax attributes are related to the Renewables and Utilities SBUs.\n90 | 2024 Annual Report\nAdjusted PTC \nWe define Adjusted PTC as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits, and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.\nAdjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as \ngeneral and administrative expenses\n in the Corporate segment, as well as business development costs, \ninterest expense\n and \ninterest income,\n \nother expense\n and \nother income,\n \nrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses,\n and \nnet equity in earnings of affiliates\n.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is \nincome from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation\n. We believe that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, or financial assets and liabilities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, Adjusted PTC represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results. \nAdjusted PTC should not be construed as an alternative to \nincome from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation\n, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of Adjusted PTC (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nIncome from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to The AES Corporation\n$\n1,686\n \n$\n242\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit) attributable to The AES Corporation\n(19)\n206 \nPre-tax contribution\n1,667 \n448 \nUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)\n(94)\n41 \nUnrealized foreign currency losses\n16 \n301 \nDisposition/acquisition gains\n(320)\n(79)\nImpairment losses\n280 \n877 \nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n65 \n70 \nTotal Adjusted PTC\n$\n1,614 \n$\n1,658 \n91 | 2024 Annual Report\nAdjusted EPS \nWe define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.

This increase was partially offset by $21 million higher general and administrative expenses mainly related to higher development costs.\nKey Trends and Uncertainties \nDuring 2025 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.—\nBusiness\n and Item 1A.—\nRisk Factors\n of this Form 10-K. \nOperational\nTrade Restrictions and Supply Chain \n— In recent years, the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) has initiated investigations into whether imports into the U.S. of solar cells and panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam (“Southeast Asia”) are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty (“AD/CVD”) orders on solar cells and panels from China. One such investigation initiated in April of 2022 resulted in a final determination by Commerce that circumvention would be deemed to occur under certain circumstances, resulting in the imposition AD and CVD duties on the imported cells and panels. Such determination and related matters remain the subject of ongoing litigation. Separate AD/CVD investigations initiated by Commerce in May 2024 resulted in preliminary determinations by Commerce that Southeast Asia countries were also dumping and receiving subsidies and therefore Commerce established CVD and AD rates on solar manufacturers. The U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) is also investigating this matter. If the Commerce and ITC investigations result in Commerce issuing AD/CVD orders, the orders are likely to be imposed in June 2025.\nSeparately, the United States maintains a global tariff (currently 14.25% ad valorem) on solar cells and modules pursuant to the Section 201 Safeguard Action on crystalline silicon photovoltaic products, which became effective in February 2018. On June 21, 2024, President Biden issued Proclamation 10779, revoking the exclusion of bifacial panels from safeguard relief previously proclaimed in Proclamation 10339, and reinstating the tariff on bifacial panels under the Section 201 Safeguard Action, subject to certain qualifications. These global tariffs are expected to expire in February 2026.\nThe United States also maintains a Section 301 tariff on certain Chinese made lithium-ion batteries and related components utilized for energy storage systems, with such tariff currently set at 7.5% and increasing to 25% effective January 1, 2026. There is also an ongoing AD/CVD investigation with respect to exports by China of natural and synthetic graphite used to make lithium-ion battery anode material. Any determinations or orders arising from such investigation could result in price increases.\nAdditionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain areas of China, at any point in the supply chain, and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the U.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers’ ability or \n95 | 2024 Annual Report\nwillingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe Trump Administration has threatened or imposed tariffs on a wide range of countries and sectors. On February 10, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Orders modifying existing Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to expand their scope of applicability and imposing 25% tariffs on both products. At this time, we do not expect the modifications to tariffs on steel and aluminum to have a material impact on our business. On February 13, 2025, the Trump Administration announced a plan to counter non-reciprocal trading arrangements with all U.S. trading partners by determining the equivalent of a reciprocal tariff with respect to each foreign trade partner. On February 1, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and imposing a 10% additional tariff on imports from China and on March 4, 2025, this tariff was increased to 20%. We expect that additional tariffs on imports from China will increase overall costs for materials and parts that are imported to build and maintain renewable energy plants for the U.S. industry. However, AES has already shifted its supply chain outside of China for the vast majority of final products used to build and maintain renewable energy plants in the United States and we expect limited impact to 2025 and 2026 projects due to the recently announced tariffs on China. Any additional U.S. tariffs on imports from other countries or higher tariffs could negatively impact our business.\nThe impact of new tariffs, including reciprocal tariffs, or Commerce investigations, the impact of any additional adverse Commerce determinations or other tariff disputes or litigation, the impact of the UFLPA, potential future disruptions to the renewable energy supply chain and their effect on AES’ U.S. renewable energy project development and construction activities remain uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable energy projects. To that end, we have contracted and imported in the U.S. the solar panels that are necessary to complete our U.S. backlog projects scheduled to finish construction and become operational in 2025 and 2026. Additionally, we have secured and imported in the U.S. the majority of the batteries needed for our energy storage projects scheduled to be completed in 2025 and we have contracted with U.S. or Korean- manufacturers for sufficient volume of batteries for our storage projects scheduled to be completed in 2026. For our U.S. wind projects scheduled to be completed in 2025 and 2026, we have contracted with U.S. and non-Chinese manufacturers to meet our supply needs.\nAdditionally, as part of our supply chain strategy, we are well advanced in securing U.S. domestically manufactured modules to support our U.S. solar growth from 2026 to 2028, with a contractual option to extend deliveries to 2030.\nOperational Sensitivity to Dry Hydrological Conditions\n — Our hydroelectric generation facilities are sensitive to changes in the weather, particularly the level of water inflows into generation facilities. Dry hydrological conditions in Panama, Colombia, and Chile can present challenges for our businesses in these markets. Low inflows can result in low reservoir levels, reduced generation output, and subsequently possible increased prices for electricity. If our hydroelectric generation facilities cannot generate sufficient energy to meet contractual arrangements, we may need to purchase energy to fulfill our obligations, which could have an adverse impact on AES. As mitigation, AES has invested in thermal, wind, and solar generation assets, which have a complementary profile to hydroelectric plants. These plants are expected to have increased generation in low hydrology scenarios, offsetting possible impacts described from hydro assets.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\"), La Niña Conditions are currently observed. La Niña conditions are expected to persist through February-April 2025, with a transition to ENSO-neutral conditions expected during March-May 2025.\nIn Panama, La Niña phenomenon typically results in more precipitation than historical average conditions, however local system impacts may vary due to other factors. Higher hydrology may result in energy surpluses after covering the contracted hydro positions, available to be sold in the spot market.\nIn Colombia, La Niña is typically characterized by more rainfall, possibly leading to a decrease in spot prices. However, during La Niña, impacts vary and the basin where Chivor is located may experience more volatility in rainfall than the rest of the system. Inflows at our Chivor hydroelectric plant were below historical averages in the fourth quarter of 2024. Should dry conditions persist, Chivor may be exposed to higher spot prices.\nIn Chile, the primary driver for AES’ hydro assets is snowpack volumes. If La Niña persists beyond April, it could divert the frontal weather systems to the south of Chile, reducing rainfall in the central area, and possibly reducing the snowpack formation. Lower snowpack, together with reduced rainfall in the system, could increase both spot prices and energy purchase volumes required to meet contracted positions.\n96 | 2024 Annual Report\nThe exact behavior pattern and strength of La Niña is unknown and therefore the impacts could vary from those described above, and may include impacts to our businesses beyond hydrology, including with respect to power generation from other renewable sources of energy and demand. Even if rainfall and water inflows return to historical averages, in some cases market prices and generation above or below the average could persist until reservoir levels are fully recovered. Further, investments made in thermal, wind, and solar power generation may benefit from uncontracted spot sales at higher market prices. Impacts may be material to our results of operations.\nMacroeconomic and Political\nThe macroeconomic and political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed during 2024. This could result in significant impacts to tax laws and environmental and energy policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. See Item 7A.—\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n for further information. \nInflation Reduction Act and U.S. Renewable Energy Tax Credits\n \n— The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law in the United States. The IRA includes provisions that are expected to benefit the U.S. clean energy industry, including increases, extensions, direct transfers and/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage and hydrogen projects. The extension of the solar investment tax credits (\"ITCs\") and production tax credits (“PTCs”), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements has increased demand for our renewables products. \nOur U.S. renewables business has a backlog of approximately 8.4 GW and 51 GW pipeline that we intend to utilize to continue to grow our business, and these changes in tax policy are supportive of this strategy. We account for U.S. renewables projects according to U.S. GAAP, which, when partnering with tax-equity investors to monetize tax benefits, utilizes the HLBV method. This method recognizes the tax-credit value that is transferred to tax equity investors at the time of its creation, which for projects utilizing the investment tax credit begins in the quarter the project is placed in service. For projects utilizing the production tax credit, this value is recognized over 10 years as the facility produces energy. \nThe IRA also allows us to directly transfer investment tax credits to unrelated tax credit buyers. We account for the transfer proceeds as tax benefit throughout the year the renewables project is placed in service.\nIn 2024, we realized $1,313 million of earnings from Tax Attributes, comprised of $1,293 million from the Renewables SBU and $20 million from the Utilities SBU. In 2025, we expect an increase in Tax Attributes earned throughout the year by our U.S. renewables business in line with the growth in that business.\nThe implementation of the IRA requires substantial guidance and interpretive rules from the U.S. Department of Treasury and other government agencies. Some of the guidance and rulemaking enacted under the Biden Administration could be changed or modified by the Trump Administration, creating uncertainty with respect to implementation of the IRA. Also, the Trump Administration has issued Executive Orders that pause certain funding allocated to projects under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the IRA during a 90-day review process. As they currently stand, these Executive Orders do not impact the tax credits under the IRA.\nIt remains uncertain whether Congress will modify or repeal the IRA in connection with the budget reconciliation process or otherwise. While we have taken significant measures to protect against the impact of changes to the IRA, including by implementing a program to ensure our backlog of U.S. renewables projects satisfy IRS safe harbor requirements for qualifying for the ITCs and PTCs, the impacts from any modifications or repeal of the IRA may be material to our results of operations.\nGlobal Tax \n— The macroeconomic and political environments in the U.S. and in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed in recent years. This could result in significant impacts to future tax law. In the U.S., the IRA includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) based on adjusted financial statement income. In September 2024, the IRS released proposed regulations on the 15% CAMT. The impact to the Company during 2024 is not material.\nThe Netherlands, Bulgaria, and Vietnam adopted legislation to implement Pillar 2 effective as of January 1, 2024.\n \nWe will continue to monitor the issuance of draft legislation in other non-EU countries where the Company operates that are considering Pillar 2 amendments and new interpretive guidance. The impact to the Company during 2024 is not material.\n97 | 2024 Annual Report\nInflation \n— In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation recently. While most of our contracts in our international businesses are indexed to inflation, in general, our U.S.-based generation contracts are not indexed to inflation. If inflation continues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase the costs of some of our development projects that could negatively impact their competitiveness. Our utility businesses allow for recovering of operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process, which may have timing impacts on recovery.\nInterest Rates \n— In the U.S. and other markets in which we operate, there has been a rise in interest rates during 2021 through 2023, and interest rates are expected to remain volatile in the near term. As discussed in Item 7A.—\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n, \nalthough most of our existing corporate and subsidiary debt is at fixed rates, an increase in interest rates can have several impacts on our business. For any existing debt under floating rate structures and any future debt refinancings, rising interest rates will increase future financing costs. In most cases in which we have floating rate debt, our revenues serving this debt are indexed to inflation which helps mitigate the impact of rising rates. For future debt refinancings, AES actively manages a hedging program to reduce uncertainty and exposure to future interest rates. For new business, higher interest rates increase the financing costs for new projects under development and which have not yet secured financing.\nAES typically seeks to incorporate expected financing costs into our new PPA pricing such that we maintain our target investment returns, but higher financing costs may negatively impact our returns or the competitiveness of some of our development projects. Additionally, we typically seek to enter into interest rate hedges shortly after signing PPAs to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates prior to securing long-term financing.\nArgentina\n \n— On July 8, 2024, the Argentine government enacted Law 27,742 or Ley Bases, translated in English as Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of the Argentine People. Ley Bases declares a public emergency in administrative, economic, financial, and energy matters for a term of one year, grants delegated powers to the President, and contains a broad reform of the State in order to deregulate the economy, including measures such as labor reform, the implementation of the Incentive Regime for Large Investments, and the modification of several non-income tax measures. The law also opens avenues for privatization of state-owned energy companies. \nIn addition, the Ministry of Energy published Resolution 150/2024 on July 10, 2024 that repeals certain regulations from previous years that imply excessive involvement of the National State and CAMMESA in the operation and functioning of the wholesale electricity market.\nOn January 28th, 2025, the Energy Secretariat of the Ministry of Economy of the Nation issued Resolution 21/2025, initiating a series of reforms in the Wholesale Electricity Market (MEM) aimed at ensuring a more efficient, competitive, and sustainable electrical system. The transition will be gradual, ensuring that the energy supply remains secure and costs for consumers do not increase. The key elements of this reform process include (a) decentralization of fuel management, allowing thermal generators to manage their own fuel supplies; (b) promotion of free bilateral contracts in the market between generators, large users, and distributors, replacing the current contract regulations; (c) the national government's commitment to honor existing generation and fuel contracts until their completion. If necessary, competitive tenders will be conducted for new infrastructure. These changes aim to gradually normalize the operation of the MEM, eliminate unnecessary restrictions, and create economic incentives that encourage the addition of new generation capacity under competitive conditions.\nThese changes may have a profound impact on the sector, influencing our operations and financial results. It is not yet possible to predict the impact of these regulations on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nPuerto Rico\n \n— Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long-term PPAs with state-owned PREPA, which has been facing economic challenges that could result in a material adverse effect on our business in Puerto Rico. Despite the Title III protection, PREPA has been making substantially all of its payments to the generators in line with historical payment patterns.\nThe Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) was enacted to create a structure for exercising federal oversight over the fiscal affairs of U.S. territories and created procedures for \n98 | 2024 Annual Report\nadjusting debt accumulated by the Puerto Rico government and, potentially, other territories (“Title III”). PROMESA also expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical projects in Puerto Rico. \nPROMESA allowed for the establishment of an Oversight Board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over Puerto Rico. The Oversight Board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of PREPA under Title III in July 2017. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, AES Ilumina’s non-recourse debt of $22 million continues to be in technical default and is classified as current as of December 31, 2024. The non-recourse debt at AES Puerto Rico is also in payment default.\nIn 2022, mediation commenced to resolve the PREPA Title III case. PREPA's plan confirmation mediation was extended to March 24, 2025, and the decision is still pending.\nConsidering the information available as of the date hereof, management believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets at AES Puerto Rico of $80 million is recoverable as of December 31, 2024.\nDecarbonization Initiatives\nOur strategy involves shifting towards clean energy platforms, including renewable energy, energy storage, LNG, and modernized grids. It is designed to position us for continued growth while reducing our carbon intensity and in support of our mission of accelerating the future of energy, together. We have made significant progress on our exit of coal generation, and by year-end 2025 we intend to have exited the substantial majority of our coal facilities that we owned in 2022. Due to a number of factors, including grid and market dynamics, we will continue to work towards exiting coal in the limited markets where we maintain coal generation. We currently anticipate these efforts will continue beyond 2027. We expect to further reduce the carbon intensity of our operations as we add more long-term contracted renewables to the grid each year.\nIn addition, initiatives have been announced by regulators, including in Chile, Puerto Rico, and Bulgaria, and offtakers in recent years, with the intention of reducing GHG emissions generated by the energy industry. In parallel, the shift towards renewables has caused certain customers to migrate to other low-carbon energy solutions and this trend may continue.\nAlthough we cannot currently estimate the financial impact of these decarbonization initiatives, new legislative or regulatory programs further restricting carbon emissions or other initiatives to voluntarily exit coal generation could require material capital expenditures, resulting in a reduction of the estimated useful life of certain coal facilities, or have other material adverse effects on our financial results.\nFor further information about the risks associated with decarbonization initiatives, see Item 1A.\n—\nRisk Factors\n—\nConcerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses\n included in this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory\nFERC, RTOs and Interconnection Prioritization \n— On February 11, 2025, FERC approved PJM's request for a one-time change in its interconnection process to expedite the interconnection of a limited number of high-capacity resources to support near-term resource adequacy and grid reliability. This change to PJM's interconnection process is not expected to impact the PJM projects already in our backlog since they have received interconnection approvals. However, it will likely create uncertainty and delays in the time for interconnection approvals for our development pipeline of renewables projects in PJM. Other RTOs are considering similar proposals to expedite interconnection approvals for certain high-capacity resources. See Item 1A.—\nRisk Fa\nctors\n - Our development projects are subject to substantial uncertainties\n of this Form 10-K for further details.\nU.S. Executive Orders\n — A recent Executive Order has required a review of all federal onshore wind leasing and federal permitting \npractices. In executing this order, the Department of Interior and other agencies have paused federal permitting for all wind projects on federal lands and private lands with a federal nexus, and have also paused federal permitting for solar, storage, and other renewables for 60-days. Our U.S. renewables projects are developed primarily on private land and are designed in a manner that minimizes the potential of a federal nexus. At this time, we do not expect this Order to have a significant impact on our business.\nAES Maritza PPA Review\n \n— DG Comp is conducting a preliminary review of whether AES Maritza’s PPA with NEK is compliant with the European Union's State Aid rules. No formal investigation has been launched by DG Comp to date. AES Maritza has previously engaged in discussions with the DG Comp case team and the \n99 | 2024 Annual Report\nGovernment of Bulgaria to attempt to reach a negotiated resolution of the DG Comp’s review (\"PPA Discussions\"). There are no active PPA Discussions at present but those discussions could resume at any time. The PPA continues to remain in place. However, there can be no assurance that, in the context of DG Comp's preliminary review or any future PPA Discussions, the other parties will not seek a prompt termination of the PPA.\nWe do not believe termination of the PPA is justified. Nevertheless, the PPA Discussions involved a range of potential outcomes, including but not limited to the termination of the PPA and payment of some level of compensation to AES Maritza. Any negotiated resolution would be subject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and DG Comp approval. At this time, we cannot predict whether and when the PPA Discussions might resume or the outcome of any such discussions. Nor can we predict how DG Comp might resolve its review if the PPA Discussions do not resume or if any such discussions fail to result in an agreement concerning the agency's review. AES Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement or otherwise. However, there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our long-lived assets at Maritza is $309 million.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nWe operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. \nThe overall economic climate in Argentina has deteriorated, resulting in volatility and increased the risk that a further significant devaluation of the Argentine peso against the USD, similar to the devaluations experienced by the country in 2018, 2019, and 2023, may occur. A continued trend of peso devaluation could result in increased inflation, a deterioration of the country’s risk profile, and other adverse macroeconomic effects that could significantly impact our results of operations. For additional information, refer to Item 7A.—\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n.\nImpairments and Realizability\nLong-lived Assets and Current Assets Held-for-Sale\n —\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $374 million. See Note 23—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \nof this Form 10-K for further information. After recognizing these impairment expenses, the carrying value of our investments in long-lived assets and current assets held-for-sale that were assessed for impairment following a triggering event in 2024 totaled $124 million at December 31, 2024. \nEvents or changes in circumstances that may necessitate recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not the asset will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life.\nTax Asset Realizability — \nCertain AES Chilean businesses have recorded net deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") of $232 million relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, which are not subject to expiration. Their realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income. At this time, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the DTA will be realized; however, it could be reduced by way of valuation allowance in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. \nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion, of which $265 million was held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies. The Company had $79 million in short-term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries, and restricted cash and debt service reserves of $515 million. The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $22.7 billion \n100 | 2024 Annual Report\nand $5.7 billion, respectively. Of the $2.7 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $2.5 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and $186 million relates to debt considered in default. AES Puerto Rico is in payment default. All other defaults are not payment defaults but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents. Additionally, on February 6, 2025, AES Dominican Renewable Energy failed to comply with a covenant on its debt of $354 million, resulting in a technical default. AES Dominican Renewable Energy is classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024, therefore the associated non-recourse debt is classified in \nCurrent held-for-sale liabilities\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 12—\nO\nbligations\n and Note 25—\nHeld-For-Sale and Dispositions \nin Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements \nof this Form 10-K for additional detail. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had $917 million outstanding related to supplier financing arrangements\n.\nWe expect current maturities of non-recourse debt, recourse debt, and amounts due under supplier financing arrangements to be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the liability relates, through opportunistic refinancing activity, or some combination thereof. We have $899 million in recourse debt which matures within the next twelve months. Furthermore, we have $616 million due under supplier financing arrangements that have a Parent Company guarantee. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material. \nWe rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies, and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross-default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.\nGiven our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company does not have any material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate debt. Additionally, commercial paper issuances are short term in nature and subject the Parent Company to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing the paper. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's $28.8 billion of total gross debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024, approximately $8.9 billion accrues interest at variable rates. The Company actively hedges its current and expected variable rate exposure through a combination of currently effective and forward starting interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2024, the total maximum outstanding amount of hedges protecting the company against variable rate exposure was $7.9 billion. These hedges generally provide economic protection through the entire expected life of the projects, regardless of the type of debt issued to finance construction or refinance the projects in the future.\nIn addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock, and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support in support of tax equity partnerships or for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment, or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the Parent Company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. As of December 31, 2024, the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $3.0 billion in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).\n101 | 2024 Annual Report\nSome counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $378 million in letters of credit under bilateral agreements, $129 million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our unsecured credit facilities, and $18 million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our revolving credit facilities. These letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development and construction activities and business operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Parent Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 1% to 3% per annum on the outstanding amounts.\nAdditionally, in connection with certain project financings, some of the Company's subsidiaries have expressly undertaken limited obligations and commitments. These contingent contractual obligations are issued at the subsidiary level and are non-recourse to the Parent Company. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum undiscounted potential exposure to guarantees and letters of credit issued by our subsidiaries was $5.3 billion, including $2.2 billion of customary payment guarantees under EPC contracts and other agreements, $1.4 billion of letters of credit outstanding, $1.2 billion of surety bonds and other guarantees issued by insurance companies, and $388 million of tax equity financing related guarantees.\nWe expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.\nMany of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses.\nLong-Term Receivables\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $102 million of gross accounts receivable classified as \nOther noncurrent assets\n. These noncurrent receivables mostly consist of accounts receivable in the U.S. and Chile that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond December 31, 2025, or one year from the latest balance sheet date. Noncurrent receivables in the U.S. pertain to the sale of the Redondo Beach land. Noncurrent receivables in Chile pertain primarily to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Funds created by the Chilean government. See Note 7—\nFinancing Receivables\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $963 million of loans receivable related to the Mong Duong facility in Vietnam, which was constructed under a BOT contract. This loan receivable represents contract consideration related to the construction of the facility, which was substantially completed in 2015, and will be collected over the 25-year term of the plant's PPA. As of December 31, 2024, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan receivable balance, net of CECL reserve of $23 million, was classified in held-for-sale assets. Of the loan receivable balance, $121 million was classified in \nCurrent held-for-sale assets\n, and $842 million was classified in \nNoncurrent held-for-sale assets \non the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 21—\nRevenue\n \nincluded in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \nof this Form 10-K for further information.\n102 | 2024 Annual Report\nCash Sources and Uses\nThe primary sources of cash for the Company in the year ended December 31, 2024 were debt financings, cash flows from operating activities, purchases under supplier financing arrangements, sales to noncontrolling interests, and sales of short-term investments. The primary uses of cash in the year ended December 31, 2024 were repayments of debt, capital expenditures, repayments of obligations under supplier financing arrangements, and purchases of short-term investments.\nThe primary sources of cash for the Company in the year ended December 31, 2023 were debt financings, cash flows from operating activities, sales to noncontrolling interests, purchases under supplier financing arrangements, and sales of short-term investments. The primary uses of cash in the year ended December 31, 2023 were repayments of debt, capital expenditures, repayments of obligations under supplier financing arrangements, purchases of short-term investments, and acquisitions of business interests.\nA summary of cash-based activities is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCash Sources:\n2024\n2023\nIssuance of non-recourse debt\n$\n7,236 \n$\n4,521 \nBorrowings under the revolving credit facilities\n6,806 \n7,103 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n2,752 \n3,034 \nPurchases under supplier financing arrangements\n1,786 \n1,858 \nIssuance of recourse debt\n1,450 \n1,400 \nSales to noncontrolling interests\n1,247 \n1,938 \nSale of short-term investments\n796 \n1,318 \nProceeds from the sale of business interests, net of cash and restricted cash sold\n423 \n254 \nContributions from noncontrolling interests\n222 \n102 \nIssuance of preferred shares in subsidiaries\n— \n421 \nOther\n103 \n5 \nTotal Cash Sources\n$\n22,821 \n$\n21,954 \nCash Uses:\nCapital expenditures \n(1)\n$\n(7,392)\n$\n(7,724)\nRepayments under the revolving credit facilities\n(6,197)\n(6,285)\nRepayments of non-recourse debt\n(4,306)\n(2,495)\nRepayments of obligations under supplier financing arrangements\n(1,794)\n(1,491)\nPurchase of short-term investments\n(818)\n(937)\nDividends paid on AES common stock\n(483)\n(444)\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests\n(430)\n(323)\nAcquisitions of business interests, net of cash and restricted cash acquired\n(246)\n(542)\nPurchase of emissions allowances\n(206)\n(268)\nRepayments of recourse debt\n(200)\n(500)\nPayments for financing fees\n(138)\n(142)\nPayments for financed capital expenditures\n(127)\n(10)\nContributions and loans to equity affiliates\n(103)\n(178)\nAcquisitions of noncontrolling interests\n— \n(127)\nOther \n(2)\n(332)\n(585)\nTotal Cash Uses\n$\n(22,772)\n$\n(22,051)\nNet decrease in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n$\n49 \n$\n(97)\n_____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes interest capitalized on development and construction of $637 million and $563 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total capitalized in 2024 and 2023, $577 million and $486 million, respectively, are related to recourse and non-recourse debt interest payments. The remaining capitalized interest is primarily related to supplier financing arrangements.\n(2)\nIncludes the $63 million and $270 million effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impacts in 2023 are primarily related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso as Argentina's economy was highly inflationary.

partially offset by lower margins at our Renewables and Energy Infrastructure SBUs, higher interest expense, and lower interest income.\n•\nChange in working capital decreased $402 million, primarily due to a $522 million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher billings and the timing of collections and an increase in inventory of $220 million due to higher coal consumption in the prior year; partially offset by a $153 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets due to proceeds from interest rate swap settlements, insurance recoveries, and VAT recoveries as well as the collection of Stabilization Fund receivables in Chile, partially offset by additional lease options and long-term security deposits in the current year at ACED.\n104 | 2024 Annual Report\nInvesting Activities \nFiscal Year 2024 versus 2023\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $488 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.\nInvesting Cash Flows\n(in millions)\n•\nAcquisitions of business interests decreased $296 million, primarily due to the prior year acquisitions of Rexford at AES Renewable Holdings for $228 million, Bellefield at ACED for $165 million, and Bolero Solar Park in Chile for $114 million; partially offset by the current year acquisitions of Atacama Solar in Chile for $105 million and various acquisitions of renewables development projects at ACED in the current year totaling $79 million.\n•\nProceeds from sales of business interests increased $169 million, primarily due to proceeds of $412 million, net of transaction costs and cash sold, from the sale of AES Brasil; partially offset by the prior year selldowns of our ownership interests in Fluence for $156 million and in sPower OpCo B for $98 million.\n•\nCash from short-term investing activities decreased $403 million, primarily driven by a decrease of $363 million in Brazil due to lower cash requirements for capital expenditures and the sale of AES Brasil in October 2024.\n•\nCapital expenditures decreased $332 million, discussed further below.\n105 | 2024 Annual Report\nCapital Expenditures\n(in millions)\n(1)\nGrowth expenditures generally include expenditures related to development projects in construction, expenditures that increase capacity of a facility beyond the original design, and investments in general load growth or system modernization.\n(2)\nMaintenance expenditures generally include expenditures that are necessary to maintain regular operations or net maximum capacity of a facility.\n(3)\nEnvironmental expenditures generally include expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, expenditures for safety programs and other expenditures to ensure a facility continues to operate in an environmentally responsible manner.\n•\nGrowth expenditures decreased $322 million, primarily driven by lower expenditures in Brazil of $406 million primarily due to completion of the Cajuina wind projects in the prior year and the sale of AES Brasil in October 2024, and a $246 million decrease in expenditures for U.S. renewables projects compared to the prior year; partially offset by higher expenditures at our U.S. utilities of $187 million mainly due to higher transmission and distribution project investments, and higher expenditures in Chile of $121 million due to new solar project development.\n•\nMaintenance expenditures decreased $11 million, primarily due to lower expenditures in Brazil of $40 million primarily due to completion of the Cajuina wind projects in the prior year and the sale of AES Brasil in October 2024; partially offset by higher expenditures of $32 million at Southland due to the extension of compliance dates for the OTC units.\n•\nEnvironmental expenditures increased $1 million, with no material drivers.\nFinancing Activities \nFiscal Year 2024 versus 2023\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $442 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.\nFinancing Cash Flows\n(in millions)\nSee Notes 12—\nO\nbligations \nand 18—\nEquity\n \nin Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for more information regarding significant transactions.\n106 | 2024 Annual Report\n•\nThe $691 million impact from sales to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to a $210 million decrease in proceeds received at AES Clean Energy from the sales of ownership in project companies to tax equity investors, the prior year sales of a 20% interest in AES Dominicana for $192 million and a 35% interest in Colon for $140 million, and a $146 million decrease in sales under the Chile Renovables renewables partnerships with GIP.\n•\nThe $534 million impact from non-recourse revolvers is primarily due to higher net repayments at our Energy Infrastructure and Renewables SBUs.\n•\nThe $421 million impact from issuance of preferred shares in subsidiaries is due to $275 million of proceeds received in the prior year from the issuance of preferred shares to GIP as part of the Chile Renovables partnership, and the prior year issuance of $143 million of preferred shares to HASI at AES Renewable Holdings for OpCo 1.\n•\nThe $375 million impact from supplier financing arrangements is primarily due to higher net cash outflows at the Renewables SBU; partially offset by higher net cash inflows at the Energy Infrastructure SBU.\n•\nThe $904 million impact from non-recourse debt transactions is mainly due to higher net borrowings at the Energy Infrastructure and Utilities SBUs of $236 million and $248 million, respectively, and lower net repayments at AES Hispanola Holdings, BV, and the Renewables SBU of $279 million and $142 million, respectively. \n•\nThe $350 million impact from recourse debt is primarily due to the issuance of $1.5 billion of subordinated notes and repayments of $200 million at the Parent Company in the current year; partially offset by the issuance of $900 million of senior notes at the Parent Company in the prior year.\n•\nThe $325 million impact from the Parent Company revolver is primarily due to lower net repayments in the current year.\nParent Company Liquidity\nThe following discussion is included as a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to \nCash and cash equivalents,\n which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Parent Company Liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program; and proceeds from asset sales. The Parent Company credit facilities and commercial paper program are generally used for short-term cash needs to bridge the timing of distributions from subsidiaries. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund interest and principal repayments of debt, construction commitments, other equity commitments, acquisitions, taxes, Parent Company overhead and development costs, and dividends on common stock.\nThe Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies, plus available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and commercial paper program. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, \nCash and cash equivalents\n, at the periods indicated as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nConsolidated cash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,524 \n$\n1,426 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries\n(1,259)\n(1,393)\nParent Company and qualified holding companies' cash and cash equivalents\n265 \n33 \nCommitments under the Parent Company credit facilities\n1,800 \n1,500 \nLess: Letters of credit under the credit facilities\n(18)\n(124)\nBorrowings available under the Parent Company credit facilities\n1,782 \n1,376 \nTotal Parent Company Liquidity\n$\n2,047 \n$\n1,409 \nThe Parent Company paid dividends of $0.69 per outstanding share to its common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2024. While we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have \n107 | 2024 Annual Report\nsufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends.\nRecourse Debt\nOur total recourse debt was $5.7 billion and $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 12—\nO\nbligations\n in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for additional detail.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. This belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions, and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We have met our interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the Parent Company level with our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. See Item 1A.—\nRisk Factors\n—\nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries\n,\n of this Form 10-K.\nVarious debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items, limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level.\nNon-Recourse Debt\nWhile the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:\n•\nreducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of any default;\n•\ntriggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;\n•\ncausing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and\n•\ntriggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company.\nFor example, our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain bankruptcy-related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.\nSome of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to $2.7 billion. The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $186 million at December 31, 2024, all of which was non-recourse debt related to three subsidiaries — AES Puerto Rico, AES Ilumina, and AES Jordan Solar. AES Puerto Rico is in payment default. All other defaults are not payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants or other conditions contained in the non-recourse debt documents. Additionally, on February 6, 2025, AES Dominican Renewable Energy failed to comply with a covenant on its debt of $354 million, resulting in a technical default. AES Dominican Renewable Energy is classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024, therefore the associated non-recourse debt is classified in \nCurrent held-for-sale liabilities\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 12—\nObligations\n and Note 25—\nHeld-For-Sale and Dispositions \nin Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for additional detail.\n108 | 2024 Annual Report\nNone of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under the Parent Company's debt agreements as of December 31, 2024, in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under the Parent Company's indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a \"material subsidiary\" and thereby trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent Company's outstanding debt securities. A material subsidiary is defined in the Parent Company's revolving credit agreement as any business that contributed 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2024, none of the defaults listed above resulted in a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company. Furthermore, none of the non-recourse debt in default listed above is guaranteed by the Parent Company.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Contractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations, commitments and other liabilities as of December 31, 2024 is presented below (in millions):\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\nLess than 1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than 5 years\nOther\nFootnote Reference\n(5)\nDebt obligations\n \n(1) (2)\n$\n28,794 \n$\n3,578 \n$\n8,710 \n$\n3,689 \n$\n12,817 \n$\n— \n12 \nInterest payments on long-term debt\n \n(3)\n14,941 \n1,387 \n2,203 \n1,739 \n9,612 \n— \nN/A\nSupplier financing arrangements\n917 \n917 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n12 \nFinance lease obligations\n (2)\n1,297 \n28 \n57 \n59 \n1,153 \n— \n15 \nOperating lease obligations\n (2)\n1,409 \n48 \n102 \n92 \n1,167 \n— \n15 \nElectricity obligations\n8,922 \n759 \n1,391 \n1,288 \n5,484 \n— \n13 \nFuel obligations\n5,741 \n1,701 \n1,779 \n1,002 \n1,259 \n— \n13 \nOther purchase obligations\n4,113 \n2,485 \n454 \n282 \n892 \n— \n13 \nOther long-term liabilities reflected on AES' consolidated balance sheet under GAAP\n (2) (4)\n1,077 \n— \n592 \n4 \n470 \n11 \nN/A\nTotal\n$\n67,211 \n$\n10,903 \n$\n15,288 \n$\n8,155 \n$\n32,854 \n$\n11 \n_____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes recourse and non-recourse debt presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See Note 25—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n \nin Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \nof this Form 10-K for additional information related to held-for-sale businesses.\n(3)\nInterest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2024 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or new debt issuances. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2024.\n(4)\nThese amounts do not include current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets except for the current portion of uncertain tax obligations. Noncurrent uncertain tax obligations are reflected in the \"Other\" column of the table above as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the future payments. In addition, these amounts do not include: (1) regulatory liabilities (See Note 11—\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n), (2) contingencies (See Note 14—\nContingencies\n), (3) pension and other postretirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 16—\nBenefit Plans\n), (4) derivatives and incentive compensation (See Note 6—\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n) or (5) any taxes (See Note 24—\nIncome Taxes\n) except for uncertain tax obligations, as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments. See the indicated notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded.\n(5)\nFor further information see the note referenced below in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \nof this Form 10-K.\nThe following table presents our Parent Company's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024:\nContingent Contractual Obligations\nMaximum Exposure (in millions)\nNumber of Agreements\nMaximum Exposure Range for Each Agreement (in millions)\nGuarantees and commitments\n$\n3,040 \n89\n< $1 — 350\nLetters of credit under bilateral agreements\n378 \n9\n$11— 88\nLetters of credit under the unsecured credit facilities\n129 \n28\n< $1 — 50\nLetters of credit under the revolving credit facilities\n18 \n9\n< $1 — 4\nSurety bonds\n2 \n2\n< $1 — 1\nTotal\n$\n3,567 \n137\nAdditionally, some of the Company's subsidiaries have contingent contractual obligations that are non-recourse to the Parent Company. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum undiscounted potential exposure to guarantees issued by our subsidiaries was $5.3 billion, including $2.2 billion of customary payment guarantees under EPC \n109 | 2024 Annual Report\ncontracts and other agreements, $1.4 billion of letters of credit outstanding, $1.2 billion of surety bonds and other guarantees issued by insurance companies, and $388 million of tax equity financing related guarantees.\nWe have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support, and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2024, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nManagement believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\n \n— We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\nBecause we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a \n110 | 2024 Annual Report\ndeferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.\nIn addition, the Company has elected an accounting policy not to consider the effects of being subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in future periods when assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards, and tax credits. Any effect on the realization of deferred tax assets will be recognized in the period they arise.\nThe Company accounts for tax credits that it will retain or transfer as a reduction in income tax expense by either including the expected amount of the tax credit to be claimed or the cash to be received when transferred, respectively, in the calculation of its annual effective tax rate. The estimated tax credits are updated on a quarterly basis, with the year-end calculation including only the tax credits that are associated with projects placed in service, comprising credits claimed or transferred during the year. In assessing realizability for credits to be transferred, the Company includes cash it anticipates receiving in establishing any valuation allowance and establishes a valuation allowance equal to its best estimate of any discount on the transfer. The receipt of cash from the transfer of tax credits is treated as an operating cash inflow.\nImpairments\n \n— Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets, including events that lead to possible impairment, are described in detail in Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets, starting with determining if an impairment indicator exists. The Company exercises judgment in determining if these indicators or events represent an impairment indicator requiring the computation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. The fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. Please see \nFair Value\n below for further detail.\nAs part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the surplus of fair value above carrying amount decreases or becomes negative. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.\nFurther discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 10—\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n \nand Note 23—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K.\nDepreciation\n \n— Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. The Company considers many factors in its estimate of useful lives, including expected usage, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-taker agreements, and laws and regulations, among others. In certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and require management to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon. \nUseful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. Depreciation studies are performed periodically for assets subject to composite depreciation. Any change to useful lives is considered a change in accounting estimate and is made on a prospective basis.\nFair Value \n— For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n \n— A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit and mutual funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional \n111 | 2024 Annual Report\ndiscussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 5—\nFair Value\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K.\nFair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities\n \n— Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the relevant accounting guidance requires the Company to recognize the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by VIEs at fair value. \nThe Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The Company generally utilizes the income approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") model to estimate fair value by discounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.\nManagement applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices, changes in interest rates, and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. \nA considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n \n— We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. See Note 6—\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n \nincluded in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification.\nThe fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Credit risk for AES is evaluated at the level of the entity that is party to the contract. Nonperformance risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize market inputs that may or may not be observable.\nAs a result of uncertainty, complexity, and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, and future foreign exchange rates. Refer to Note 5—\nFair Value\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nThe fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, and Platt's). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, published pricing may not extend \n112 | 2024 Annual Report\nthrough the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value.\nRegulatory Assets\n \n— Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.\nConsolidation\n \n— The Company enters into transactions impacting the Company's equity interests in its affiliates. In connection with each transaction, the Company must determine whether the transaction impacts the Company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.\nIf the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the Company must consolidate the entity is whether the Company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by AES.\nAlternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AES shareholders have substantive participating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights), then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. Significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. While both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates.\nPension and Other Postretirement Plans\n \n— The Company recognizes a net asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. The valuation of the Company's benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs requires various estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. These assumptions are reviewed by the Company on an annual basis. Refer to Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nincluded in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nRevenue Recognition\n \n— The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of energy, capacity, and other services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In applying the revenue model, we determine whether the sale of energy, capacity, and other services represent a single performance obligation based on the individual market and terms of the contract. Generally, the promise to transfer energy and capacity represent a performance obligation that is satisfied over time and meets the criteria to be accounted for as a series of distinct goods or services. Progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured using output methods, such as MWhs delivered or MWs made available, and when we are entitled to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly to the value of our performance completed to date, we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. For further information regarding the nature of our revenue streams and our critical accounting policies affecting revenue recognition, see Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nincluded in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K.\n113 | 2024 Annual Report\nLeases\n \n— The Company recognizes operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for most leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months. Lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. Our subsidiaries’ incremental borrowing rates are used in determining the present value of lease payments when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as prepayments, lease incentives, or initial direct costs. For further information regarding the nature of our leases and our critical accounting policies affecting leases, see Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K.\nCredit Losses \n— The Company uses a forward-looking \"expected loss\" model to recognize allowances for credit losses on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the Company continues to measure impairments of available-for-sale securities as was done under previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due to credit-related factors are now recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further information regarding credit losses, see Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n and Note 8—\nAllowance for Credit Losses \nincluded in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n    See Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \nof this Form 10-K for further information about new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2024 and accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective.",
