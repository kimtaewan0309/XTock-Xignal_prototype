  "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS\nCME Group enables clients to trade futures, options, cash and over-the-counter (OTC) products, optimize portfolios, and analyze data - empowering market participants worldwide the ability to efficiently manage risk and capture opportunities. CME Group provides primary price discovery and referential pricing information through its market data in a variety of formats, including real-time, historical and derived data for customers in both listed and cash products. CME Group also offers industry-leading research and analytics tools to provide customers with market education resources. In addition, it operates one of the world's leading central counterparty clearing providers.\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\nCME was founded in 1898 as a not-for-profit corporation. It established its clearing house in 1919, which is operated as part of \n \nCME. CME demutualized in 2000, and in 2002 its parent company, CME Group, completed an initial public offering of its Class A common stock (Nasdaq: CME).\n \nCME Group subsequently acquired CBOT Holdings, Inc. in 2007, NYMEX Holdings, Inc. (NYMEX and COMEX) in 2008, the Kansas City Board of Trade in 2012 and NEX Group plc (NEX) in 2018. The combination with NEX expanded our global customer base and product offerings through the complementary combination of CME Group’s exchange-traded derivative products and NEX’s cash and OTC products. It also created a leading, client-centric, global markets company, generating capital efficiencies across futures, cash and OTC products for market participants seeking to lower their cost of trading and better manage risk. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, our telephone number is 312-930-1000 and our website is \ncmegroup.com\n.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nCME Group exchanges offer the widest range of global benchmark products across interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange (FX), and agricultural, energy and metals commodities. We also offer cash and repo fixed income trading via BrokerTec, and spot and OTC FX trading via EBS. Additionally, we operate one of the world’s leading central counterparty clearing providers. \nDerivatives Exchange Business:\n Through our derivatives exchanges and clearing house, we believe our customers prefer CME Group's diversity of products, liquidity, price transparency and technological capabilities. Market liquidity - or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently - is key to attracting and retaining customers and contributing to a market's success. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculation and asset allocation related to the risks associated with, among other things, interest rate sensitive instruments, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of agricultural, energy and metal commodities.\n•\nCME's\n product slate includes agricultural, equities, FX, OTC Interest Rate Swaps complex, cryptocurrencies/alternative investments and interest rate products, including Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) futures and options, Fed Funds futures and options, livestock and cash-settled contracts based on the S&P 500, Micro E-mini Equity Index contracts, Nasdaq-100, FTSE Russell, Nikkei and Bitcoin and Ether futures and options.\n•\nCBOT's\n product slate consists of agricultural, equities and interest rate products, including contracts for United States (U.S.) Treasury futures, soybean, corn and wheat and contracts based on the Dow Jones Industrial Index.\n•\nNYMEX's\n product slate consists of energy and metals products, including contracts for crude oil, natural gas, heating oil (or low sulfur diesel), gasoline, emissions (GEO, N-GEO and C-GEO), platinum and palladium.\n•\nCOMEX's\n product slate consists of metals products, including contracts for gold, silver, copper and other base, ferrous and battery metals.\nWe believe the breadth and diversity of our products and services lines are beneficial to our customers and CME Group's overall performance. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to manage risks and achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house.\nCME Group products are traded primarily through CME Globex, as well as by open outcry in Chicago for SOFR options and through privately negotiated transactions. \nWe strive to provide the most flexible and scalable platforms to support the operational and capacity needs of our business along with the delivery of innovative technology solutions to the marketplace. Our CME Globex electronic trading system operates our central limit order book markets and is available on a global basis nearly 24 hours a day throughout the trading week. The CME Globex platform is accessible through a wide variety of vendor-provided and custom-built trading systems that benefit from our open application programming interface approach. For electronic and privately negotiated markets, we offer brokers and customers the CME Direct platform for arranging, executing, recording and risk-managing trades across all six major asset classes. We also provide the functionality to connect to CME Direct on a mobile device through our CME Direct Mobile application with full trading and on-the-go order management capabilities.\n \n5\nTable of Contents\nTogether, our platforms offer:\n•\ncertainty and flexibility of execution;  \n•\nextensive capabilities to facilitate complex and demanding trading;  \n•\ndirect market access;  \n•\nopen access, price transparency and anonymity; \n•\nconvenience and efficiency; \n•\nconnectivity through highly secure, resilient and low-latency network options; \n•\naccess to market data; and\n•\nglobal distribution, including connectivity through high-speed international telecommunications hubs in key financial centers.\nWe maintain comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans, as well as facilities designed to provide nearly continuous availability of our markets in the event of a business disruption or disaster. We also maintain incident and crisis management plans that address responses to disruptive events.\nThe customer base of our derivatives exchanges includes professional traders, financial institutions, institutional and individual investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers may be members of one or more of our exchanges. Rights to directly access our derivatives markets will depend upon the nature of the customer, such as whether the entity or individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access.\nU.S. trading rights and privileges are exchange-specific. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members. Membership on one of our derivatives exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at lower fees. Under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges, our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections, certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections. In 2024\n, 85% of \nour contract volume was from trades by our members.\nCME Clearing Business: \nThrough our clearing house operated by CME, we provide clearing and settlement services for a broad range of exchange-traded futures and options on futures contracts and OTC derivatives. Our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and the soundness of our markets by serving as the counterparty to every trade, becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer, and limiting counterparty credit risk. The clearing house marks open positions to market at least twice a trading day, requiring payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and making payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For select cleared-only markets, positions are marked-to-market daily, with the capacity to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. The CME ClearPort front-end system provides access to our flexible clearing services over multiple asset classes. For certain of these exchange-traded derivatives contracts, the clearing house assists in the administration of physical delivery of the underlying product. The clearing house does not guarantee physical delivery. Rather, in the event of a delivery failure, the clearing house has a financial performance obligation to the clearing member whose actions or omissions did not cause or contribute to the delivery failure. The clearing house also monitors the risk and operational capabilities for facilitating the delivery for physically deliverable exchange-traded derivatives contracts as outlined below.\nThe majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One firm represented at least 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2024. In the event a clearing firm were to withdraw, our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to one or more other clearing firms of the exchange.\nCash Markets Business:\n Our cash markets business comprises BrokerTec and EBS, primarily operated on CME Globex. Certain BrokerTec products are cleared through third-party clearing houses. BrokerTec is fully integrated with all major ISVs for order entry and staging as well as post trade for clearing and settlement, offering an efficient and fully electronic end-to-end trade workflow solution. BrokerTec and EBS offer anonymous and disclosed trading venues, offering clients multiple execution and distribution options and the benefit of an established and far-reaching distribution network of liquidity providers and consumers. \nBrokerTec operates global electronic trading for fixed income and money market products, with a leading position in cash U.S. Treasuries, European Government Bonds, and Repo on European Union (E.U.), United Kingdom (U.K.), U.S. and other international G10, emerging market fixed income instruments and Supranational and Agency Bonds. It facilitates trading for banks and non-bank professional trading firms. The BrokerTec Central Limit Order Book is a dealer-to-dealer electronic trading platform operated on CME Globex.  BrokerTec Quote is a Request For Quote platform provided on third-party technology, that offers a dealer-to-client trading solution for the global government bond repo (including Emerging Markets) and credit repo markets. BrokerTec Quote also offers securities lending in European debt. BrokerTec Stream is a relationship-based trading platform offering U.S. Treasury instruments.\n6\nTable of Contents\nEBS provides for the trading of global FX products across major and emerging market currencies and Spot Precious Metals. EBS Market is a Central Limit Order Book electronic trading platform for spot FX, Spot Precious Metals and NDFs. EBS Direct is a relationship-based trading platform offering Spot FX, Spot Precious Metals (and previously, FX forwards and FX swaps until the cessation of that business in April 2024).\nMarket Data Business: \nWe offer a variety of market data services through industry-leading market data platforms and third-party distribution partners, which are designed to meet the risk-management, trading, investment and business needs of our global client base. To this end, we provide proprietary real-time and historical market data related to CME Group’s deeply liquid exchanges and cash markets businesses. We further offer derived cash markets pricing, third-party and alternative data sets, as well as a wide range of analytic tools. As customers continue to leverage cloud technology to improve and evolve their businesses, CME Group has taken a leading role by becoming the first derivatives marketplace to provide live market data natively on the Google Cloud. CME Group is also the distributor of leading benchmark equity and commodity indices on behalf of third parties, as well as a distributor and licensor of our own proprietary benchmarks and indices, including CME Term SOFR Reference Rates (CME Term SOFR) and Term €STR Reference Rates, which adhere to the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks and are administered by our U.K. regulated subsidiary, CME Benchmark Administration Limited. \nOur Strategic Initiatives \nThe following is a description of our strategic initiatives:\nMaximize Futures and Options Growth Globally \n— \nWe continue to focus on driving growth and new customer acquisition by expanding, innovating and scaling our core offerings, and increasing participation from customers. We do this by optimizing our global sales team, cross-selling certain products, expanding the strength of our existing benchmark products, launching new products and services, strengthening our existing product and service offerings, securing intellectual property rights to new products, enhancing our relationships and broadening our base of distribution partners, and deepening open interest in our core futures and options offerings.\n \nWe have further focused on building upon cloud-based data distribution capabilities as a more flexible and potentially efficient means of providing data to our clients.\nIn 2024, CME Group futures and options had a record average daily volume \nof 26.5 million contracts\n, with a volume record in our interest rates asset class for the\n third \nconsecutive year. It was also a year of volume records for multiple products, including Treasury futures and Ultra 10 Year Treasury Note futures, SOFR futures, Bitcoin futures, Natural Gas (futures and options), Metals futures and options and a record number of contracts executed via Basis Trade at Index Close (\"BTIC\"). We continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broad and diversified portfolio of benchmark products. Some of our new products introduced over the past year include:\n•\nAdditional Cryptocurrency Reference Rates and Real-Time Indices\n•\nOptions on Euro short-term Rate Futures (€STR)\n•\nE-mini S&P 500 Equal Weight Futures\n•\nEuro-denominated Bitcoin and Ether Futures\n•\nCredit Futures and Repo on Corporate Bonds on BrokerTec\n•\nCBOT Wheat - Euronext Milling Wheat No. 2 Spread futures contract and the KC HRW Wheat - Euronext Milling Wheat No. 2 Spread futures contract\n•\nOptions on Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) Futures\n•\nSpodumene\n•\nYen- and U.S.-dollar denominated micro Nikkei Futures\n•\nOptions on E-mini Select Sector Futures and Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Futures \nIn addition to the individual product launches noted above, we have completed many product extensions across our asset classes, including short-dated options products (Monday options on U.S. Treasury Futures, Tuesday and Thursday options on WTI Crude Oil, Tuesday and Thursday options on Gold, Silver, and Copper, and Bitcoin Friday futures).\nWe continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world with the most broad and diversified portfolio of benchmark products. We believe we have a significant opportunity to expand the participation of our non-U.S. customer base in our markets. Our penetration of these markets lags our development in the U.S., and we believe that there is room for significant growth and development of these financial market\ns. In 2024, approximately 31% of our electronic futures and options volume was from transactions reported as outside the U.S. and approximately 54% of our market data revenue was derived from outside the U.S. We also achieved 17% growth in trading volume during European trading hours and 7% growth during Asia Pacific trading hours in 2024 compared to 2023. We have increased our customer base and continue to target cross-asset opportunities across client segments and across cash and futures platforms, driving sale and generating new client participation across all regions. We have a history of providing customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services position us to help our customers adapt to and comply with new regulations, while enabling them to \n7\nTable of Contents\nefficiently manage their risks.  We continue to add new channel partners to help us expand the reach of CME Group offerings. We have a broad distribution network around the globe comprised of a combination of internal and external channels and proprietary front-end capabilities.\nCME Group continues to introduce tools which assist our clients in managing their risks. The FX and Metals Market Profile Tools on Quant Analytics offer simple and effective methods for clients to compare and contrast our leading FX and metals products and liquidity pools side-by-side, which in turn enables clients to analyze their opportunity to minimize costs and achieve best execution by accessing highly complementary liquidity pools across cash and futures markets. We expect to continue to expand our analytics suite in the future as well. \nIn 2024, we launched €STRWatch to help clients manage risk around European Central Bank (ECB) policy decisions. This tool builds on the success of CME Group’s FedWatch, SOFRWatch and TreasuryWatch tools.  \nCME Group Volatility Indexes (CVOL) comprises a total of 42 indexes, including 7 unique broad-based benchmarks such as the Treasury Volatility Index and Commodity Volatility Index. \nIn 2025, we are planning to launch CME FX Spot+ as another tool for our customers to increase access, transparency and trading opportunities across spot FX and FX futures markets. CME FX Spot+ is an all-to-all spot FX marketplace that will connect liquidity between two trading environments, whereby spot FX participants will have expanded access to CME FX futures liquidity in OTC spot terms within an open, transparent, central limit order book environment, while FX futures market users will have expanded access to OTC FX liquidity.\nWe continue to enhance our retail strategy focusing on the growth of top-tier and large new-to-futures brokers, which resulted in a record number of new retail accounts. Retail remains a core tenet of our new client acquisition strategy, and we are focused on bringing new-to-futures brokers to our markets. \nDiversify our Business and Revenue\n \n- Our acquisition of NEX strengthened our role in global financial markets infrastructure and information services, adding complementary cash, spot, and OTC businesses, and scale to our listed interest rate and FX products, while broadening our global client base. It also further diversified our customer base and relationships outside the U.S. It gave us access to repo customers, and positioned us to grow our repo activity in the U.S. and Europe. It allows us to offer relative value trading solutions for the cash treasury marketplace, and to bring the expanded capabilities of our Globex platform to BrokerTec customers. The transaction expanded CME Group’s position in the large, highly-competitive and highly-fragmented global FX marketplace, offering both order book trading and relationship-based trading solutions for customers. The acquisition added strength in underlying customer marketplaces, especially around regional bank customers and other market participants outside of North America, and expanded our market data solutions beyond futures and options into cash and OTC offerings.  \nCME Group is well-positioned to capitalize on its ability to license CME Term SOFR, administered by our subsidiary, CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. CME Term SOFR is the only SOFR rate endorsed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and the Federal Reserve Board has formally endorsed the forward-looking term rates based on SOFR\n.\nIn 2010, CME Group acquired a majority stake in Dow Jones Indexes, which was combined with S&P’s index business in 2012 to form S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, of which CME Group now has a 27% ownership stake. S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC combines the world class capabilities of the S&P and Dow Jones Indices, and is a significant player in passive investing, including the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry value chain. As part of the joint venture, we acquired a long-term, ownership-linked, exclusive license to list futures and options based on the S&P 500 Index and certain other S&P indices. We also act as the joint venture's licensing agent and distribution services provider. Our acquisition of the IHS Markit indices business (S&P Dow Jones Indices), includes leading fixed income and credit indices, such as iBoxx, iTraxx and CDX.  \nIn 2024, our subsidiary, CME Securities Clearing Inc. (CMESC) filed an application with the SEC to become a Securities Clearing Agency, which would be regulated by the SEC. The goal is for CMESC to help market participants comply with upcoming U.S. Treasury clearing requirements and, ultimately, to position the company to offer additional capital and operational efficiencies to its clients. We are preparing to launch this service following approval from the SEC.\nDeliver Unparalleled Customer Efficiencies and Operational Excellence \n-\n With changing regulatory requirements for many of our customers, including additional margin requirements on uncleared trades, and the need for greater efficiencies, we have added tools to enable customers to manage clearing positions in our markets in an efficient manner. With the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform in the U.S. and in Europe, along with global implementation of Basel III capital requirements on financial institutions, we expect centralized clearing and capital efficiencies to continue to be important for our global client base.\nWe provide a comprehensive multi-asset-class clearing solution to market participants for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing house. Our clearing services offer the ability to optimize collateral \n8\nTable of Contents\nand capital efficiencies across portfolios within the clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives. The majority of our clearing volumes and activities are related to our listed futures and options, which represent the majority of our open interest and collateral held against these positions. We also offer clearing services for OTC interest rate swaps, FX forwards and commodity swaps.\nIn 2023, we launched CME SPAN 2 for certain futures and options on energy products, an enhancement of our Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) margin framework, which provides enhanced risk management capabilities in a single, unified interface across futures and options, cleared OTC products and portfolio margining programs. In 2024, we expanded SPAN 2 to equity products. As CME SPAN 2 is implemented, margins for diversified portfolios will consist of products using the enhanced CME SPAN 2 framework, in addition to the existing SPAN framework, ensuring appropriate levels of offsets will continue to be provided across products subject to the SPAN and SPAN 2 frameworks. \nCME Group provides various tools and services to assist customers with capital and operational efficiencies, including:\n•\nCME Clearing provides compression via coupon blending as well as CME CORE (Clearing Online Risk Engine), an interactive margin calculator that enables clients to optimize their capital by providing insights on margin requirements prior to trading. \n•\nPortfolio margining allows firms to capitalize on margin offsets between futures, options and cleared OTC instruments with common risk factors. \nCross-margining allows firms to achieve portfolio margin efficiencies for offsetting positions between two clearing houses, including CME and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) or CME and Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), through reduced performance bond requirements. Through an enhancement to our arrangement with FICC, in January 2024, we partnered with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and began offering enhanced capital efficiencies to our eligible clearing firms when trading U.S. Treasury securities and CME Interest Rate Futures. With the new arrangement implemented, eligible clearing firms of CME and the Government Securities Division of DTCC's FICC can now cross-margin an expanded suite of products, including CME Group SOFR futures, Ultra 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note futures and Ultra U.S. Treasury Bond futures, with FICC-cleared U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and certain repo transactions. We continue to increase participation with a stable pipeline of additional interested clearing firms, as well as new market participants seeking access to the program.\nPartnership with Google Cloud -\n In November 2021, we announced a 10-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to accelerate CME Group’s move to the cloud, which we expect will transform derivatives markets by expanding access and creating efficiencies for market participants. The partnership will focus on expanding access to CME Group’s infrastructure, advancing real-time data and analytics capabilities, co-innovating new products and services, increasing efficiencies and driving resiliency in the financial markets’ ecosystem. In 2022, we built our cloud instance on the CME Group Google Cloud platform. In 2023, we began executing against the plans to move our non-latency sensitive applications, including clearing and market data, to the CME Group Google Cloud Platform. The migration of these applications will enable a more efficient way for us to commercialize and launch new clearing and data products. \nIn 2024, we began migrating our clearing applications to the Cloud and the majority of the daily clearing cycle processes for futures and options on futures are operating on the Cloud as of the end of 2024. The full migration of clearing processes is expected to be completed in 2025. In 2024, we also announced that Google Cloud will build a private Google Cloud region and co-location facility in Aurora, IL, which will allow our customers to choose their mode(s) of accessing our markets. We continue to make progress in preparing to move the markets. The partnership with Google Cloud allows us to modernize and simplify our architecture, enabling quicker delivery of value for internal and external customers while reducing operational risk and gaining operational efficiencies and maximizing the value of various analytics, including clearing analytics, which we expect we will be able to offer more bro\nadly.\nCME Group and Google Cloud have partnered and begun building a new private Google Cloud region, and a co-location facility, in Aurora, Illinois, which will host Google Cloud's platform designed to support global trading of CME Group's futures and options markets, and offer derivatives traders cloud-based, ultra-low-latency networking, and high-performance computing. \nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses\nWe own the rights to a large number of trademarks, service marks, domain names and trade names in the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world. We have registered many of our most important trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. We hold the rights to a number of patents and have a number of patent applications pending. Our patents cover match engine, trader user interface, trading floor support, market data, general technology and clearing house functionalities. We also own copyrights to a variety of materials. Those copyrights, some of which are registered, include printed and online publications, websites, advertisements, educational materials, graphic presentations and other literature, both textual and electronic. We protect our \n9\nTable of Contents\nintellectual property rights by relying on trademarks, patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, restrictions on disclosure and other methods.\nWe offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks, including S&P, Nasdaq, Dow Jones, FTSE Russell and fixed income index futures. These products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes, some of which are exclusive. In connection with S&P Dow Jones Indices, we have a license agreement (S&P License Agreement) for certain S&P stock indices and related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are indexed to certain S&P stock indices. Our license for the S&P 500 Index will be exclusive for futures and options until one year prior to the termination of the S&P License Agreement, and non-exclusive for the last year. The license for the other S&P stock indices is generally exclusive for futures and options. The term of the S&P License Agreement will continue until the date that is one year after the date that CME Group ceases to own at least 5% (accounting for dilution) of the outstanding interests in S&P Dow Jones Indices. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain terminations of the joint venture, the term may be extended up to an additional ten years. In connection with S&P Dow Jones Indices, we also have an exclusive license agreement (Dow Jones License Agreement) for certain Dow Jones indices. The initial term of the agreement is through June 30, 2026. Following the initial term, the Dow Jones License Agreement will automatically renew for renewal terms of five years thereafter, so long as there is open interest in any of CBOT’s or its affiliates’ products based on one or more of the Dow Jones licensed indices. In the event there is no open interest in any such products, then we may terminate the agreement. We also have an exclusive license agreement for certain Nasdaq indices through 2029. In 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with FTSE Russell and launched the E-mini Russell 2000 futures in 2017. We pay the applicable third-party a revenue share under the terms of these licensing agreements. A copy of the S&P License Agreement has been filed as a material contract. \nAdditionally, CME Group is the distributor of CME Term SOFR, a daily set of forward-looking interest rate estimates, calculated and published for 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenors and administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited, a U.K. regulated subsidiary. \n \nWe cannot guarantee we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with S&P, Dow Jones, Nasdaq and FTSE Russell or be able to maintain existing exclusive and non-exclusive licensing arrangements beyond the term of the current agreements or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable to us. In addition, we cannot guarantee that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we own or have obtained by license, or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments, including securities and options based on the S&P, Dow Jones, Nasdaq or FTSE Russell indices, to manage or speculate on U.S. stock risks or that clients select another interest rate alternative. Parties also may succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license, or in countries that are beyond our and/or our licensors' jurisdictional reach.\nCompetition \nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has seen multiple new entrants over time, and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global, especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), EMIR 3.0, Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), Capital Requirements Directive IV, Market Abuse Regulation, Benchmarks Regulation, Basel III and various other laws and regulations.\nPlease also refer to the discussion below and in\n \"",
  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:\n•\nExecutive Summary\n: Includes an overview of our business; current economic, competitive and regulatory trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenses.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies\n: Provides an explanation of accounting policies that may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies.\n•\nResults of Operations\n: Includes an analysis of our 2024 financial results and a discussion of any known events or trends that are likely to impact future results.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements.\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to \"we\" and \"our\" are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to \"exchange\" are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), collectively, unless otherwise noted. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBusiness Overview\nCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, NEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol \"CME.\" \nOur exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options contracts. We also clear futures, options and swaps contracts through our clearing house. Futures contracts, options contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. \nWe are a global company with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. \nWe offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options contracts on a range of products, including those based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, metals and agricultural commodities. Through our cash markets business, we offer fixed income trading through BrokerTec and foreign currency trading through EBS. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. \nMost of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. \nOur clearing house clears, settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared swaps products. Our clearing house's performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies. Certain BrokerTec contracts are cleared at third-party clearing houses. \nBusiness Trends\nEconomic Environment. \nOur customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs. Trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the \n32\nTable of Contents\nFederal Reserve Bank’s interest rate policy. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services, which support our customers in any economic environment.  \nCompetitive Environment.\n Our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of ongoing regulatory development in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by our brand and reputation; the efficiency and security of our clearing, settlement and support services; depth and liquidity of our markets; capital and margin efficiencies; diversity of product offerings, including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services; our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs; efficient and seamless customer experience; transparency, reliability, anonymity and security of transaction processing; the regulatory environment; connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods, and distribution; and technology capability and innovation, as well as overall transaction costs. We believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors.  Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. We compete in a large and expanding financial services trading, clearing and settlement marketplace globally. As markets continue to evolve, we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. The competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in \"Item 1 - Business\" beginning o\nn page \n10\n.\nRegulatory Environment.\n Our exchange-traded derivatives exchanges and other businesses are regulated and we serve a customer base that includes regulated institutions and individuals. Developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business. Compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources, which could advers\nely affect our profitability. The regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in \"Item 1 - Business\" beginning on page \n12\n.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally, diversifying our business and revenues and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence, including through our partnership with Google Cloud. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. Our strategic initiatives are discussed in \"Item 1 - Business\" beginning o\nn page \n7\n. \nRevenues\nClearing and transaction fees.\n A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty. \nWhile volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: \n•\nrate structure;\n•\nproduct mix;\n•\nvenue; and\n•\nthe percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.\nRate structure. \nCustomers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. \nProduct mix. \nWe offer exchange-traded futures and options contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate swap contracts. We also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products. \nVenue. \nOur exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of \n33\nTable of Contents\ncustomers or for themselves. Beginning in July 2023, open outcry trading is now limited to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) options products following the permanent closure of most of our open outcry pits. \nTypically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. \nMember/non-member mix. \nGenerally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. \nClearing and transaction fees for cash markets business\n. Our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a third-party clearing house. We are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service. BrokerTec Americas also generates revenue from a matched principal business. This business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on our electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. Revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis. \nOther sources. \nRevenue is also derived from other sources, including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations. \nMarket data and information services. \nWe receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. \nOur service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.\nPricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. \nOther revenues. \nOther revenue includes access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. \nOther revenues also include fees for collateral management, equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms.\nExpenses\nThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes. \nCompensation and benefits. \nCompensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category. \nThe bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities. \nIn general, stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards \n34\nTable of Contents\nand other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. \nProfessional fees and outside services.\n This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.\nDepreciation and amortization. \nDepreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. \nAmortization of purchased intangibles. \nAmortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of CBOT Holdings, Inc., NYMEX Holdings, Inc. and NEX as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships. \nOther expenses. \nWe incur additional ongoing expenses for technology, licensing and other fee agreements and various other activities necessary to support our operations. \n•\nTechnology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. It also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be driven by system capacity, cloud consumption, functionality and redundancy requirements. It also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the U.S. to access our electronic platforms directly. \n•\nLicensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products. This expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products, as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures. \n•\nOther expenses include occupancy and building operations expenses including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs related to leased property in Chicago, New York, the U.K., and India, as well as other smaller locations throughout the world. Other expenses also include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of certain operating assets, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities. \n•\nInvestment income includes income from short-term investment of clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash; interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; realized gains and losses and dividend income from our strategic equity investments, and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations. \n•\nInterest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities, including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements.\n•\nEquity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, OSTTRA, Shanghai CFETS-NEX International Money Broking Co., Ltd. and Gulf Mercantile Exchange.\n•\nOther income (expense) includes expenses related to the distribution of a portion of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms, gains and losses on derivative contracts and other various income and expenses outside our core operations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs. \nValuation of financial instruments. \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized  financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: \n•\nLevel 1 inputs, which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value, consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. \n•\nLevel 2 inputs consist of observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. \n•\nLevel 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs, which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entity-specific inputs.\nFor further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and note 17. Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. \nGoodwill and intangible assets. \nWe review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions; and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill, as denominated in foreign currencies, is adjusted each reporting period as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Such foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity.\nWe also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.\nIntangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets. \nRevenue recognition. \nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are \n36\nTable of Contents\nrecognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched, novated and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. We also earn revenue from the dissemination of market data to subscribers, distributors, and other third-party licensees of market data. Market data and information services fee revenue is generally recognized on a monthly basis as the customers receive and consume the benefit of the market data services. \nIncome taxes.\n Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year, as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage third-party expertise where appropriate. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. \nInternal use software costs.\n Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized.  We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained or developed in the cloud. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred, while certain costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally two to four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. In addition, software assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that a reduction in the estimated useful lives is warranted.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented. For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2022, see \"Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nTotal revenues\n$\n6,130.1 \n$\n5,578.9 \n10 \n%\nTotal expenses\n2,198.6 \n2,143.2 \n3 \nOperating margin\n64.1 \n%\n61.6 \n%\nNon-operating income (expense)\n$\n609.9 \n$\n717.9 \n(15)\nEffective tax expense rate\n22.4 \n%\n22.3 \n%\nNet income attributable to CME Group\n$\n3,525.8 \n$\n3,226.2 \n9 \nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to CME Group\n9.67 \n8.86 \n9 \nCash flows from operating activities\n3,690.5 \n3,453.8 \n7 \n37\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nClearing and transaction fees\n$\n4,988.2 \n$\n4,588.5 \n9 \n%\nMarket data and information services\n710.2 \n663.7 \n7 \nOther\n431.7 \n326.7 \n32 \nTotal Revenues\n$\n6,130.1 \n$\n5,578.9 \n10 \nClearing and Transaction Fees\nFutures and Options\n \nThe following table summarizes our total contract volume, revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options. Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps. \n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n \n \n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nTotal contract volume (in millions)\n6,685.0 \n6,098.5 \n10 \n%\nClearing and transaction fees (in millions)\n$\n4,623.3 \n$\n4,220.8 \n10 \nAverage rate per contract\n0.692 \n0.692 \n— \nWe estimate the following net increase in clearing and transaction fees based on a change in total contract volume and a change in average rate per contract during 2024 compared with 2023.\n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(in millions)\n2024-2023\nIncrease due to change in total contract volume\n$\n405.7 \nDecrease due to change in average rate per contract\n(3.2)\nNet increase in clearing and transaction fees\n$\n402.5 \nAverage rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, including volume-based incentives, product mix, trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.\n38\nTable of Contents\nContract Volume\nThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition. \n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nAverage Daily Volume by Product Line:\nInterest rates\n13,716\n12,517\n10 \n%\nEquity indexes\n6,847\n6,698\n2 \nForeign exchange\n1,030\n954\n8 \nAgricultural commodities\n1,711\n1,508\n13 \nEnergy\n2,488\n2,118\n17 \nMetals\n736\n599\n23 \nAggregate average daily volume\n26,528\n24,394\n9 \nAverage Daily Volume by Venue:\nCME Globex\n24,510\n22,353\n10 \nOpen outcry\n1,023\n1,145\n(11)\nPrivately negotiated \n995\n896\n11 \nAggregate average daily volume\n26,528\n24,394\n9 \nElectronic Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume\n92 \n%\n92 \n%\nMarket volatility within certain financial markets remained high throughout 2024. Interest rate volatility was higher as a result of mixed inflation levels and market uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions.  The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) cut the federal funds rate multiple times throughout 2024 and issued cautious guidance for the future. In addition, the energy markets saw an increase in volatility as a result of continued geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe as well as more weather uncertainty in 2024 compared to 2023. We also expanded our ongoing sales efforts across many of the product lines to increase our sales growth across the globe. We believe these factors contributed to the increase in total volume in 2024 compared with 2023.\nInterest Rate Products\nThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products. We no longer offer Eurodollar contract trading as of June 2023.\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nEurodollar futures and options:\nFutures expiring within two years\n—\n87\n(100)\n%\nOptions\n—\n41\n(100)\nFutures expiring beyond two years\n—\n21\n(100)\nSOFR futures and options:\nFutures expiring within two years\n2,654\n2,545\n4 \nFutures expiring beyond two years\n957\n850\n13 \nOptions\n1,580\n1,726\n(8)\nU.S. Treasury futures and options:\n10-Year\n3,248\n2,701\n20 \n5-Year\n1,977\n1,834\n8 \n2-Year\n1,044\n838\n25 \nTreasury Bond\n714\n587\n22 \nUltra T-Bond\n415\n312\n33 \nFederal Funds futures and options\n414\n442\n(6)\n39\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024 compared with 2023, overall interest rate contract volume increased as a result of general market uncertainty. We believe this was a result of mixed inflation results that occurred throughout the year, as well as the U.S. presidential and congressional elections in November. We also believe there was uncertainty regarding the Federal Reserve's interest policy decisions. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in 2024 and issued cautious guidance for 2025. The increase in overall interest rate contract volume was also due to our ongoing sales efforts to increase global participation. \nEquity \nIndex Products\nThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products. \n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nE-mini S&P 500 futures and options\n4,016\n4,154\n(3)\n%\nE-mini Nasdaq 100 futures and options\n \n2,065\n1,829\n13 \nE-mini Russell 2000 futures and options\n308\n316\n(2)\nEquity index contract volume increased slightly in 2024 compared with 2023. We believe the increase in Nasdaq-100 contract volume was due to higher volatility within the technology sector as a result of market speculation about artificial intelligence initiatives. The increase in volume was partially offset by lower overall equity volatility within the S&P 500, which is more diversified than the tech heavy Nasdaq-100. We also believe the increase in volume is due our additional client outreach efforts throughout the year.\nForeign Exchange Products\nThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products.\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nEuro\n258\n252\n2 \n%\nJapanese yen\n192\n185\n4 \nBritish pound\n120\n111\n8 \nAustralian dollar\n114\n106\n8 \nOverall foreign exchange contract volume increased in 2024 when compared with 2023, which we believe is due to uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve and other global central banks' interest rate policy decisions. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in 2024, but issued cautious guidance moving forward as a result of continued uncertainty surrounding inflation. We believe these factors led to higher overall foreign exchange contract volume in 2024 compared with 2023. \nAgricultural Commodity Products\nThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products.\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nCorn\n511\n444\n15 \n%\nSoybean\n367\n319\n15 \nWheat \n228\n208\n10 \nIn 2024 when compared with 2023, overall commodity contract volume increased due to higher overall market volatility. We believe this is a result of continued weather uncertainty due to a drier than average 2024 growing season. In addition, poor weather conditions throughout the Black Sea region led to increased uncertainty surrounding soybean and wheat yields. We also believe the increase in volume is due to our initiatives to increase cross selling among key customers and optimization of our incentive programs to promote volume growth of new and existing products.\n40\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Products\nThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products.\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nWTI crude oil\n1,167\n1,087\n7 \n%\nNatural gas\n811\n601\n35 \nRefined products\n375\n336\n12 \nOverall energy contract volume increased in 2024 when compared with 2023. We believe the increase in volume is due to uncertainty in the global energy markets caused by multiple geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.  In addition, uncertain weather conditions throughout the year led to an increase in overall natural gas volume. We also believe the increase in volume is due our additional client outreach efforts throughout the year.\nMetal Products\nThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products.\nYear-over-Year Change\n(amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nGold\n431\n356\n21 \n%\nCopper\n133\n114\n17 \nSilver\n123\n93\n33 \nOverall metal contract volume increased in 2024 when compared with 2023, which we believe was attributable to higher overall market volatility. Market uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions as well as uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential and congressional elections led to an overall increase in demand for gold and other precious metals as safe-haven investments. In addition, copper contract volume increased largely due to an increase in demand for artificial intelligence data centers and renewable infrastructure. We also believe the increase in volume was due to increased sales efforts, specifically with retail clients and our international sales efforts for copper products. \nAverage Rate per Contract\nThe average rate per contract remained consistent in 2024 when compared with 2023. The average rate per contract was impacted by an increase in our fee structure, which went into effect on February 1, 2024. The overall increase due to the rise in fees was offset by a decrease resulting from higher member trading as a percentage of total volume as well as our tiered volume pricing structure. \nCash Markets Business\nTotal clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2024 included $276.7 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business, compared with\n $284.7 million in \n2023.

The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One clearing firm represented at lea\nst 10%\n of \nour clearing and transaction fees in 2024. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trad\ning activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. \nOther Sources of Revenue\nMarket data and information services. \nIn 2024 when compared with 2023, the increase in market data and information services revenue was largely attributable to price increases for certain products as well as an increase in usage for certain products.\nApproximately 30% of our market data and information services revenue in 2024 was earned from the two largest resellers of our market data. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer distributes our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.\nOther revenues\n. In 2024 when compared with 2023, the increase in other revenue was largely attributable to higher custody fees as well as an increase in co-location and other connectivity fees.\nExpenses\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nCompensation and benefits\n$\n850.3 \n$\n828.6 \n3 \n%\nTechnology\n255.8 \n218.7 \n17 \nProfessional fees and outside services\n132.7 \n144.4 \n(8)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n221.7 \n226.6 \n(2)\nDepreciation and amortization\n115.1 \n126.0 \n(9)\nLicensing and other fee agreements\n355.4 \n322.8 \n10 \nOther\n267.6 \n276.1 \n(3)\nTotal Expenses\n$\n2,198.6 \n$\n2,143.2 \n3 \n42\nTable of Contents\n2024 Compared With 2023\nOperating expenses increased by $55.4 million in 2024 when compared with 2023.

In 2024 when compared with 2023, there was a decrease in earnings from reinvested cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions due to lower average reinvestment balances. In 2024 and 2023, earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions we\nre $3,943.8 million \nand $5,073.9 million, respectively. In addition, there was a decrease in net realized and unrealized gains on investments.\nEquity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. \nHigher income generated from our S&P/DJI and OSTTRA business ventures contributed to an increase in equity in net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2024 when compared with 2023.\nOther income (expense).\n In 2024 when compared with 2023, we recognized lower expense related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestments to the clearing firms in conjunction with lower interest income earned on our reinvestment during the period due to lower average reinvestment balances in 2024. In 2024 and 2023, expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on collateral reinvestments were\n $3,669.4 million a\nnd $4,717.5 million, respectively. \n43\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented:\n \n2024\n2023\nYear-over-Year Change\n2024-2023\nYear ended December 31\n22.4 \n%\n22.3 \n%\n0.1 \n%\nThe overall effective tax rate remained relatively consistent in 2024 when compared with the same period in 2023.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Requirements\nWe have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. However, we have used our commercial paper program from time to time to fund large short-term funding needs.  While our cost structure is generally fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels. In addition to using our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations, we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other commitments. It is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities.\nCash will also be required for non-cancellable purchase obligations as at December 31, 2024. Commitments include material contractual purchase obligations that are non-cancellable. Purchase obligations relate to advertising, licensing, hardware, software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Aside from the table below, we have certain other arrangements that have a perpetual term for which we pay a minimum of $5.0 million per year.  At December 31, 2024, future minimum payments due under purchase obligations were payable as follows (in millions): \nYear\n \n2025\n$\n176.5 \n2026-2027\n382.7 \n2028-2029\n377.2 \nThereafter\n350.0 \nTotal\n$\n1,286.4 \nFuture capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity, performance improvements, integration of acquired platforms and improvements to some of our office spaces. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and modification of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2025, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately\n $90.0 million, n\net of any leasehold improvement allowances. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. \nIn December 2024, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of CME Group Class A common stock at prevailing market prices. As of December 31, 2024, there have been no shares repurchased under this program.\nWe intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders, with a target of between 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. We are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of our state of incorporation, which could limit our ability to declare and pay dividends.\n On February 6, 2025, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend\n of\n $1.25 per sh\nare for all outstanding common and preferred shares. The dividend will be payable on March 26, 2025 to shareholders of record on March 7, 2025. \nAssuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $455.0 million. \nThe board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $5.80 per share on December 5, 2024 paid on January 16, 2025 to the shareholders of record on December 27, 2024. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined at the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, capital expenditures, potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return, including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year. \n44\nTable of Contents\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\n \n \n \nYear-over-Year Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024-2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,690.5 \n$\n3,453.8 \n7 \n%\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n(82.6)\n20.9 \nn.m.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n5,076.5 \n(48,339.3)\n(111)\n_________\nn.m. not meaningful\nOperating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was higher in 2024 compared with 2023, largely due to an increase in revenue resulting from fee increases and an increase in overall volumes. \nInvesting activities\nThe increase in cash used in investing activities in 2024 compared with 2023 was due to lower overall proceeds on sales of investments in 2024 compared to 2023. In addition, the increase in cash used was also due to higher additions in property, plant and equipment. \nFinancing activities\nCash provided by financing activities was higher in 2024 when compared with 2023 mainly due to an increase in cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions. This was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid in 2024. \nDebt Instruments\nThe following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024:\n(in millions)\nPar Value\nFixed rate notes due March 2025, stated rate of 3.00%\n (1)\n$\n750.0 \nFixed rate notes due June 2028, stated rate of 3.75%\n500.0 \nFixed rate notes due March 2032, stated rate of 2.65%\n750.0 \nFixed rate notes due September 2043, stated rate of 5.30%\n (2)\n750.0 \nFixed rate notes due June 2048, stated rate of 4.15%\n700.0 \n _______________\n(1)\nWe maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.11%.\n(2)\nWe maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.73%.\nWe maintain a $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which matures in November 2026. The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to $3.3 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2021, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but any commercial paper balance if or when outstanding can be backstopped against this facility.\nWe maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by the clearing house. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event a clearing firm fails to promptly discharge an obligation to the clearing house, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms, or in other cases as provided by the CME rulebook. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the \n45\nTable of Contents\nform of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets (pursuant to the CME rulebook) can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2024, guaranty fund contributions available to collateralize the facility totaled\n $10.1 billion. \nWe have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME's consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $800.0 million. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility. \nThe indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for $7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. \nAt December 31, 2024, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximatel\ny $2.3 billion \nunder our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility.\nWe maintain committed repurchase facility agreements amounting to a total of $1.0 billion.  The committed repurchase facilities provide access to cash, secured by non-cash collateral, in the event that one or more of our clearing firms fails to promptly discharge an obligation to the clearing house.  The facilities are subject to annual renewal. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities.\nWe maintain a committed facility of up to $750.0 million for foreign currency conversions. The committed foreign currency facility allows the clearing house to convert cash to another currency within generally accepted local market timeframes in the event that one or more of our clearing firms fails to promptly discharge an obligation to the clearing house.  The facility is subject to annual renewal. We currently do not have any foreign currency trades outstanding under this facility.\nAt December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities.\nCME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide the funds that it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nTo satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge irrevocable standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2024, the letters of credit totaled \n$400.0\n million. We also maintain a $350.0 million line of credit to meet our obligations under this agreement.\nThe following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2024: \nRating Agency\nShort-Term\nDebt Rating\nLong-Term\nDebt Rating\nOutlook\nStandard & Poor’s\nA1+\nAA-\nStable\nMoody’s Investors Service\nP1\nAa3\nStable\nGiven our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade within certain specified time periods due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. No report of any rating agency is incorporated by reference herein.\nLiquidity and Cash Management\nCash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $2.9 billion at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our corporate investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash performance bonds and guarantee fund contribution assets are deemed to be restricted cash. \nOur practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax de\nduction. Base\nd on our actuarial projections, we estimate that a $12.2 million additional contribution will be necessary in 2025 to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2025 and the December 31, 2025 discount rate. \n46\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Requirements \nCME is regulated by the CFTC as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As a result, CME must comply with CFTC regulations applicable to a systemically important DCO for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements.\nCME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as designated contract markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements. \nBrokerTec Americas LLC is required to maintain sufficient net capital under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule). The Net Capital Rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties, and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. Rule 15c3-3, or the customer protection rule, which complements Rule 15c3-1, is designed to ensure that customer property (securities and funds) in the custody of broker-dealers is adequately safeguarded. By law, both of these rules apply to the activities of registered broker-dealers, but not to unregistered affiliates. The firm began operating as a (k)(2)(i) broker-dealer in November 2017 following notification to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the SEC. A company operating under the (k)(2)(i) exemption is not required to lock up customer funds as would otherwise be required under Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3.",
