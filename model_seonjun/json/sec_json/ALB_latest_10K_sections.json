We also offer our customers recycling services for lithium-containing by-products resulting from synthesis with organolithium products, lithium metal and other reagents. We plan to continue to focus on the development of new products and applications.\nCompetition\nThe global lithium market is highly competitive and growing very rapidly. It is characterized by aggressive expansion and entry from existing and new players, including automotive OEMs, commodity traders, junior miners, and large, well-capitalized diversified miners. Producers are primarily located in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia. Major competitors in lithium compounds include Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A., Sichuan Tianqi Lithium, Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium, Rio Tinto plc, Pilbara Minerals, Arcadium Lithium, Tesla and a large number of additional Chinese companies. Competition in the global lithium market is increasingly based on index-based market pricing and differentiated via product quality, product diversity, reliability of supply and customer service.\n3\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\nWe obtain lithium: (a) by purchasing lithium concentrate from our 49%-owned joint venture, Windfield Holdings Pty. Ltd. (“Windfield”), which directly owns 100% of the equity of Talison Lithium Pty. Ltd., a company incorporated in Australia (“Talison”) that owns the Greenbushes mine, and from our 50%-owned unincorporated joint venture, MARBL Lithium Joint Venture (“MARBL”) in Western Australia, which owns the Wodgina hard rock lithium mine project (“Wodgina”); and (b) through solar evaporation of our ponds at the Salar de Atacama, in Chile, and in Silver Peak, Nevada. In addition, we hold mineral rights in defined areas of Kings Mountain, North Carolina with available lithium resources and we own undeveloped land with access to a lithium resource in Antofalla, within the Catamarca Province of Argentina. See Item 2. Properties, for additional disclosures of our lithium mineral properties.\nSpecialties Segment\nOur Specialties business optimizes our portfolio of bromine and highly specialized lithium solutions. Our Specialties business serves a variety of industries, including energy, mobility, connectivity, and health. Specialty products are essential in both internal combustion and electric vehicles, from high-voltage cables and powertrains to airbags and tires. We enable digital innovation focused on safety and reliability, including fire safety compounds.

In energy, infrastructure for renewable grid and electrified transport is enabled by our fire safety solutions. In health, our lithium specialties products are precursors for many pharmaceuticals, while bromine specialties are used to help ensure safer food and water supplies. Other bromine-based specialty chemicals products include elemental bromine, alkyl bromides, inorganic bromides, brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals. Our value-added lithium specialties products include butyllithium and lithium aluminum hydride. We also develop and manufacture cesium products for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and zirconium, barium and titanium products for various pyrotechnical applications, including airbag initiators. A number of customers of our Specialties business operate in cyclical industries, including the consumer electronics and oil field industries. As a result, demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical.\nCompetition\nOur Specialties business serves markets in the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, each of which is highly competitive. Product performance and quality, price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract. R&D, product and process improvements, specialized customer services, the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the marketplace. Our most significant competitors are Lanxess AG, Israel Chemicals Ltd and Arcadium Lithium, as well as producers in India and China.\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\nThe bromine we use is originally sourced from two locations: Arkansas and the Dead Sea. Our bromine production operations in Arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program. In addition, through our 50% interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited (“JBC”), a consolidated joint venture established in 1999 with operations in Safi, Jordan, we acquire bromine that is originally sourced from the Dead Sea. JBC processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products. See Item 2. Properties, for additional disclosures for our mineral properties. The lithium concentrate used in our lithium specialties products are originally sourced from the same sources as the Energy Storage lithium concentrate noted above.\nKetjen Segment\nOur three main product lines in this segment are (i) Clean Fuels Technologies (“CFT”), which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts (“HPC”) together with isomerization and alkylation catalysts; (ii) fluidized catalytic cracking (“FCC”) catalysts and additives; and (iii) performance catalyst solutions (“PCS”), which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives. \nWe offer a wide range of HPC products, which are applied throughout the oil refining industry. Their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur, nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock. In addition, they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes. We continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering HPC products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market. \n4\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nWe provide our customers with customized FCC catalyst systems, which assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative, higher-value products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene. Our FCC additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in FCC units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield, such as propylene, and to boost octane in gasoline. Ketjen offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs.\nWithin our PCS product line, we manufacture organometallic co-catalysts (e.g., aluminum, magnesium, and zinc alkyls) used in the manufacture of alpha-olefins (e.g., hexene, octene, decene), polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), and electronics. Our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes, epoxies and other engineered resins.\nThere were more than 700 refineries world-wide as of December 31, 2024. We expect to continue to see some less profitable, typically smaller, refineries shutting down and, over the long-term, being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries, with growth concentrated in the Middle East, India and South-East Asia. Advances in sustainable aviation fuels, petroleum products and renewable diesel are expected to continue. We estimate that there are currently approximately 600 FCC units being operated globally, each of which requires a constant supply of FCC catalysts. In addition, we estimate that there are approximately 4,000 HPC units being operated globally, each of which typically requires replacement HPC catalysts once every one to four years.\nCompetition\nOur Ketjen segment serves the global market including the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, each of which is highly competitive. Competition in these markets is driven by a variety of factors. Product performance, quality, price, contract terms, product and process improvements, specialized customer services, the ability to attract and retain skilled technical support, and the maintenance of a good safety record are the primary factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace. In addition, through our research and development programs, we strive to differentiate our business by developing value-added products based on proprietary technologies.\nOur major competitors in the CFT catalysts market include Shell Catalysts & Technologies, Advanced Refining Technologies and Haldor Topsoe. Our major competitors in the FCC catalysts market include W.R. Grace & Co. and BASF Corporation. In the PCS market, our major competitors include Nouryon, Lanxess AG and Arxada.\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\nThe major raw materials we use in our Ketjen operations include sodium silicate, sodium aluminate, kaolin, aluminum, ethylene, alpha-olefins, isobutylene, toluene and metals, such as lanthanum, molybdenum, nickel and cobalt, most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools, as appropriate, to mitigate price volatility.\nHuman Capital\nOur main human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe, supported and empowered to do the best work they can do. We believe providing an inclusive workplace facilitates opportunities for innovation, fosters good decision-making practices, and promotes employee engagement and high productivity across our organization.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 8,300 employees, including employees of our consolidated joint ventures, of whom 3,300, or 39%, are employed in the U.S. and the Americas; 2,900, or 35%, are employed in Asia Pacific; 1,500, or 19%, are employed in Europe; and 600, or 7%, are employed in the Middle East or other areas. Approximately 28% of these employees are represented by unions or works councils. We strive to foster positive relationships with our employees and their representatives.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is a part of our core values at Albemarle and is integral to how we conduct business. Our employees, contractors, and visitors are instructed to follow a comprehensive set of written health and safety policies and procedures at both corporate and local sites. Our internal incident and issues management system gives all employees the ability to report incidents anonymously without fear of retaliation, and allow us to be more proactive in developing safety programs that address at-risk conditions or behaviors, which could lead to an incident. We routinely audit ourselves against our policies, procedures and standards, using internal and third-party resources. We also include health and safety metrics in our annual incentive plan to further incentivize our employees’ commitment to safety. In 2024, we maintained \n5\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nour Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) occupational injury and illness incident rate of 0.13 for our employees and nested contractors, compared to 0.14 in 2023. In addition, we provide all employees and their dependents with access to our Employee Assistance Program, which provides free mental and behavioral health resources.\nTalent and Culture\nInvesting in talent is a critical process for Albemarle because it allows us to be proactive and anticipate key organizational needs for talent and capabilities. This enables us to efficiently and effectively ensure that we have the right talent pipeline to drive Albemarle’s success into the future. We also provide leadership development through performance coaching, comprehensive feedback, plant training including health, safety and environmental topics, and experiential development and mentoring. Our leadership development is a cornerstone to our talent management strategy. We also invest in our people through enhanced training and development opportunities and by seeking to foster an equitable workplace and an inclusive culture that enables employees to feel a sense of belonging and reach their full potential.\nIt is important for us to have a workforce of highly engaged employees who understand how their work connects to Albemarle’s purpose and values. We have measured employee engagement through an empowerment survey, which tracks job satisfaction and how likely an employee is to recommend Albemarle to people they know. In addition, we are committed to empowering and supporting the next generation of talent in their career development by engaging in various initiatives to attract people from all backgrounds to our internship, co-op and rotational development programs. \nOur incentive program is designed to provide incentives and rewards for achieving Albemarle’s annual goals and objectives. The Executive Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Board has the overall responsibility of evaluating the performance of the CEO and approving the compensation structure for senior management and other key employees. The Executive Compensation and Talent Development Committee determines performance goals under our incentive program annually to ensure our executive officers execute on short-term financial and strategic initiatives that drive our business strategy and long-term shareholder value.\nWe develop holistic inclusion and belonging initiatives to foster a values-driven workplace where all individuals feel a sense of belonging as they grow in their professions. We continue to pursue strategies and partnerships to attract highly qualified applicants from all backgrounds, offer cross-cultural learning sessions for our employees, and assess promotion, retention, and turnover data to identify potential opportunities for greater inclusion efforts. \nWe seek to provide employees with a desirable workplace that will enable us to attract and retain top talent. We believe employees should be fairly compensated through wages and benefits, based on experience, expertise, performance, and the criticality of their roles in the Company. We also perform an annual review of our pay practices to ensure that they are fair and equitable. In addition, we have established employee resource groups, known as Connect groups, to promote an atmosphere of inclusion and encouragement in which every employee’s voice can be heard. These Connect groups provide opportunities for employees to share their backgrounds and experiences, and to use them to benefit others through mentoring and volunteering in the local community, among other activities.\nHuman Rights\nAlbemarle is guided by its Code of Conduct, which sets forth the high ethical standards we have for all employees and encourages a ‘Speak Up’ culture. We understand our responsibility to uphold the human rights of our employees, workers in our supply chain, members of our communities and other stakeholders. We recognize the human rights of our stakeholders as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We acknowledge the human rights of Indigenous Peoples in culturally sensitive locations, such as Chile and Western Australia, where our sites are located on Indigenous Peoples’ lands through clear policy commitments, due diligence initiatives, formal community agreements and accessible grievance mechanisms for reporting concerns.\nAlbemarle offers multiple avenues for employees and stakeholders to raise concerns. We maintain internal investigation standards to thoroughly review and address concerns that may arise. We take measures to maintain confidentiality, protect the integrity of all investigations, and prevent retaliation against those who speak up in good faith. In conducting investigations, we are committed to the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\nSales, Marketing and Distribution\nWe have an international strategic account program that uses cross-functional teams to serve large global customers. This program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating \n6\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nvalue for customers and promoting post-sale service. Complementing this program are regional Albemarle sales and technical personnel who serve our global customer base. We also utilize sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas when necessary or required by law.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that in order to generate revenue growth, maintain our margins and remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, product and process improvements and specialized customer services. Our research and development efforts support each of our business segments. The objective of our research and development efforts is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets through both process and new product development. Through research and development, we continue to seek increased margins by introducing value-added products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies. Our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy, avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes. Green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments.\nIntellectual Property\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, licenses and trade names, is an important component of our business. As of December 31, 2024, we owned more than 1,650 active patents and more than 400 pending patent applications in key strategic markets worldwide. We also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses, and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nRegulation\nOur business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations, including those under the OSHA. We also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our non-U.S. operations. We devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees, and we maintain an active health, safety and environmental program. We finished 2024 with an OSHA occupational injury and illness incident rate of 0.13 for Albemarle employees and nested contractors, compared to 0.14 in 2023.\nOur business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). REACH imposes obligations on European Union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern, as defined under REACH, are subject to an authorization process. Authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product. REACH regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the European Union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH regulations.\nThe Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), as amended in June 2016, requires chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and calls for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. This regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state level, as well as initiatives in Canada, Asia and other regions, will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products.\nHistorically, there has been scrutiny of certain brominated fire safety solutions by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries. We manufacture a broad range of brominated fire safety solution products, which are used in a variety of applications. Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation.\n7\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us. Key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations. In addition, we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them.\nWe use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury and/or property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment. In addition, some of our current properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes, which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation, personal injury and/or property damage. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. We are subject to such laws, including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the U.S., and similar foreign and state laws. We may have liability as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) with respect to active off-site locations under CERCLA or state equivalents. We have sought to resolve our liability as a PRP at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements, which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs. Because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required, and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability, our estimates could change. Moreover, liability under CERCLA and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several, which could require us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other PRPs has been considered, where appropriate, in estimating our liabilities. Accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve. Our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and, based on information currently available to us, we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations.\nSee “Safety and Environmental Matters” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details.\nClimate Change and Natural Resources\nThe growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities. We provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies (such as renewable fuels), pollution control technologies (including mercury emissions), alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions. As demand for, and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of, alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase, we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation.\nIn addition to potential business opportunities, we acknowledge our responsibility to address the impact of our operations on the environment. We are investing in technology and people to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and air emissions. Albemarle supports the goals of the Paris Agreement to avoid climate change by limiting global warming. Our ambition is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have established greenhouse gas emission targets for each of our businesses, including reducing the scope 1 and 2 carbon-intensity of our Specialties and Ketjen businesses by 35% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline), and growing our Energy Storage business in a carbon-intensity neutral manner through 2030.\nWater is a critical input to Albemarle’s production operations. As water is a scarce resource, we understand the need to responsibly manage our water consumption not only for the preservation of the environment, but also for the viability of our local communities. We are investing in new process technologies to reduce our water footprint and expand capacity sustainably in locations with high water risk. Our goal is to reduce our intensity of freshwater usage by 25% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline) in areas of high or extremely high water risk, such as Chile and Jordan, as defined by the World Resources Institute.\nOur businesses are dependent on the availability and responsible management of natural resources. We manage our natural resources to operate efficiently and preserve the environment for our local communities and the world. Our natural \n8\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nresource management includes mineral resource transparency with local communities, governments, regulators and other key stakeholders, as well as leveraging industry best practices in lithium production for the assurance of responsible mining. We attempt to maximize the recovery of our extracted minerals and recycle or reuse by-products where possible. In addition, we work with local communities, regulatory agencies and wildlife organizations to preserve and restore land and biodiversity before, during and after all operations commence.\nRecent Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Divestitures\nThe following is a summary of our significant acquisitions and joint venture agreement restructurings over the last three years.\nOn October 18, 2023, the Company closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited (“MRL”). Under the amended agreements, Albemarle acquired the remaining 40% ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia that was jointly owned with MRL through the MARBL joint venture. Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own 50% of Wodgina, and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Albemarle paid MRL approximately $380 million in cash, which includes $180 million of consideration for the remaining ownership of Kemerton as well as a payment for the economic effective date of the transaction being retroactive to April 1, 2022.\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials Co., Ltd. (“Qinzhou”), for approximately $200 million in cash. Qinzhou’s operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has a designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) and produces battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide.\nThese transactions reflect our commitment to investing in future growth of our high priority businesses.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is \nwww.albemarle.com\n.

Our purpose is to enable a more resilient world. We partner to pioneer new ways to move, power, connect, and protect. The end markets we serve include grid storage, automotive, aerospace, conventional energy, electronics, construction, agriculture and food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We believe that our world-class resources with reliable and consistent supply, our leading process chemistry, high-impact innovation, customer centricity and focus on people and plant will enable us to maintain a leading position in the industries in which we operate.\nSecular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio, cost discipline, broad geographic presence and customer-focused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings. We continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative, yet commercially viable, clean energy products and services to the marketplace to contribute to our sustainability-based revenue. For example, our Energy Storage business contributes to the growth of clean miles driven with electric vehicles and more efficient use of renewable energy through grid storage; Specialties enables the prevention of fires starting in electronic equipment, greater fuel efficiency from rubber tires and the reduction of emissions from coal fired power plants; and our Ketjen business enhances the efficiency of natural resources through more usable products from a single barrel of oil, enables safer, greener production of alkylates used to produce more environmentally-friendly fuels, and reduced emissions through cleaner transportation fuels. We believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements, among other factors, position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur, while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment.\n2024 Highlights\n•\nWe announced a comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure to maintain a competitive position, unlock near-term cash flow, further generate long-term financial flexibility and drive long-term value creation. This included a reduction of planned capital expenditures in 2024 to focus on significantly progressed, near completion and in startup projects, while deferring spending on certain projects.\n•\nAs part of the actions to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we have stopped construction of the Kemerton Trains 3 and 4. In addition, we have put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. Kemerton Train 1 will continue to operate and activity around it is currently focused on commercialization efforts.\n•\nWe announced a new operating structure, effective November 1, 2024, that transitions from two core global business units - Energy Storage and Specialities - to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. We will continue to report results across its three existing operating segments: Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen.\n•\nWe entered into a definitive agreement with the BMW Group to deliver battery-grade lithium to enable the automaker to pursue high-performance, premium electric vehicles. This multi-year agreement, which takes effect in 2025, is one of the company’s largest ever globally by volume and value. In addition to supplying the BMW Group with lithium hydroxide, the two companies will partner on technology for safer and more energy dense lithium-ion batteries.\n•\nIn March 2024, the Company raised net cash proceeds of $2.2 billion from the issuance of depositary shares, representing interests of the Company’s Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). The 2,300,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued in respect of the depositary shares have a $1,000 per share liquidation preference.\n•\nEffective January 1, 2024, we changed our definition of adjusted EBITDA for financial accounting and reporting purposes. The updated definition includes our share of the pre-tax earnings of the Windfield joint venture, whereas the prior definition included our share of Windfield earnings net of tax. This calculation is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA used in the leverage financial covenant calculation in the February 2024 amendment to our revolving, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement dated October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”). This presentation more closely represents the materiality and financial contribution of the strategic investment in Windfield to the Company’s earnings, and more closely represents a measure of EBITDA.\n•\nWe proactively amended the 2022 Credit Agreement to modify the financial covenants through June 2026 given the market pricing of lithium. The amended results of the modification (a) temporarily increase the maximum leverage ratio permitted by the covenant; (b) add an interest coverage ratio and temporarily decrease the minimum interest coverage ratio permitted by the covenant; and (c) adjust the calculation of the EBITDA and net debt components that form the basis of the calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio. The amendments include certain other amendments to the 2022 Credit Agreement, including certain limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, share repurchases and common dividends.\n59\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n•\nWe announced an innovative agreement with Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., a leading supplier of building materials, to make beneficial use of extracted limestone material from Albemarle’s proposed Kings Mountain Mine project. This agreement is part of the Company’s plan to resume lithium mining operations at the Kings Mountain Mine in an environmentally and socially responsible manner, including opportunities to repurpose byproduct material and enhance the economic benefits for the surrounding community.\n•\nWe introduced a project plan and submitted several state and federal permit applications for the potential redevelopment of the Kings Mountain Mine, one of the few known hard-rock lithium deposits in the United States. The plan includes the proposed site footprint, primary physical features and details of the mining processes. Pending permitting approval and a final investment decision, the mine is anticipated to produce approximately 420,000 tons of lithium-bearing spodumene concentrate yearly, providing a crucial building block for sustainable transportation and to support key defense applications.\n•\nWe published our 2023 Sustainability Report, \nAll the Elements for a Better World\n, detailing updates on sustainability strategy execution and the important progress made toward achieving our sustainability goals.\n•\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we increased our quarterly dividend for the 30th consecutive year, to $0.405 per share.\n•\nWe recorded net sales of $5.4 billion during 2024; grew Energy Storage volumes by 19% year-over-year.\n•\nCash flows from operations in 2024 were $702.1 million.\nOutlook\nThe current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve. In particular, we believe that the global market for lithium battery and energy storage, particularly for EVs, remains strong, providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity. The other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions, such as slow and uneven global growth, currency exchange volatility, crude oil price fluctuation, a dynamic pricing environment, an ever-changing landscape in electronics, the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards. During the course of 2023 and 2024, lithium index pricing dropped significantly. Amidst these dynamics, and despite recent downward lithium price pressure, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We believe that our businesses remain well-positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets.\nHowever, in order to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we are taking proactive actions, including certain restructuring activities and reducing planned capital expenditures. As part of these actions, we announced a new operating structure, effective November 1, 2024, that transitions from two core global business units to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. We will continue to report results across our three existing operating segments of Energy Storage, Specialities and Ketjen. If lithium index pricing trends further downward or remains at low levels for an extended time, we may need to take additional measures to support growth and financial flexibility, including further restructuring actions.\nAt this time, relating to the current situation in the Middle East, our business operations have continued as normal with some shipping and raw material delays. We are monitoring the situation and will continue to make efforts to protect the safety of our employees and the health of our business.\nEnergy Storage: \nWe expect Energy Storage net sales and profitability to decrease year-over-year in 2025 as lithium market prices are at lower levels compared to 2024. Because many of our contracts being index-referenced and variable-priced, our business is generally aligned with changes in market and index pricing. As a result, increases or further decreases in lithium market pricing could have a material impact on our results. We do expect the lower pricing to be partially offset by higher sales volume driven primarily by additional capacity from La Negra, Chile, Meishan and Qinzhou, China. The Meishan, China lithium conversion plant achieved first commercial sales during the second quarter of 2024. We could record inventory valuation charges in 2025 if lithium prices continue to deteriorate during the projected period of conversion and sale. While we ramp up our new capacity, we will continue to utilize tolling arrangements to meet growing customer demand. Global EV sales are expected to continue to increase over the prior year, driving continued demand for lithium batteries.\n60\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nAs part of the above-mentioned actions to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we have stopped construction of the Kemerton Trains 3 and 4. In addition, we have put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. Kemerton Train 1 will continue to operate and activity around it is currently focused on commercialization efforts.\nOn a longer-term basis, we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plug-in hybrid EVs and full battery EVs increases. This demand for lithium is supported by a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium-ion battery costs, increasing battery performance, continuing significant investments in the battery and EV supply chain by cathode and battery producers and automotive OEMs and favorable global public policy toward e-mobility/renewable energy usage. Our outlook is also bolstered by long-term supply agreements with key strategic customers, reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner, highlighted by our scale, access to geographically diverse, low-cost resources and long-term track record of reliability of supply and operating execution.\nSpecialties: \nWe expect both net sales and profitability to be higher in 2025 year-over-year as we recover from reduced customer demand in certain markets, including consumer and industrial electronics. In addition, we expect to maintain strong demand in other end-markets, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture and oilfield services.\nOn a longer-term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living, widespread digitization, increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety, bromine and lithium specialties products. We are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive production networks to serve all major bromine and lithium specialties consuming products and markets. The combination of our solid, long-term business fundamentals, strong cost position, product innovations and effective management of raw material costs should enable us to manage our business through end-market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets.\nKetjen:\n Total Ketjen results in 2025 are expected to increase year-over-year due to higher revenues. The FCC market is expected to remain stable. HPC demand is project-driven, based on the refineries taking turnarounds.\nOn a longer-term basis, we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels, new refinery start-ups, ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels and the continuous growth in chemical derivatives from petroleum products will be the primary drivers of growth in our Ketjen business. We believe delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry. We also believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world.\nCorporate:\n We continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies. We expect our global effective tax rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the United States, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Pillar Two which became effective in early 2024, and other tax jurisdictions. In 2024, we took actions as part of an effort that will focus on preserving our world-class resource advantages, optimizing our global conversion network, improving our cost competitiveness and efficiency, reducing capital intensity and enhancing our financial flexibility. As part of these measures, we stopped construction or deferred spending on certain capital projects, such as the Kemerton conversion plant noted above. In addition, we will incur severance and other restructuring charges associated with the Company’s transition to a new fully integrated functional operating model.\nActuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations are reflected in Corporate as a component of non-operating pension and OPEB plan costs under mark-to-market accounting. Results for the year ended December 31, 2024 include an actuarial gain of $9.8 million ($7.5 million after income taxes), as compared to a gain of $10.2 million ($8.3 million after income taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint.

Our reportable business segments consist of: (1) Energy Storage, (2) Specialties and (3) Ketjen.\nThe Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the operating segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit (“Non-operating pension and OPEB items”) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs.\n64\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nOur chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) uses adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to assess the ongoing performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources. In addition, the CODM uses adjusted EBITDA for business and enterprise planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company changed its definition of adjusted EBITDA for financial accounting purposes. The updated definition includes Albemarle’s share of the pre-tax earnings of the Windfield joint venture, whereas the prior definition included Albemarle’s share of Windfield earnings net of tax. This calculation is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA used in the leverage financial covenant calculation in the February 9, 2024 amendment to the 2022 Credit Agreement, which is a material agreement for the Company and aligns the information presented to various stakeholders. This presentation more closely represents the materiality and financial contribution of the strategic investment in Windfield to the Company’s earnings, and more closely represents a measure of EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and financing expenses, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. The Company’s updated definition of adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before the proportionate share of Windfield income tax expense, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items on a segment basis. These non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration related costs, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, certain litigation and arbitration costs and charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items. We have reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides additional useful measurements to review the Company’s operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Total adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Total adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net (loss) income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The below segment information also includes a discussion of our segment net sales and adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 to conform to the current year presentation.\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n2024\n%\n2023\n%\n2022\n%\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nNet sales:\nEnergy Storage\n$\n3,015,121 \n56.1 \n%\n$\n7,078,998 \n73.6 \n%\n$\n4,660,945 \n63.7 \n%\n(57)\n%\n52 \n%\nSpecialties\n1,325,983 \n24.6 \n%\n1,482,425 \n15.4 \n%\n1,759,587 \n24.0 \n%\n(11)\n%\n(16)\n%\nKetjen\n1,036,422 \n19.3 \n%\n1,055,780 \n11.0 \n%\n899,572 \n12.3 \n%\n(2)\n%\n17 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n5,377,526 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n9,617,203 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n7,320,104 \n100.0 \n%\n(44)\n%\n31 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nEnergy Storage\n$\n757,540 \n66.5 \n%\n$\n3,181,593 \n89.7 \n%\n$\n3,352,356 \n88.3 \n%\n(76)\n%\n(5)\n%\nSpecialties\n228,504 \n20.0 \n%\n298,506 \n8.4 \n%\n527,318 \n13.9 \n%\n(23)\n%\n(43)\n%\nKetjen\n131,066 \n11.5 \n%\n103,872 \n2.9 \n%\n28,732 \n0.7 \n%\n26 \n%\n262 \n%\nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA\n1,117,110 \n98.0 \n%\n3,583,971 \n101.0 \n%\n$\n3,908,406 \n102.9 \n%\n(69)\n%\n(8)\n%\nCorporate\n22,668 \n2.0 \n%\n(37,983)\n(1.0)\n%\n(110,958)\n(2.9)\n%\n(160)\n%\n(66)\n%\nTotal adjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,139,778 \n100 \n%\n$\n3,545,988 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n3,797,448 \n100.0 \n%\n(68)\n%\n(7)\n%\nSee below for a reconciliation of total segment adjusted EBITDA to consolidated Net (loss) income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (in thousands):\n65\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,117,110 \n$\n3,583,971 \n$\n3,908,406 \nCorporate expenses, net\n22,668 \n(37,983)\n(110,958)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(588,638)\n(429,944)\n(300,841)\nInterest and financing expenses\n(a)\n(165,619)\n(116,072)\n(122,973)\nIncome tax expense\n(87,085)\n(430,277)\n(390,588)\nProportionate share of Windfield income tax expense\n(b)\n(299,193)\n(779,703)\n(321,591)\nGain (loss) on change in interest in properties/sale of business, net\n(c)\n— \n71,190 \n(8,400)\nAcquisition and integration related costs\n(d)\n(6,223)\n(26,767)\n(16,259)\nRestructuring charges and asset write-offs\n(e)\n(1,180,806)\n(9,491)\n— \nGoodwill impairment\n(f)\n— \n(6,765)\n— \nNon-operating pension and OPEB items\n11,335 \n7,971 \n57,032 \n(Loss) gain in fair value of public equity securities\n(g)\n(70,758)\n(44,732)\n4,319 \nLegal accrual\n(h)\n— \n(218,510)\n— \nOther\n(i)\n67,760 \n10,588 \n(8,331)\nNet (loss) income attributable to Albemarle Corporation\n$\n(1,179,449)\n$\n1,573,476 \n$\n2,689,816 \n(a)\nIncluded in Interest and financing expenses is a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment.\n We assign the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates, which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method, with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves, which are depleted on a units-of-production method. We evaluate the recovery of our property, plant and equipment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that may trigger a test for recoverability include, but are not limited to, significant adverse changes to projected revenues, costs, or capital plans or changes to government regulations that may adversely impact our current or future operations. An impairment is determined to exist if the total projected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are not recoverable or are less than the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group. We estimate future cash flows based on numerous assumptions, which are consistent or reasonable in relation to internal budgets and projections, and actual future cash flows may be significantly different than the estimates. Significant estimates used include, but are not limited to, market pricing (including lithium index pricing), customer demand, operating and production costs, and the timing and capital costs of expansion and sustaining projects. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events.\nAcquisition Method of Accounting\n. We recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses. Determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash flows and discount rates, among other items. When acquiring mineral reserves, the fair value is estimated using an excess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the specific operation. Management’s cash flow projections involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected production of the mine over the estimated time period, sales prices, shipment volumes, and expected profit margins. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the preliminary fair value assigned to mineral reserves. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. For more information on our acquisitions and \n68\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\napplication of the acquisition method, see Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nIncome Taxes.\n We assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings, and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions.\nInventory Valuation.\n Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined using standard cost, which approximates the first-in, first-out basis. Cost is determined on the weighted-average basis for a small portion of our inventories at foreign plants and our stores, supplies and other inventory. A portion of our domestic produced finished goods and raw materials are determined on the last-in, first-out basis. If management estimates that the market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market pricing and demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is recorded in an inventory reserve with an expense recorded to Cost of goods sold. \nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities.\n We estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site-specific facts and circumstances. Cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing (i) the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter, (ii) the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and (iii) the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. \nCertain of our sites are subject to various laws and regulations, including legal and contractual obligations to reclaim, remediate, or otherwise restore properties at the time the property is removed from service. The fair value recorded is estimated based on cost information obtained both internally and externally. These estimates are inflated based the assumed timing of the obligation payments and discounted using on available risk-free discount rate at the time. We review our assumptions and estimates of these costs periodically or if we become aware of material changes to these obligations.\nActual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers. A performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer. The transaction price of a contract, or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations, is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments, if applicable, for any variable consideration, such as customer rebates, noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer, although these adjustments are generally not material. Where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, although these situations are rare and are generally not built into our contracts. Any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material. Standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers, which in some cases are based on established market prices. Sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue. Our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days, however, they vary by market factors, such as customer size, creditworthiness, geography and competitive environment.\nAll of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers, and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery. Significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements. Our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices, while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days. Costs for shipping and handling activities, whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods, are accounted for as fulfillment costs. Such costs are immaterial.\nThe Company currently utilizes the following practical expedients, as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n:\n•\nAll sales and other pass-through taxes are excluded from contract value;\n69\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n•\nIn utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, no adjustment was necessary for contracts that did not cross over the reporting year;\n•\nWe will not consider the possibility of a contract having a significant financing component (which would effectively attribute a portion of the sales price to interest income) unless, if at contract inception, the expected payment terms (from time of delivery or other relevant criterion) are more than one year;\n•\nIf our right to customer payment is directly related to the value of our completed performance, we recognize revenue consistent with the invoicing right; and\n•\nWe expense as incurred all costs of obtaining a contract incremental to any costs/compensation attributable to individual product sales/shipments for contracts where the amortization period for such costs would otherwise be one year or less.\nCosts incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less. When the Company incurs pre-production or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable, such costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, which is less than one year. We record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance, which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to not be amortized.\nWe test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management. In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company initially performs a qualitative test (“Step 0”), where it first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company performs a quantitative test (“Step 1”). During Step 1, the Company estimates the fair value using either a discounted cash flow model (income) approach or a combination of the discounted cash flow model (income) approach and earnings multiple (market) approach (placing equal weighting on the income and market approaches). The income approach determines fair value based on discounted cash flow model derived from a reporting unit’s long-term forecasted cash flows. The market approach determines fair value based on the application of earnings multiples of comparable companies to the projected earnings of the reporting unit. Future cash flows for all reporting units include assumptions about revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate as well as other economic or industry-related factors. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest and financing expenses, income tax expenses, the proportionate share of Windfield income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items on a segment basis. For the Refining Solutions reporting unit, within the Ketjen segment, the revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, EBITDA multiples, market participant acquisition premium and the discount rate were deemed to be significant assumptions. For the Energy Storage reporting unit, the revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins and the discount rate were deemed to be significant assumptions. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties, particularly regarding future market conditions and cost fluctuations. Any adverse changes in these assumptions, such as a decline in demand, increased competition, rising costs or the imposition of new tariffs could negatively impact the fair value of the reporting units, since they are forecasting future events. The Company uses a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing. The WACC calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective. The factors in this calculation are largely external to the Company and, therefore, are beyond its control. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis. The Company tests its recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts.\nIn July 2024, the Company made the decision to stop construction of Kemerton conversion plant Train 3 and put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. See Note 17, “Restructuring Charges and Asset Write-offs,” for further details. The Company determined these actions to be a triggering event for a review for impairment of its Energy Storage reporting unit \n70\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\ngoodwill. As a result, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company tested the goodwill of the Energy Storage reporting unit by comparing its estimated fair value, using a discounted cash flow model, to the related carrying value. Based on the analysis, the Energy Storage reporting unit had sufficient headroom, which is defined as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value, that reasonable differences in the significant assumptions used would not impact the conclusion. Consequently, the Company concluded that the Energy Storage estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, thus no impairment was recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2024. No evidence of impairment was noted for the reporting units with goodwill balances from the analysis. However, if the adjusted EBITDA or discount rate estimates for the Refining Solutions reporting unit negatively changed by 10% (absent any other changes), the Refining Solutions fair value would be below its carrying value. Potential events and changes in circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions include reductions in demand in oilfield markets, inability to implement effective pricing actions to offset cost increases, changes in macroeconomic conditions and the introduction or escalation of tariffs on imported materials. We will continue to monitor these factors closely and assess their impact on our goodwill impairment evaluations in future periods.\nWe assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trade names and trademarks, for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if we determine, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. During the year ended December 31, 2024, no evidence of impairment was noted from the analysis for our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents and customer lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twenty-five years. Except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our Lithium business, which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. We evaluate the recovery of our definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. See Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\nUnder authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and OPEB plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date. The primary assumptions are as follows:\n•\nDiscount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.\n•\nExpected Return on Plan Assets—We project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently.\n•\nRate of Compensation Increase—For salary-related plans, we project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement.\n•\nMortality Assumptions—Assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations.\nActuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of (loss) income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. The remaining components of pension and OPEB plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a monthly basis. The market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement.\nDuring 2024, we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets. We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions.\n71\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nOur U.S. defined benefit plans for non-represented employees are closed to new participants, with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen. In selecting the discount rates for the U.S. plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis. As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For 2024, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by Milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate. We believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2024 measurement date.\nIn selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we look at long-term yields on AA-rated corporate bonds when available. Our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates, particularly at the longer durations. For the Eurozone, we apply the Aon Hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate. For the U.K., the discount rate is determined by applying the Aon Hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of Albemarle’s U.K. plan. In other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of high-quality corporate bonds, we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration.\nAt December 31, 2024, the weighted-average discount rate for the U.S. and foreign pension plans increased to 5.65% and 4.04%, respectively, from 5.21% and 3.73%, respectively, at December 31, 2023 to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2024 measurement date. The discount rate for the OPEB plans at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 5.67% and 5.21%, respectively.\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocations of plan assets to these investments. For the years 2024 and 2023, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 6.88%, and the weighted-average expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 5.95% and 4.86%, respectively. Effective January 1, 2025, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. and foreign pension plan assets is 6.70% and 6.52%, respectively.\nIn projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of changes in inflation rates. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 3.65% and 3.67%, respectively, for our foreign pension plans.\nFor the purpose of measuring our U.S. pension and OPEB obligations at December 31, 2024 and 2023, we used the Pri-2012 Mortality Tables along with the MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale, respectively, published by the SOA.\nAt December 31, 2024, the assumed rate of increase in the pre-65 and post-65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was zero as the employer-paid premium caps (pre-65 and post-65) were met starting January 1, 2013.\nA variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued OPEB liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and OPEB cost. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions, primarily in the U.S. (in thousands):\n(Favorable) Unfavorable\n1% Increase\n1% Decrease\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin  Benefit Obligation\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Benefit Cost\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin  Benefit Obligation\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Benefit Cost\nActuarial Assumptions\nDiscount Rate:\nPension\n$\n(53,893)\n$\n2,604 \n$\n62,968 \n$\n(3,252)\nOther postretirement benefits\n$\n(2,756)\n$\n145 \n$\n3,195 \n$\n(179)\nExpected return on plan assets:\nPension\n* \n$\n(5,200)\n* \n$\n5,209 \n* Not applicable.\nOf the $539.7 million total pension and postretirement assets at December 31, 2024, $56.9 million, or approximately 11%, are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient. Gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets. See Note 13, “Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n72\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. In order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, we are following guidance under ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet, along with any related valuation allowance. Tax effects are released from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.\nDeferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character. Although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized. We elected to not consider the estimated impact of potential future Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax liabilities for purposes of assessing valuation allowances on its deferred tax balances.\nWe only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. Once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in Income tax expense on the consolidated statements of (loss) income.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to the statute of limitations, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for years prior to 2021. Due to the statute of limitations, we also are no longer subject to U.S. state income tax audits prior to 2018.\nWith respect to jurisdictions outside the U.S., several audits are in process. We have audits ongoing for the years 2014 through 2023 related to Belgium, Canada, Chile, China and Germany, some of which are for entities that have since been divested.\nWhile we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.\nSince the timing of resolutions and/or closure of tax audits are uncertain, it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months. As a result of the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business in 2016, we agreed to indemnify certain income and non-income tax liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, associated with the entities sold. The associated liability is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities. See Note 14, “Other Noncurrent Liabilities,” and Note 20, “Income Taxes,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details.\nWe have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries. Our foreign earnings are computed under U.S. federal tax earnings and profits (“E&P”) principles. In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&P amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided, as they are essentially permanent in duration. The determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. We provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested. We will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nOverview\nThe principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs, funding working capital, and service of debt. We also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, pay dividends to \n73\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nour shareholders and have the ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations, debt financing and equity issuances.\nWe are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, payables and inventory. We anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures and other investing activities, fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flow\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2024 as compared to $889.9 million at December 31, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities was $702.1 million, $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 versus 2023 was primarily due to decreased earnings from the Energy Storage and Specialties segments, driven by lower lithium market prices, and $1.7 billion less dividends received from unconsolidated investments, partially offset by positive working capital changes year-over-year of $2.3 billion. The inflow from working capital in 2024 was primarily driven by working capital management and the impact of lower lithium pricing in inventories and accounts receivables. This was partially offset by lower accounts payable driven by similar lower lithium pricing. Working capital outflows in 2023 were driven by higher inventory balances from higher cost spodumene and accounts receivable balances from higher net sales. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2023 versus 2022 was primarily due to lower earnings from the Energy Storage and Specialties segments, partially offset by lower working capital outflows and higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments, primarily from the Windfield joint venture. Working capital outflows in both 2023 and 2022 were driven by higher inventory balances from higher cost spodumene and accounts receivable balances from higher net sales each year.\nDuring 2024, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and net proceeds from the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock of $2.2 billion funded $1.7 billion of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, the repayment of a net balance of $620.0 million of commercial paper, dividends to common shareholders of $188.5 million and dividends to mandatory convertible preferred shareholders of $122.7 million. During 2023, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and net proceeds from net borrowings of commercial paper and long-term debt of $944.2 million funded $2.1 billion of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, net; approximately $380 million paid to MRL for the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture; $218.5 million to resolve the legal matter with the DOJ and SEC; investments in marketable securities, primarily public equity securities, of $204.5 million; and dividends to shareholders of $187.2 million. During 2022, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and the proceeds of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and credit agreements funded $1.3 billion of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, the repayment of long-term debt and credit agreements of $705.0 million, the net repayment of $391.7 million of commercial paper, the final payment of $332.5 million of a settlement of an arbitration ruling for a prior legal matter and dividends to shareholders of $184.4 million. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our consolidated joint venture, JBC, declared dividends of $149.8 million, $149.7 million and $274.5 million, respectively, which resulted in dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $37.2 million, $105.6 million and $44.2 million ($53.1 million declared in 2022 was paid in the first quarter of 2023), respectively.\nIn January 2024, the Company sold equity securities of a public company for proceeds of approximately $81.5 million. As a result of the sale, the Company realized a loss of $33.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOn March 8, 2024, the Company issued 46,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The 2,300,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued had a $1,000 per share liquidation preference. As a result of this transaction, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion, net of underwriting fees and offering costs. The proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. See Note 16, “Equity,” for additional information.\nOn October 18, 2023, the Company closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with MRL. This updated structure is intended to significantly simplify the commercial operation agreements previously entered into, allow us to retain full control of downstream conversion assets and to provide greater strategic opportunities for each company based on their global operations and the evolving lithium market.\nUnder the amended agreements, Albemarle acquired the remaining 40% ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia that was jointly owned with Mineral Resources through the MARBL joint venture. Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own 50% of Wodgina, and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Albemarle paid MRL approximately $380 million in cash, which includes \n74\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n$180 million of consideration for the remaining ownership of Kemerton as well as a payment for the economic effective date of the transaction being retroactive to April 1, 2022.\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Qinzhou, for approximately $200 million in cash. Qinzhou's operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tonnes of LCE and is capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide.\nOn May 13, 2022, the Company issued a series of notes (collectively, the “2022 Notes”) as follows:\n•\n$650.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 4.65% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 4.84%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2027.\n•\n$600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.05% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.18%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2032.\n•\n$450.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.65% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.71%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2052.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes were used to repay the balance of commercial paper notes, the remaining balance of $425.0 million of the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and for general corporate purposes. The 2024 Notes were originally due to mature on December 15, 2024 and bore interest at a rate of 4.15%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.2 million in Interest and financing expenses, representing the tender premiums, fees, unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of the 2024 Notes. In addition, the loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the accelerated amortization of the interest rate swap associated with the 2024 Notes from Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nCapital expenditures were $1.7 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were incurred mainly for plant, machinery and equipment. Capital\n \nexpenditures in 2024 include spending for construction of Kemerton Trains 3 and 4 and certain other capital projects, which were stopped as part of our announced comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, capital expenditures for the construction of Kemerton Trains 3 and 4 were $296.2 million, $535.7 million and $44.0 million, respectively.\nIn addition, in stopping construction of Kemerton Trains 3 and 4, and putting Kemerton Train 2 on care and maintenance, we incurred $62.3 million of related contract cancellation costs and required charges under take or pay contracts, as well as  of severance and employee benefit charges. The Company’s actions regarding Kemerton are part of a broader effort focused on preserving its world-class resource advantages, optimizing its global conversion network, improving our cost competitiveness and efficiency, reducing capital intensity and enhancing the Company’s financial flexibility. As part of this effort, effective November 1, 2024, the Company transitioned its operating structure to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) from a global business unit model. In connection with all restructuring actions noted, we recorded severance and employee benefit charges of $70.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect to record additional restructuring costs in the range of $35 million to $45 million associated with these actions in the year ended December 31, 2025.\nWe expect our capital expenditures to be between $700 million and $800 million in 2025 reflecting the announced new level of spending to unlock cash flow over the near term and generate long-term financial flexibility. The forecasted lower capital expenditures in 2025 reflect reduced sustaining growth and capital spend, while continuing safety and critical maintenance expenditures.\nThe Company is permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15,000,000 shares under a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. There were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2024, 2023 or 2022. At December 31, 2024, there were 7,396,263 remaining shares available for repurchase under the Company’s authorized share repurchase program.\nNet current assets increased to approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024 from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the increased cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the $2.2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in March 2024, and the resulting paydown of commercial paper. In addition, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable balances all decreased from December 31, 2023 due to the lower \n75\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nlithium market prices and intentional working capital management. Additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates. The additional changes are not the result of any policy changes by the Company, and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash and cash equivalents included $833.7 million and $857.6 million, respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations. From time to time, we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends, but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repatriated approximately $32.7 million, $2.9 million and $1.7 million of cash, respectively, as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities.\nWhile we continue to closely monitor our cash generation, working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy, we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate that future capital spending, including business acquisitions and other cash outlays, should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations, cash on hand and additional issuances of debt or equity securities, as needed.\nLong-Term Debt\nWe currently have the following notes outstanding:\nIssue Month/Year\nPrincipal (in millions)\nInterest Rate\nInterest Payment Dates\nMaturity Date\nNovember 2019\n€377.1\n1.125%\nNovember 25\nNovember 25, 2025\nMay 2022\n(a)\n$650.0\n4.65%\nJune 1 and December 1\nJune 1, 2027\nNovember 2019\n€500.0\n1.625%\nNovember 25\nNovember 25, 2028\nNovember 2019\n(a)\n$171.6\n3.45%\nMay 15 and November 15\nNovember 15, 2029\nMay 2022\n(a)\n$600.0\n5.05%\nJune 1 and December 1\nJune 1, 2032\nNovember 2014\n(a)\n$350.0\n5.45%\nJune 1 and December 1\nDecember 1, 2044\nMay 2022\n(a)\n$450.0\n5.65%\nJune 1 and December 1\nJune 1, 2052\n(a)    Denotes senior notes.\nOur senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each series of notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of these notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using the comparable government rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 40 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of $40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default.\nOur Euro notes issued in 2019 are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all our other unsecured senior obligations. The Euro notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each series of notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal thereof and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to, but excluding, the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual \n76\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nbasis using the bond rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 35 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness exceeding $100 million caused by a nonpayment default.\nGiven current economic conditions, specifically around the market pricing of lithium, and the related impact on the Company’s future earnings, on October 31, 2024, we further amended the 2022 Credit Agreement, which provides for borrowings of up to $1.5 billion and matures on October 28, 2027. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.910% to 1.375%, depending on the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services LLC (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”). With respect to loans denominated in U.S. dollars, interest is calculated using the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a term SOFR adjustment of 0.10%, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin on the facility was 1.20% as of December 31, 2024. There were 0 borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\nBorrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent, including the absence of defaults. The October 2024 amendment was entered into to modify the financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement to avoid a potential covenant violation over the following 18 months given the current market pricing of lithium. The amended 2022 Credit Agreement subjects the Company to two financial covenants, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The amended first financial covenant requires that the ratio of (a) (i) the Company’s consolidated net funded debt plus a proportionate amount of Windfield’s net funded debt less (ii) the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus a proportionate amount of Windfield’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (up to a specified amount) to (b) consolidated Windfield-Adjusted EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be less than or equal to (i) 4.00:1.0 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, (ii) 4.75:1.0 as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, (iii) 5.75:1.0 as of the end of the second quarter of 2025, (iv) 5.50:1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2025, (v) 5.00:1.0 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, (vi) 4.75:1.0 as of the end of each of the first and second quarters of 2026, and (vii) 3.50:1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2026 and each fiscal quarter thereafter through the third quarter of 2027. The maximum permitted leverage ratios described above are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement upon the consummation of an acquisition after June 30, 2026 if the consideration includes cash proceeds from the issuance of funded debt in excess of $500 million. \nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the amended second financial covenant requires that the ratio of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be no less than (i) 1.00:1.0 for fiscal quarters through June 30, 2025, (ii) 2.00:1.0 for the third quarter of 2025, (iii) 2.50:1.0 for the fourth quarter of 2025, and (iv) 3.00:1.0 for all fiscal quarters thereafter. The 2022 Credit Agreement also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2022 Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the commitments under the 2022 Credit Agreement being terminated. Following the $2.2 billion issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in March 2024 and the amendments to the financial covenants, the Company expects to maintain compliance with the amended financial covenants in the near future. However, a significant downturn in lithium market prices or demand could impact the Company’s ability to maintain compliance with its amended financial covenants and it could require the Company to seek additional amendments to the 2022 Credit Agreement and/or issue debt or equity securities to fund its activities and maintain financial flexibility. If the Company were unable to obtain such necessary additional amendments, this could lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the Company to repay its outstanding debt. In that situation, the Company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders.\nOn May 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “Commercial Paper Notes”) from time-to-time. On May 17, 2023, we entered into definitive documentation to increase the size of our existing commercial paper program. The maximum aggregate face amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at any time is $1.5 billion. The proceeds from the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. The 2022 Credit Agreement is available to repay the Commercial Paper Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement and the Commercial Paper Notes will not exceed the $1.5 billion current maximum amount available under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The Commercial Paper Notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The \n77\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\ndefinitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations, warranties, default and indemnification provisions. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repaid a net amount of $620.0 million of commercial paper notes using the net proceeds received from the issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Company received a loan of $300.0 million to be repaid in five equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2026. This interest-free loan was discounted using an imputed interest rate of 5.5% and the Company will amortize that discount through Interest and financing expenses over the term of the loan.\nWhen constructing new facilities or making major enhancements to existing facilities, we may have the opportunity to enter into incentive agreements with local government agencies in order to reduce certain state and local tax expenditures. Under these agreements, we transfer the related assets to various local government entities and receive bonds. We immediately lease the facilities from the local government entities and have an option to repurchase the facilities for a nominal amount upon tendering the bonds to the local government entities at various predetermined dates. The bonds and the associated obligations for the leases of the facilities offset, and the underlying assets are recorded in property, plant and equipment. We currently have the ability to transfer up to $540 million in assets under these arrangements. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were $74.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively, of bonds outstanding under these arrangements.\nThe non-current portion of our long-term debt amounted to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $3.54 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, at December 31, 2024, we had the ability to borrow $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program and the 2022 Credit Agreement, and $98.8 million under other existing lines of credit, subject to various financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement. We have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement, as applicable. Therefore, the amounts outstanding under those credit lines, if any, are classified as long-term debt. We believe that as of December 31, 2024 we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. For additional information about our long-term debt obligations, see Note 12, “Long-Term Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, including bank guarantees and letters of credit, which totaled approximately $115.7 million at December 31, 2024. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nLiquidity Outlook\nWe generally use cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities, divestitures and borrowings to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund any capital expenditures, make acquisitions, make pension contributions and pay dividends. We also could issue additional debt or equity securities to fund these activities in an effort to maintain our financial flexibility. Our main focus in the short-term, during the continued uncertainty surrounding the global economy, including lithium market pricing and recent inflationary trends, is to continue to maintain financial flexibility by continuing our cost savings initiative, while still protecting our employees and customers, committing to shareholder returns and maintaining an investment grade rating. Over the next three years, in terms of uses of cash, we will continue to invest in growth of the businesses and return value to shareholders. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets, which may require additional liquidity. Financing the purchase price of any such acquisitions could involve borrowing under existing or new credit facilities and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities, in addition to cash on hand. \nWe expect our capital expenditures to be between $700 million and $800 million in 2025, down from $1.7 billion in 2024. Lower capital expenditures in 2025 reflects the announced new level of spending to unlock cash flow over the near term and generate long-term financial flexibility and is driven by reduced sustaining growth and capital spend, while continuing safety and critical maintenance expenditures.\nThe Company’s actions regarding Kemerton are part of a broader effort focused on preserving its world-class resource advantages, optimizing its global conversion network, improving the Company’s cost competitiveness and efficiency, reducing capital intensity and enhancing the Company’s financial flexibility. As part of this effort, effective November 1, 2024, the Company transitioned its operating structure to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) from a global business unit model. We expect the comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure to drive additional cost and productivity improvements of $300 million to $400 million per year.\n78\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nIn the normal course of business, amounts received from customers in advance of the Company’s satisfaction of its contractual performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue, and are recognized within Net sales as the Company satisfies the related performance obligation. In January 2025, the Company received $350 million from certain customers for the delivery of specified amounts of spodumene and lithium salts over the next 5 years.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we are party to master receivables purchase agreements, under which we may sell up to approximately $92 million of available and eligible outstanding customer accounts receivable generated by sales to certain customers. The agreements are uncommitted and can be terminated by us or the purchaser with certain notice as defined in the contracts. Transactions under this agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, and the receivables sold are removed from the consolidated balance sheets at the time of the sales transaction. As of December 31, 2024, there were no accounts receivable sold under these master receivables purchase agreements.\nIn 2022, we announced we had been awarded a nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for EVs and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The grant funding is intended to support a portion of the anticipated cost to construct a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at our Kings Mountain, North Carolina, location. We expect the concentrator facility to create hundreds of construction and full-time jobs and to produce approximately 420,000 tons of spodumene concentrate annually. To further support the restart of the Kings Mountain mine, in 2023, we announced a $90 million critical materials award from the U.S. Department of Defense. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company received $12.4 million of these funds.\nOverall, with generally strong cash-generative businesses and various capital resources, we believe we have, and will be able to maintain a solid liquidity position. In order to maintain financial flexibility, we may issue additional debt or equity securities to fund future debt maturities, capital spending and other cash outlays. Our annual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2024 are as follows (in millions): 2025—$398.5; 2026—$60.0; 2027—$710.0; 2028—$581.5; 2029—$231.6; thereafter—$1,623.1. In addition, we expect to make interest payments on those long-term debt obligations as follows (in millions): 2025—$124.3; 2026—$120.0; 2027—$102.4; 2028—$89.1; 2029—$80.2; thereafter—$927.7. For variable-rate debt obligations, projected interest payments are calculated using the December 31, 2024 weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.33%.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have committed to approximately $240.2 million of payments to third-party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes, with approximately $128.4 million to be paid in 2025. In order to secure materials, sometimes for long durations, these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe.\nSee Note 18, “Leases,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for our annual expected payments under our operating lease obligations at December 31, 2024.\nIn 2025, we expect to pay $82.7 million of the $127.3 million balance remaining from the transition tax on foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) signed into law in December 2017. The one-time transition tax imposed by the TCJA is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and is payable over an eight-year period, with the final payment to be made in 2026.\nContributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans, including our supplemental executive retirement plan, are expected to approximate $17 million in 2025. We may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount. We made contributions of approximately $17.4 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans (both qualified and nonqualified) during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe liability related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities totaled $259.6 million and $220.6 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in Other assets totaled $74.8 million and $73.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time.\nOur cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions, continuing inflationary trends and reduced capital availability. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of certain raw materials and in transportation and energy costs as a result of global market and supply chain disruptions and the broader inflationary \n79\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nenvironment. As a result, we are planning for various economic scenarios and actively monitoring our balance sheet to maintain the financial flexibility needed.\nAlthough we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions as sources of financing, an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments to us, decline funding under our existing but uncommitted lines of credit with them, not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing to us. While the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong, periods of elevated uncertainty related to the stability of the banking system, future pandemics or global economic and/or geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time. If such concerns heighten, we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature. If the U.S. Federal Reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to continue tightening the monetary supply, we may incur increased borrowing costs (as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities, as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations), although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $833.7 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. This cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access. The cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the U.S. We anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the U.S. in excess of our cash held in the U.S. can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing U.S. credit facilities or our commercial paper program.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nAlbemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd Issued Notes\nAlbemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd (the “Issuer”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “3.45% Senior Notes”) in November 2019. The 3.45% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Guarantee”) on a senior unsecured basis by Albemarle Corporation (the “Parent Guarantor”). No direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor guarantee the 3.45% Senior Notes (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Non-Guarantors”).\nIn 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 60% interest in Wodgina in Western Australia and formed an unincorporated joint venture with MRL, named MARBL Lithium Joint Venture, for the exploration, development, mining, processing and production of lithium and other minerals (other than iron ore and tantalum) from the Wodgina spodumene mine and for the operation of the Kemerton assets in Western Australia. We participate in Wodgina through our ownership interest in the Issuer. On October 18, 2023 we amended the joint venture agreements, resulting in a decrease of our ownership interest in the MARBL joint venture and Wodgina to 50%.\nPrior to January 1, 2024, the Parent Guarantor conducted its U.S. Specialties and Ketjen operations directly, and conducted its other operations (other than operations conducted through the Issuer) through the Non-Guarantors. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company split its U.S. Ketjen operations to a separate non-guarantor subsidiary and its results are no longer included within the summarized Parent Guarantor and Issuer financial information below for the 2024 periods presented.\nThe 3.45% Senior Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Issuer, effectively subordinated to all of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries. The Guarantee is the senior unsecured obligation of the Parent Guarantor and ranks equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, effectively subordinated to the secured debt of the Parent Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries.\nFor cash management purposes, the Parent Guarantor transfers cash among itself, the Issuer and the Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Issuer and/or the Parent Guarantor’s outstanding debt, common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend or loan.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor and (ii) equity \n80\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nin earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a Non-Guarantor. Each entity in the combined financial information follows the same accounting policies as described herein.\nSummarized Statement of Operations\nYear ended December 31,\n$ in thousands\n2024\nNet sales\n(a)\n$\n861,876 \nGross profit\n(66,144)\nLoss before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments\n(b)\n(593,433)\nNet loss attributable to the Guarantor and the Issuer\n(442,751)\n(a)    Includes net sales to Non-Guarantors of $460.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(b)    Includes intergroup expenses to Non-Guarantors of $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nSummarized Balance Sheet\nAt December 31,\n$ in thousands\n2024\nCurrent assets\n(a)\n$\n921,221 \nNet property, plant and equipment\n2,005,613 \nOther non-current assets\n(b)\n2,912,866 \nCurrent liabilities\n(c)\n$\n2,190,646 \nLong-term debt\n2,253,328 \nOther non-current liabilities\n(d)\n7,157,705 \n(a)    Includes receivables from Non-Guarantors of $411.2 million at December 31, 2024.\n(b)    Includes non-curent receivables from Non-Guarantors of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2024.\n(c)    Includes current payables to Non-Guarantors of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024.\n(d)    Includes non-current payables to Non-Guarantors of $6.8 billion at December 31, 2024.\nThe 3.45% Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Non-Guarantors. The Non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the 3.45% Senior Notes or the Indenture under which the 3.45% Senior Notes were issued, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that the Parent Guarantor has to receive any assets of any of the Non-Guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any Non-Guarantor, and the consequent rights of holders of the 3.45% Senior Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of a Non-Guarantor’s assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of such Non-Guarantor’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests, if any, of such Non-Guarantor. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Non-Guarantors, the Non-Guarantors will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests, if any, and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Parent Guarantor. \nThe 3.45% Senior Notes are obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer’s cash flow and ability to make payments on the 3.45% Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings it derives from the production from MARBL for Wodgina. Absent income received from sales of its share of production from MARBL, the Issuer’s ability to service the 3.45% Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries and other joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to the Issuer in the form of equity, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from the Issuer.\nThe Issuer’s obligations in respect of MARBL are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor. Further, under MARBL pursuant to a deed of cross security between the Issuer, the joint venture partner and the manager of the project (the “Manager”), each of the Issuer, and the joint venture partner have granted security to each other and the Manager for the obligations each of the Issuer and the joint venture partner have to each other and to the Manager. The claims of the joint venture partner, the Manager and other secured creditors of the Issuer will have priority as to the assets of the Issuer over the claims of holders of the 3.45% Senior Notes.\n81\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nAlbemarle Corporation Issued Notes\nIn March 2021, Albemarle New Holding GmbH (the “Subsidiary Guarantor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, added a full and unconditional guarantee (the “Upstream Guarantee”) to all securities of Albemarle Corporation (the “Parent Issuer”) issued and outstanding as of such date and, subject to the terms of the applicable amendment or supplement, securities issuable by the Parent Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”). No other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Issuer guarantee these securities (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Upstream Non-Guarantors”). See Long-term debt section above for a description of the securities issued by the Parent Issuer.\nThe current securities outstanding under the Indenture are the Parent Issuer’s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Parent Issuer.\n \nAll securities currently outstanding under the Indenture are effectively subordinated to the Parent Issuer’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. With respect to any series of securities issued under the Indenture that is subject to the Upstream Guarantee (which series of securities does not include the 2022 Notes), the Upstream Guarantee is, and will be, an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantor, ranking pari passu with all other existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor.\n \nAll securities currently outstanding under the Indenture (other than the 2022 Notes) are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent’s Subsidiaries other than the Subsidiary Guarantor.\n \nThe 2022 Notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent’s Subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Guarantor.\nFor cash management purposes, the Parent Issuer transfers cash among itself, the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Upstream Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Parent Issuer and/or the Subsidiary Guarantor’s outstanding debt, common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Parent Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantor to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend or loan.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Parent Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is an Upstream Non-Guarantor.\nSummarized Statement of Operations\nYear ended December 31,\n$ in thousands\n2024\nNet sales\n(a)\n$\n639,866 \nGross profit\n(12,059)\nLoss before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments\n(b)\n(400,246)\nNet loss attributable to the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Parent Issuer\n(353,248)\n(a)    Includes net sales to Non-Guarantors of $238.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(b)    Includes intergroup income from Non-Guarantors of $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nSummarized Balance Sheet\nAt December 31,\n$ in thousands\n2024\nCurrent assets\n(a)\n$\n1,104,082 \nNet property, plant and equipment\n800,913 \nOther non-current assets\n(b)\n2,188,306 \nCurrent liabilities\n(c)\n$\n2,559,256 \nLong-term debt\n2,551,714 \nOther non-current liabilities\n(d)\n6,303,456 \n82\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(a)    Includes current receivables from Non-Guarantors of $646.3 million at December 31, 2024.\n(b)    Includes noncurrent receivables from Non-Guarantors of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024.\n(c)    Includes current payables to Non-Guarantors of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024.\n(d)    Includes non-current payables to Non-Guarantors of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024.\nThese securities are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Upstream Non-Guarantors. The Upstream Non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to these securities or the Indenture under which these securities were issued, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that the Subsidiary Guarantor has to receive any assets of any of the Upstream Non-Guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any Upstream Non-Guarantors, and the consequent rights of holders of these securities to realize proceeds from the sale of any of an Upstream Non-Guarantor’s assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of such Upstream Non-Guarantor’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests, if any, of such Upstream Non-Guarantor. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Upstream Non-Guarantors, the Upstream Non-Guarantors will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests, if any, and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Subsidiary Guarantor.\nSafety and Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. To our knowledge, we are currently complying, and expect to continue to comply, in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. Compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not currently expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position, but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nAmong other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a PRP, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were $87.5 million, $73.0 million and $46.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures, and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years. Costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities, which at December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $20.0 million, a decrease of $14.1 million from $34.1 million at December 31, 2023. See Note 15, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nWe believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis, although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period.\nCapital expenditures for pollution-abatement and safety projects, including such costs that are included in other projects, were approximately $54.4 million, $116.7 million and $75.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the future, capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals. Management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution-abatement and safety regulations are subject to (a) the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and \n83\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(b) uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful, or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.",
