MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. However, none of the registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.\nDUKE ENERGY\nDuke Energy, an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, operates in the U.S. primarily through its subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and with Duke Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nExecutive Overview\nActing on Investment Opportunities. \nWe operate in some of the most attractive jurisdictions in the country and the affordable, reliable power we provide continues to play a key role in bringing business and job growth to our region. Our service territories continue to experience accelerating investment opportunities driven by a deepening economic development pipeline and significant customer growth. To efficiently fund this growth and the related capital required in the coming years, we entered into two strategic transactions in the third quarter of 2025. \nIn August 2025, we entered into an investment agreement to receive $6 billion in exchange for a 19.7% indirect investment in Duke Energy Florida. Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed through a series of closings starting in 2026 through mid-2028. In July 2025, we announced the sale of Piedmont’s Tennessee business to Spire Inc. for $2.48 billion. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect to complete the Piedmont transaction on March 31, 2026. Proceeds from both transactions will support Duke Energy’s expanded capital plan and replaces certain originally planned long-term debt and common equity issuances through 2029.\nBoth of these transactions, along with our unwavering focus on operational excellence and value creation, demonstrate our continued ability to meet the unprecedented long-term growth anticipated across our service territories. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Dispositions,\" for further information.\nBuilding a Smarter Energy Future. \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we continued to move our regulatory strategy forward and execute on investments for building a smarter energy future while maintaining our focus on safety and operational excellence, our customers, growth of our business as well as the engagement and empowerment of our employees. These priorities enable us to provide strong, sustainable value for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders.\n•\nIn January 2025, Piedmont and Duke Energy Indiana received constructive orders on their general rate cases from the NCUC and IURC, respectively. New rates were effective in November 2024 for Piedmont and late February 2025 for Duke Energy Indiana. New rates were also effective in January 2025 for Duke Energy Florida's new three-year rate plan. In June 2025, Duke Energy Progress filed a South Carolina base rate case and Duke Energy Kentucky filed a natural gas base rate case. In July 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a South Carolina base rate case. In October 2025, Duke Energy Kentucky received a constructive order on its electric base rate case filed last December and Duke Energy Progress reached a comprehensive settlement in its South Carolina base rate case. Our regulatory efforts continue to focus on securing critical investments for reliable customer service while ensuring timely cost recovery across our service territories.\n•\nIn October 2025, Duke Energy Progress received an order from the NCUC granting the CPCN for the second CC unit in Person County and Duke Energy Indiana received an order from the IURC granting the CPCN for the Cayuga CC project. Also in October 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas filed for a CECPCN with the PSCSC for a new CC unit in Anderson County, South Carolina. These advanced natural gas plants, along with our planned CTs, will provide critical generation as we continue to modernize our energy infrastructure in the coming years.\n•\nWe reached key milestones to recover costs related to critical storm restoration activities from the 2024 historic storm season while also seeking to minimize customer bill impacts resulting from hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton. In February 2025, the FPSC voted to approve Duke Energy Florida's storm cost recovery of approximately $1.1 billion over 12 months beginning in March 2025. During 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached constructive settlements in Phase 2 proceedings and\n financing orders have been issued by both the NCUC and PSCSC. In Septe\nmber 2025, we issued North Carolina storm recovery bonds and expect to securitize the related South Carolina storm costs by the end of 2025.\n•\nOur nuclear sites continue to positively impact the customers we serve by safely producing clean, reliable and low-cost electricity, as well as providing economic benefits for our local communities that includes thousands of well-paying jobs and significant tax benefits. During 2025, we continue to sell nuclear PTCs to further reduce the cost of electricity for our customers. Additionally, in March 2025, the NRC issued a subsequent license renewal for Oconee that allows an additional 20 years of operation through 2054. Oconee is the first Duke Energy nuclear facility to reach this significant approval milestone to permit extension of its operations to 80 years. In April 2025, we submitted an application to the NRC for Robinson to extend the plant's operations an additional 20 years through 2050.\n•\nIn July 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its final license application with the FERC to extend the operating license for the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Station. Located in South Carolina, Bad Creek is designed to produce significant amounts of energy when our customers need it most, performing a vital role on the company's system since 1991. If approved, the application would extend plant operations for an additional 50 years through 2077.\n103\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\n•\nIn August 2025, \nwe filed\n applications with the NCUC, PSCSC and FERC to combine our utilities that operate in the Carolinas, by which Duke Energy Progress will merge into Duke Energy Carolinas. This proposed transaction would result in a single electric utility serving our \nNorth Carolina and S\nouth Carolina service territories. The single utility’s ability to plan, execute and operate resources more efficiently is expected to result in substantial cost savings to benefit customers by reducing the overall costs to serve. The targeted effective date is January 1, 2027, subject to regulatory approvals.\nOperational Excellence. \nIn June 2025, as the summer's first heat wave brought triple-digit temperatures to parts of North Carolina and South Carolina, our customers set a new summertime record for electricity usage, surpassing the previous summertime record set in July 2024. We maintain our focus on operational excellence and prepare for extreme weather by identifying potential risks, effectively maintaining adequate short-term planning reserves, leveraging outage scheduling optimization and controlling planned and emergent equipment issues.\nEconomic Development.\n In June 2025, the governor of North Carolina announced Amazon is planning to invest an estimated $10 billion to launch a new high-tech cloud computing and artificial intelligence innovation campus in Richmond County, North Carolina. The site selected for this project was included in Duke Energy's Site Readiness Program in 2019, a program that helps state, regional and local economic development partners increase the competitiveness of potential industrial land. These new data centers will be located in Duke Energy Progress' service territory and the investment is expected to be among the largest in North Carolina's history, a testament to the impactful and ongoing work of continuing to bring economic development success to the vibrant communities we proudly serve.\nSee Notes 4 and 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Income Taxes,\" for additional information.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nThe matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments. \nRegulatory Matters\nCoal Ash Costs\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the 2024 CCR Rule. \nCost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. For more information, see \"Other Matters\" and Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nStorm Cost Recovery\nFrom August through October 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Appropriate storm cost recovery mechanisms are in place to track and recover incremental costs from such events. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude has resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs and may impact the near-term results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the impacted registrants. Regulatory filings have been made for recovery of storm costs across all jurisdictions and full recovery is expected by early 2026. For more information related to storm costs, regulatory asset deferrals and financing activities, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and Notes 4, 6 and 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and Variable Interest Entities.\"\nEPA Regulations of GHG Emissions\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued final rules under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants. Duke Energy is analyzing the potential impacts the rules could have on the Company, which could be material and may influence the timing, nature and magnitude of future generation investments in our service territories. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the final rules. In June 2025, the EPA proposed to repeal EPA Rule 111 as well as an alternative proposal for a narrower set of requirements. For more information, see \"Other Matters.\"\nSupply Chain\nThe Company continues to monitor the ongoing stability of markets for key materials and supplies, including potential restrictions on the trade of certain rare earth materials and technologies used in electric utility infrastructure. Public policy outcomes, including potential impacts from new or escalating tariffs or other actions from federal executive orders, federal legislation or other rulemakings, could disrupt or impact Duke Energy's supply chain, future financial results, capital plan execution or the ability to execute on the Company's vision for a smarter energy future.\nGoodwill\nThe Duke Energy Registrants performed their annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31, 2025. As of this date, all of the Duke Energy Registrants' reporting units' estimated fair values materially exceeded the carrying values except for the GU&I reporting unit of Duke Energy Ohio. While no goodwill impairment charges have been recorded in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, the potential for deteriorating economic conditions impacting GU&I's future cash flows or equity valuations of peer companies could impact the estimated fair value of GU&I, and goodwill impairment charges could be recorded in the future.\n104\nMD&A\nMATTERS IMPACTING FUTURE RESULTS\nMinority Interest in Florida Progress\nIn August 2025, Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Florida Progress entered into an investment agreement for Florida Progress to receive $6 billion in exchange for a 19.7% indirect investment in Duke Energy Florida. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions described in the investment agreement, including receipt of the approval of the FERC and completion of review by CFIUS, as well as approval, or a determination that the transaction does not require approval, by the NRC. The transaction is expected to be completed through a series of closings through June 30, 2028. Termination of the transaction under certain specified circumstances could require the investor to pay a $240 million termination fee to Progress Energy and result in Duke Energy seeking alternative funding sources through 2029, including additional long-term debt and common equity issuances. For additional information, see Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, “Dispositions.”\nSale of Piedmont's Tennessee Business\nIn July 2025, Piedmont entered into a purchase agreement to sell Piedmont’s Tennessee business. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval from the TPUC and expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR. The HSR waiting period for the transaction expired in September 2025. There is no assurance of the transaction as failure to obtain related approvals or to satisfy conditions in the purchase agreement could result in termination of the transaction. The purchase agreement contains termination rights and Spire Inc. may be required to pay a termination fee equal to 6.5% of the purchase price under certain circumstances that result in termination of the transaction. Termination of the purchase agreement could also result in Duke Energy seeking alternative funding sources for its 2025-2029 capital and investment expenditures plan, including additional long-term debt and common equity issuances. Completion of the transaction could impact the operating revenues and profitability of Piedmont, including potential recognition of a gain on sale. In the third quarter of 2025, Duke Energy and Piedmont reclassified the Piedmont Tennessee Disposal Group to assets held for sale. For additional information, see Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, “Dispositions.”\nOther\nDuke Energy continues to monitor general market conditions, including the potential for interest rate pressures on the Company's cost of capital, which may impact Duke Energy's capital plan execution, future financial results or the ability to execute on \nthe Company's\n vision for a smarter energy future.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP in the U.S., as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS, discussed below. Non-GAAP financial measures are numerical measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner. \nManagement evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. Adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders in dollar and basic per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings (Loss) and GAAP Reported Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share, respectively.\nSpecial items included in the periods presented below include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:\n•\nRegulatory Matters primarily represents impairment charges related to the 2024 Duke Energy Carolinas' South Carolina rate case order.\n•\nSystem Post-Implementation Costs represents the net impact of charges related to nonrecurring customer billing adjustments as a\nresult of implementation of a new customer system.\n•\nPreferred Redemption Costs represents charges related to the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock.\nDiscontinued operations primarily represents the operating results of Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025, as compared to September 30, 2024 \nGAAP reported EPS was $1.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to the drivers below, GAAP reported EPS increased primarily due to the net impact of charges related to nonrecurring customer billing adjustments in the prior year and charges related to the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock in the prior year.\nAs discussed above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy’s adjusted EPS was $1.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.62 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the implementation of new rates and riders, along with higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher interest expense, milder weather, and higher depreciation and property taxes on a growing asset base.\n105\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EPS, to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nEarnings\nEPS\n Earnings\nEPS\nGAAP Reported Earnings/GAAP Reported EPS\n$\n1,407\n \n$\n1.81\n \n$\n1,226 \n$\n1.60 \nAdjustments:\nSystem Post-Implementation Costs\n(a)\n—\n \n—\n \n16 \n0.02 \nPreferred Redemption Costs\n(b)\n—\n \n—\n \n16 \n0.02 \nDiscontinued Operations\n(c)\n—\n \n—\n \n(22)\n(0.03)\nAdjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS\n$\n1,407\n \n$\n1.81\n \n$\n1,236 \n$\n1.62 \nNote: Total EPS may not foot due to rounding.\n(a)\nNet of $5 million tax benefit. $17 million recorded within Operating Revenues, $1 million recorded within Operations, maintenance and other and $3 million recorded within Other Income and expenses.\n(b)    Recorded within Preferred Redemption Costs.\n(c)    Recorded in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025, as compared to September 30, 2024 \nGAAP Reported EPS was $4.81 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $4.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to the drivers below, GAAP reported EPS increased primarily due to impairments related to the 2024 South Carolina rate case in the prior year, the net impact of charges related to nonrecurring customer billing adjustments in the prior year and charges related to the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock in the prior year.\nAs discussed above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy’s adjusted EPS was $4.81 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $4.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the implementation of new rates and riders, along with higher retail sales volumes, partially offset by higher interest expense, operation and maintenance expense, and depreciation and property taxes on a growing asset base.\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EPS, to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nEarnings\nEPS\nEarnings\nEPS\nGAAP Reported Earnings/GAAP Reported EPS\n$\n3,743\n \n$\n4.81\n \n$\n3,211 \n$\n4.17 \nAdjustments:\nRegulatory Matters\n(a)\n—\n \n—\n \n25 \n0.03 \nSystem Post-Implementation Costs\n(b)\n—\n \n—\n \n16 \n0.02 \nPreferred Redemption Costs\n(c)\n—\n \n—\n \n16 \n0.02 \nDiscontinued Operations\n(d)\n1\n \n—\n \n(9)\n(0.01)\nAdjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS\n$\n3,744\n \n$\n4.81\n \n$\n3,259 \n$\n4.24 \nNote: Total EPS may not foot due to rounding.\n(a)\nNet of $8 million tax benefit. $42 million recorded within Impairment of assets and other charges, $2 million within Operations,\nmaintenance and other, and an $11 million reduction recorded within Interest Expense.\n(b)\nNet of $5 million tax benefit. $17 million recorded within Operating Revenues, $1 million recorded within Operations, maintenance and other and $3 million recorded within Other Income and expenses.\n(c)     Recorded within Preferred Redemption Costs.\n(d)    Recorded in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: EU&I and GU&I. The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other.

The ETRs for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, were 13.4% and 14.8%, respectively.

Duke Energy’s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. In 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida began monetizing tax credits in the transferability markets established by the IRA and are working with the state utility commissions on the appropriate regulatory process to pass the net realizable value back to customers over time. See Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, “Income Taxes,” for further information\n. \nDuke Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, included a summary and detailed discussion of projected primary sources and uses of cash for 2025 to 2027. \nIn 2025, Duke Energy executed several equity forward sales agreements as part of the ATM program. Settlement of the forward sales agreements is expected to occur by December 31, 2026. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, “Stockholders’ Equity” for further details. \nIn March 2025, Duke Energy extended the termination date of its existing Master Credit Facility to March 2030 and increased its capacity from $9 billion to $10 billion. \nAs of September 30, 2025, Duke Energy had \n$688 million of cash on hand and $7.5 billion available under its Master Cr\nedit Facility.\n Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs.\nSee Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Dispositions,\" for the timing and use of final proceeds received in April 2025 from the sale of certain Commercial Renewables assets to affiliates of Brookfield.\nIn July, Piedmont entered into an agreement with Spire Inc., to sell Piedmont’s Tennessee business for $2.48 billion. Piedmont expects to complete the sale on March 31, 2026, and proceeds are expected to be used for debt reduction at Piedmont and to efficiently fund Duke Energy's capital plan, primarily by displacing the issuance of common equity in the near term. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Dispositions,\" for further details.\nIn August 2025, Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Florida Progress entered into an investment agreement for Florida Progress to receive $6 billion in exchange for a 19.7% indirect investment in Duke Energy Florida. The transaction is expected to be completed through a series of closings through June 30, 2028. Proceeds from the minority interest investment are expected to be used to efficiently fund Duke Energy’s growing capital and investment expenditures plan, primarily by displacing certain previously planned issuances of long-term debt and common equity through 2029. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Dispositions,\" for information on the timing and use of proceeds related to the transaction.\nDebt\nAs discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" Duke Energy Carolinas terminated and repaid DERF in January 2025 and Duke Energy Progress terminated and repaid DEPR in March 2025. As a result of these repayments, DERF and DEPR have ceased operations. \n118\nMD&A\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFrom August through October 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. As discussed in Note 4, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude have resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs. See \"Matters Impacting Future Results\" for further details and Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for information regarding term loans executed in response to these major storm events and storm recovery bonds issued in September 2025. \nAdditionally, see Note \n6\n for information related to the Duke Energy (Parent) and Piedmont term loans executed in the third quarter of 2025.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes Duke Energy’s cash flows.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nCash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n8,672\n \n$\n8,951 \nInvesting activities\n(9,976)\n(9,851)\nFinancing activities\n1,622\n \n990 \nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n318\n \n90 \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n421\n \n357 \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n$\n739\n \n$\n447 \nOPERATING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s operating cash flows.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nVariance\nNet income\n$\n3,865\n \n$\n3,387 \n$\n478 \nNon-cash adjustments to net income\n6,380\n \n4,971 \n1,409 \nContributions to qualified pension plans\n—\n \n(100)\n100 \nPayments for asset retirement obligations\n(374)\n(417)\n43 \nWorking capital\n(1,595)\n720 \n(2,315)\nOther assets and Other liabilities\n396\n \n390 \n6 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n8,672\n \n$\n8,951 \n$\n(279)\nThe variance is primarily driven by:\n•\na $2,315 million decrease in net working capital amounts, primarily due to lower recovery of fuel costs and the timing of accruals and payments, including payments related to restoration activities from the 2024 storm season.\nPartially offset by:\n•\na $1,887 million increase in net income, after adjustment for non-cash items, primarily due to the\n implementation of new rates and riders including Duke Energy Florida's storm recovery surcharge, along with higher retail sales volumes, partially offset by higher interest expense, operation and maintenance expense and property taxes; and\n•\na $100 million increase due to contributions to qualified pension plans in the prior year.\n119\nMD&A\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nINVESTING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s investing cash flows.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nVariance\nCapital, investment and acquisition expenditures\n$\n(9,881)\n$\n(9,199)\n$\n(682)\nProceeds from the sales of Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups and other assets\n559\n \n— \n559 \nOther investing items\n(654)\n(652)\n(2)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(9,976)\n$\n(9,851)\n$\n(125)\nThe variance is primarily due to higher capital expenditures within the EU&I segment in the current year, partially offset by proceeds received from the sales of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.\nFINANCING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s financing cash flows.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nVariance\nIssuances of long-term debt, net\n$\n4,806\n \n$\n4,927 \n$\n(121)\nIssuances of common stock\n16\n \n26 \n(10)\nRedemption of preferred stock\n—\n \n(1,000)\n1,000 \nNotes payable, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings\n(824)\n(515)\n(309)\nDividends paid\n(2,455)\n(2,411)\n(44)\nContributions from noncontrolling interests\n—\n \n47 \n(47)\nOther financing items\n79\n \n(84)\n163 \nNet cash provided by financing activities\n$\n1,622\n \n$\n990 \n$\n632 \nThe variance is primarily due to:\n•\na $1 billion increase due to the redemption of Series B preferred stock in the prior year.\nPartially offset by:\n•\na $309 million decrease in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4, \"Regulatory Matters,\" in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for more information regarding potential plant retirements and Note 4, \"Regulatory Matters,\" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information regarding regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\nGHG Standards and Guidelines\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued final rules under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants, referred to as electric generating units. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to EPA Rule 111 as a member of Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition, a coalition of similarly affected utilities, and as a member of a utility trade group. The litigation is currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the Court). On February 5, 2025, the EPA requested the Court to withhold issuing an opinion and place the case in a 60-day abeyance to allow time for new EPA leadership to review the issues and EPA Rule 111 to determine how they wish to proceed. On February 19, 2025, the Court granted the EPA’s request. On April 21, 2025, the EPA filed a motion with the Court requesting a continuing abeyance while it conducts a new notice-and-comment rulemaking to reconsider the challenged EPA Rule 111. As part of this request, the EPA indicated it intended to issue a final rule by December 2025. On April 25, 2025, the Court granted the EPA’s motion and ordered that the litigation continue to remain in abeyance pending further order of the Court. On June 17, 2025, the EPA published a proposed rule to repeal EPA Rule 111 based on a finding that fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution” under the meaning of section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA also published an alternative proposal to repeal a narrower set of requirements leaving in place only GHG emission standards for new and reconstructed stationary combustion turbine electric generating units. Comments on the proposed rule were due by August 7, 2025.\n120\nMD&A\nOTHER MATTERS\nCoal Combustion Residuals\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments). Duke Energy, as part of a group of similarly affected electric utilities, filed a petition to challenge the 2024 CCR Rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the Court) on August 6, 2024. On February 13, 2025, the EPA requested the Court to withhold issuing an opinion and place the case in a 120-day abeyance to allow time for new EPA leadership to review the issues and the 2024 CCR Rule to determine how they wish to proceed. On that same day, the Court granted EPA’s motion to hold the case in abeyance pending further order of the Court. On June 13, 2025, the EPA requested, and the Court granted, a 60-day extension of the abeyance to give the agency time to “decide the full scope of reconsideration.” On August 11, 2025, the EPA filed a motion to govern further proceedings in the legacy CCR surface impoundments rule litigation, and on August 13, 2025, the Court granted an abeyance in the case until December 15, 2025.\nCost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations.\nSouth Carolina Energy Security Act\nAct 41, also referred to as the South Carolina Energy Security Act, was signed into law on May 12, 2025. \nThe law promotes evaluating new generation resources, including hydro pumped storage, hydrogen-capable natural gas, and advanced nu\nclear, while streamlining siting, permitting and construction of certain new resources located in South Carolina. Act 41 establishes a new process for evaluating new potential generation projects over 75 MW located in North Carolina that are planned to serve South Carolina retail customers. This legislation also establishes an electric rate stabilization mechanism for electric utilities to elect into a framework that provides for annual adjustments to base rates, including for CWIP\n and other cost categories. Electric utilities electing the mechanism must file a general rate case at least every five years.\nNorth Carolina Power Bill Reduction Act\nIn 2021, the state of North Carolina passed HB951, which among other things, directed the NCUC to develop and approve a carbon reduction plan that would target a 70% reduction in CO\n2\n emissions from Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Carolinas' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technolog\ny, while balancing affordability and reliability for customers. On July 29, 2025, North Carolina Senate Bill 266, or the Power Bill Reduction Act (SB266), was passed into law which retained HB951's 2050 carbon neutrality goal but eliminated the state's interim 2030 carbon reduction target and implemented other actions designed to reduce electricity costs for customers including enhanced cost recovery mechanisms for baseload generation by establishing an annual CWIP recovery for baseload generation and a construction project monitoring process. SB266 also provides more timely recovery of fuel costs, allows for the recovery of CTs in MYRP proceedings and authorizes the prudent continued use of securitization for certain costs and investments serving North Carolina retail electric customers, including increasing the eligible securitization amounts for sub-critical coal assets up to 100% of their respective net book value upon retirement.\nCarolinas Resource Plan\nOn October 1, 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their systemwide 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan (the 2025 Plan) with the NCUC, which builds upon the approved 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan, outlines development and procurement activities related to a diverse set of generation assets and presents an updated execution strategy to meet growing energy demands reliably and cost-effectively in the coming decades. A hearing is anticipated in the second quarter of 2026, and an order from the NCUC is expected to be issued by December 31, 2026\n. The 2025 Plan is expected to be filed with the PSCSC in November 2025."
