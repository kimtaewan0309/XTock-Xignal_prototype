Founded in 1969, we serve our clients as a full-service real estate capital provider. As of September 30, 2025, we have a portfolio of over 15,500 properties in all 50 states of the United States (\"U.S.\"), the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), and seven other countries in Europe. We are known as “The Monthly Dividend Company\n®\n” and have a mission to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. Since our founding, we have declared 664 consecutive monthly dividends and are a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats\n®\n index for having increased our dividend for over 30 consecutive years. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we owned or held interests in 15,542 properties, with approximately\n \n349.2 million\n \nsquare feet of leasable space leased to 1,647 clients doing business in 92 separate industries. Of the 15,542\n \nproperties in \n-33-\nTable\n of Contents\nour portfolio as of September 30, 2025, 15,205, or 97.8%, were single-client properties, and the remaining were multi–client properties. Our total portfolio of 15,542\n \nproperties as of September 30, 2025 had a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the client) of approximately 8.9 years. Total portfolio annualized base rent (defined as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables) on our leases as of September 30, 2025 was $5.22 billion.\nAs of September 30, 2025, approximately 31.5% of our total portfolio annualized base rent comes from properties leased to our investment grade clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies. As of September 30, 2025, our top 20 clients (based on percentage of total portfolio annualized base rent) represented approximately 36.2% of our annualized base rent and 10 of these clients have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies. Approximately 91% of our annualized retail base rent as of September 30, 2025, is derived from our clients with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business.\nUnless otherwise specified, references to rental revenue in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are exclusive of reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses totaling $82.5 million and $74.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $257.3 million and $227.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIncreases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders\nWe have continued our 56-year history of paying monthly dividends by increasing the dividend five times during 2025. As of October 2025, we have paid 112 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 132 times since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) in 1994.\n2025 Dividend increases\nMonth Declared\nMonth Paid\nMonthly Dividend per share\nIncrease per share\n1st increase\nDec 2024\nJan 2025\n$\n0.2640 \n$\n0.0005 \n2nd increase\nFeb 2025\nMar 2025\n$\n0.2680 \n$\n0.0040 \n3rd increase\nMar 2025\nApr 2025\n$\n0.2685 \n$\n0.0005 \n4th increase\nJun 2025\nJul 2025\n$\n0.2690 \n$\n0.0005 \n5th increase\nSep 2025\nOct 2025\n$\n0.2695 \n$\n0.0005 \nThe dividends paid per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 totaled $2.4085, as compared to $2.3350 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.074, or 3.1%.\nThe monthly dividend of $0.2695 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $3.234 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of 5.3% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $60.79 on September 30, 2025. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.\nInvestments\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we invested $1.4 billion at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.7%, including investments in 123 properties, properties under development or expansion, unconsolidated entities, and loans.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we invested $3.9 billion at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.5%, including investments in 252 properties, properties under development or expansion, unconsolidated entities, and loans. \nSee notes \n4\n, \nInvestments in Real Estate,\n \n5,\n \nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities, \nand \n6, Investments in Loans and Financing Receivables, \nto the consolidated financial statements for further details. \nDispositions \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we sold 140 properties with total net proceeds received of $214.8 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we sold 268 properties with total net proceeds received of $424.2 million. \n-34-\nTable\n of Contents\nEquity Capital Raising\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we raised $322.7 million of proceeds from the sale of common stock at a weighted average price of $57.54 per share, primarily through the settlement of 5.6 million shares of common stock under our ATM program. As of November 3, 2025, we had outstanding forward sale agreements under our ATM program for a total of 17.7 million shares of common stock, representing expected net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion (assuming full physical settlement of such agreements), of which 2.6 million shares were sold in October 2025. \nCredit Facilities\nIn April 2025, we closed on the recast and expansion of our multi-currency unsecured credit facilities totaling $5.38 billion, including a $1.38 billion unsecured facility for the Fund. See note 7\n,\n \nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\n, to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nNote Issuances\nIn October 2025, we issued $400.0 million of 3.950% senior unsecured notes due February 2029 (the \"2029 notes\") and $400.0 million of 4.500% senior unsecured notes due February 2033 (the \"2033 notes\").\nIn June 2025, we issued\n \n€650.0 of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due June 2031 (the “2031 notes”), and €650.0 of 3.875% senior unsecured notes due June 2035 (the “2035 notes”). \nIn April 2025, we issued $600.0 million of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due April 2035. \nSee note \n10\n,\n \nNotes Payable\n, and note \n21, Subsequent Events\n, \nto the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nPortfolio Discussion\nLeasing Results\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had 204 properties available for lease or sale out of 15,542 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.7% occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio. Our property-level occupancy rate excludes properties with ancillary leases only, such as cell towers and billboards, and properties with possession pending, and includes properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. Below is a summary of our portfolio activity for the periods indicated below:\nThree months ended September 30, 2025\nProperties available for lease as of June 30, 2025\n212 \nLease expirations \n(1) \n340 \nRe-leases to same client\n(225)\nRe-leases to new client\n(17)\nVacant dispositions\n(106)\nProperties available for lease as of September 30, 2025\n204 \nNine months ended September 30, 2025\nProperties available for lease as of December 31, 2024\n205 \nLease expirations \n(1)\n939 \nRe-leases to same client\n(678)\nRe-leases to new client\n(43)\nVacant dispositions\n(219)\nProperties available for lease as of September 30, 2025\n204 \n(1)\nIncludes scheduled and unscheduled expirations (including leases rejected in bankruptcy), as well as future expirations resolved in the periods indicated above.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, the new annualized base rent on re-leased units was $70.65 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of $68.29 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 103.5% on the re-leased units. \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the new annualized base rent on re-leased units was $213.70 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of $206.40 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 103.5% on the re-leased units. \n-35-\nTable\n of Contents\nAs part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions to unrelated, third-party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard, and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients. We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations.\nImpact of \nInflation\nLeases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, retail price index in the case of certain leases in the U.K. (typically subject to ceilings), or increases in clients’ sales volumes. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs. \nMoreover, our strategic focus on the use of net lease agreements reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses. Even though the utilization of net leases reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients' ability to pay rent. Additionally, inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, make it difficult to refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the properties we can acquire if the cost of financing an acquisition is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such property, thereby limiting the properties that can be acquired.\nImpact of Real Estate and Capital Markets\nIn the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the global capital markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and global capital markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.\nImpact of Current Macroeconomic Conditions\nWe monitor developments related to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse impact on our business and our clients. Our clients face challenges that may differ from or be additional to challenges we face, including potential changes in consumer confidence levels, behavior and spending and increased operational expenses, including potential impacts from changes in global trade policies. The extent of the future effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth strategies is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $3.5 billion of liquidity, which consists of cash and cash equivalents of $417.2 million, $864.2 million of expected net proceeds from the settlement of outstanding forward sale agreements under our ATM program (assuming full physical settlement of such agreements), and $2.2 billion of availability under our $4.0 billion credit facilities (excluding availability under our $1.38 billion fund credit facility), net of $1.3 billion of borrowing on the credit facilities and after deducting $469.4 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs. We use our revolving credit facilities as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under our commercial paper programs.\nOur primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Material Cash Requirements” table, which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through a combination of the following:\n•\nCash and cash equivalents;\n•\nFuture cash flows from operations;\n•\nIssuances of common stock or debt, or other securities offerings;\n•\nAdditional borrowings under our credit facilities or commercial paper programs, which are backstopped by our credit facilities; \n•\nShort-term loans;\n•\nAsset dispositions; and\n•\nCredit investment repayments.\nIn addition to these sources of liquidity, we recently launched a perpetual life fund, raising $716.0 million of equity commitments from institutional investors. We expect that this initiative will provide additional capital to support our growth objectives and enhance our liquidity position.\n-36-\nTable\n of Contents\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper programs.\nLong-Term Liquidity Requirements \nOur goal is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time. Historically, we have met our principal short-term and long-term capital needs, including the funding of high-quality real estate acquisitions, investments in loans to clients, property development, and capital expenditures by issuing common stock, long-term unsecured notes, and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of an offering to be accretively invested into additional properties or to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.\nCapitalization \nAs of September 30, 2025, our total capitalization was $85.4 billion. Total capitalization consisted of $56.1 billion of common equity (based on the September 30, 2025 closing price on the NYSE of $60.79 and assuming the conversion of 2.7 million common units of Realty Income, L.P.), and total outstanding borrowings of $29.3 billion on our credit facilities, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages payable, and senior unsecured notes and bonds and our proportionate share of unconsolidated entities' debt (excluding unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts, and premiums). \nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $2.0 billion in shares of our common stock, which will expire in January 2028. Repurchases under the repurchase program may be made at management’s discretion from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, Rule 10b5-1 plans or otherwise, all in accordance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. No share repurchases have been made to date under the repurchase program. \nATM Program\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we settled approximately 27.9 million shares of common stock previously sold pursuant to forward sale agreements through our ATM program for approximately $1.6 billion of net proceeds. As of September 30, 2025, we had outstanding forward-sale agreements under our ATM program for a total of 15.1 million shares of common stock, representing approximately $864.2 million in expected net proceeds, which have been executed at a weighted average price of $57.17 per share (assuming full physical settlement of all outstanding shares of common stock, subject to such forward sale agreements and certain assumptions made with respect to settlement dates). Additionally, as of September 30, 2025, we had 14.2 million shares remaining for future issuance under our ATM program. We anticipate maintaining the availability of our ATM program in the future, including the replenishment of authorized shares issuable thereunder. \nDebt Financing Activities \nAs of September 30, 2025, our total outstanding borrowings of credit facilities, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages payable, and senior unsecured notes and bonds were $28.7 billion, with a weighted average maturity of 5.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. As of September 30, 2025, approximately 93% of our total debt was fixed rate debt. See notes 7 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our outstanding debt, along with our debt financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 below. \nTerm Loan Redemptions\nIn August 2025, we repaid our $300.0 million unsecured term loan in full upon maturity, plus $0.3 million in accrued and unpaid interest. \nIn June 2025, we repaid our $500.0 million unsecured term loan in full upon maturity, plus $2.3 million in accrued and unpaid interest. \nMortgage Repayments\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we made $44.2 million in principal payments, including the full repayment of three mortgages for $42.9 million.\n-37-\nTable\n of Contents\nNote Issuances\nIn October 2025, we issued $400.0 million of 3.950% senior unsecured notes due February 2029 and $400.0 million of 4.500% senior unsecured notes due February 2033. \nIn June 2025, we issued €650.0 million of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due June 2031 and €650.0 million of 3.875% senior unsecured notes due June 2035.\nIn April 2025, we issued $600.0 million of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due April 2035.\nNote Repayments\nIn November 2025, we repaid $550.0 million of outstanding 4.625% senior unsecured notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon maturity. \nIn April 2025, we repaid $500.0 million of outstanding 3.875% senior unsecured notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon maturity. \nCredit Facilities\nIn April 2025, we entered into new $4.0 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities, to amend and restate our previous $4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our new revolving credit facilities consist of (a) a $2.0 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, consisting of two tranches, that will mature in April 2027 and (b) a $2.0 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, consisting of two tranches, that will mature in April 2029 (collectively, the “RI Credit Facilities”). The RI Credit Facilities also include two six-month extensions for each facility, which can be exercised at our option. As of September 30, 2025, we had a borrowing capacity of $2.7 billion available on our RI Credit Facilities (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $1.3 billion.\nIn connection with the closing of the RI Credit Facilities, the Fund entered into a newly-established $1.38 billion unsecured credit facility, for which we are a guarantor, which provides for (a) an up to $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and (b) an up to $380.0 million unsecured delayed draw term loan which is available to be drawn for twelve months after April 29, 2025 (the \"Closing Date\") (collectively, the “Fund Credit Facilities”). The revolving credit facility under the Fund Credit Facilities matures in April 2029 and the delayed draw term loan under the Fund Credit Facilities matures in April 2028. The Fund Credit Facilities also include two six-month extensions for each facility, which can be exercised at our option. The aggregate amount under the Fund Credit Facilities can be increased to up to $2.0 billion pursuant to an accordion expansion feature, which is subject to obtaining lender commitments. As of September 30, 2025, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.3 billion available on our Fund Credit Facilities (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $122.0 million.\nNote Covenants\nThe following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. These calculations, which are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance. The actual amounts as of September 30, 2025, are:\nNote Covenants\nRequired\nActual\nLimitation on incurrence of total debt\n<\n 60% of adjusted assets\n41.9\n%\nLimitation on incurrence of secured debt\n<\n 40% of adjusted assets\n0.2\n%\nDebt service and fixed charge coverage (trailing 12 months)\n (1)\n>\n 1.5x\n4.6x\nMaintenance of total unencumbered assets\n>\n 150% of unsecured debt\n239.5\n%\n(1) \nOur debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumptions that: (i) the incurrence of any Debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other Debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our Debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters and subject to certain additional adjustments. Such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of the first day of four-quarter period, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period.\n \nFixed charge coverage is calculated in the same manner as the debt service coverage. The following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage as of September 30, 2025 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):\n-38-\nTable\n of Contents\nNet income attributable to the Company\n$\n962,116\nPlus: interest expense, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs\n1,088,336\nPlus: provision for taxes\n83,648\nPlus: depreciation and amortization\n2,495,436\nPlus: provisions for impairment\n489,891\nPlus: pro forma adjustments\n188,216\nLess: gain on sales of real estate\n(135,196)\nIncome available for debt service, as defined\n$\n5,172,447\nTotal pro forma debt service charge\n$\n1,113,987\nDebt service and fixed charge coverage ratio\n4.6x\nCredit Agency Ratings\nThe borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facilities are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. As of September 30, 2025, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of A3 with a “stable” outlook and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A- with a “stable” outlook. In addition, we were assigned the following ratings on our commercial paper as of September 30, 2025: Moody's Investors Service has assigned a rating of P-2 and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A-2. \nBased on our credit rating agency ratings as of September 30, 2025, our credit facilities provide for (i) USD borrowings at Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 0.725% and (ii) British Pound Sterling (\"GBP\") borrowings at the SONIA plus 0.725%, and (iii) EURO (\"EUR\") borrowings at a benchmark rate selected in accordance with the credit agreement. A revolving credit facility commitment fee of 0.125% is payable on the total commitment amount. The credit agreement also provides flexibility to elect different interest rate tenors or daily rate options for each currency tranche. \nBorrowings under the Fund Credit Facilities bear interest at SOFR plus 0.725%. A revolving credit facility commitment fee of 0.125% is payable on the total commitment amount. In addition, a commitment fee of 0.20% is payable on undrawn delayed draw term loan commitments beginning 91 days after the Closing Date. \nIn addition, our credit facilities provide that the interest rates can range between: (i) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 1.40% if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or our senior unsecured debt is unrated and (ii) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 0.70% if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher. In addition, our credit facilities provide for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 0.30% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.10% for a credit rating of A/A2 or higher. \nWe also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions. If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant.

In 2024, our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $2.69 billion, or approximately 120.1% of our taxable income of $2.24 billion. Certain measures are available to us to reduce or eliminate our tax exposure as a REIT, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes, other than our taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a \"TRS\"), has been made. Our taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our cash on hand and funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. We distributed $2.409 per share to stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, representing 75.5% of our diluted Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"AFFO\") per share of $3.19. \nFuture distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"FFO\"), Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"Normalized FFO\"), AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.\n-40-\nTable\n of Contents\nDistributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our TRSs) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). However, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income.\nDistributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders. Approximately 30.4% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2024, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. \nTotal Revenue\nThe following summarizes our total revenue (in thousands):\nThree months ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine months ended\n September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nRental (excluding reimbursements)\n$\n1,303,985\n$\n1,196,805 \n$\n107,180\n$\n3,780,428 \n$\n3,536,420 \n$\n244,008 \nRental (reimbursements)\n82,517\n74,348 \n8,169\n257,319 \n227,630 \n29,689 \nOther\n84,050\n59,762 \n24,288\n223,688 \n166,793 \n56,895 \nTotal revenue\n$\n1,470,552\n$\n1,330,915 \n$\n139,637\n$\n4,261,435 \n$\n3,930,843 \n$\n330,592 \n-41-\nTable\n of Contents\nRental Revenue (excluding reimbursements)\nThe table below summarizes the increase in rental revenue (excluding reimbursements) in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in thousands): \nThree months ended \nSeptember 30,\nNumber of Properties\n2025\n2024\nChange\nProperties acquired during 2025 & 2024\n620\n$\n90,319 \n$\n19,756 \n$\n70,563 \nSame store rental revenue\n (1)\n14,482\n1,162,326 \n1,146,892 \n15,434 \nConstant currency adjustment\n (2)\nN/A\n(225)\n(6,402)\n6,177 \nProperties sold during and prior to 2025\n578\n1,031 \n13,913 \n(12,882)\nStraight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments\nN/A\n8,754 \n7,507 \n1,247 \nVacant rents, development and other \n(3)\n440\n36,931 \n40,517 \n(3,586)\nOther excluded revenue \n(4)\nN/A\n28,516 \n(170)\n28,686 \nRevenue from unconsolidated entities \n(6)\nN/A\n(25,220)\n(26,767)\n1,547 \nRevenue attributable to noncontrolling interests \n(7)\nN/A\n1,553 \n1,559 \n(6)\nTotal\n$\n1,303,985 \n$\n1,196,805 \n$\n107,180 \nNine months ended\n September 30,\nNumber of Properties\n2025\n2024\nChange\nProperties acquired during 2025 & 2024\n620\n$\n221,567 \n$\n33,549 \n$\n188,018 \nSame store rental revenue\n (1)\n14,482\n3,477,268 \n3,432,682 \n44,586 \nConstant currency adjustment\n (2)\nN/A\n(25,426)\n(27,039)\n1,613 \nProperties sold during and prior to 2025\n578\n9,977 \n53,927 \n(43,950)\nStraight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments\nN/A\n19,199 \n18,201 \n998 \nVacant rents, development and other \n(3)\n440\n110,779 \n109,308 \n1,471 \nOther excluded revenue \n(4)\nN/A\n38,494 \n15,890 \n22,604 \nLess: Spirit rental revenue \n(5)\nN/A\n— \n(47,047)\n47,047 \nRevenue from unconsolidated entities \n(6)\nN/A\n(76,093)\n(57,728)\n(18,365)\nRevenue attributable to noncontrolling interests \n(7)\nN/A\n4,663 \n4,677 \n(14)\nTotal\n$\n3,780,428 \n$\n3,536,420 \n$\n244,008 \n(1)\nThe same store rental revenue percentage increased by 1.3% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024. \n(2)\nFor purposes of comparability, same store rental revenue is presented on a constant currency basis using the exchange rate as of September 30, 2025. \n(3)\nRelates to the aggregate of (i) rental revenue from 319 properties that were available for lease during part of 2025 or 2024 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively and (ii) rental revenue for 121 properties under development or completed developments that do not meet our same store pool definition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\n(4)\n\"Other excluded revenue\" primarily consists of reimbursements related to lease termination fees and other settlement income.\n(5)\nAmounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent rental revenue from Spirit properties, which were not included in our financial statements prior to the close of the merger with Spirit on January 23, 2024.\n(6)\nRepresents our pro-rata share of rental revenue from properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. \n(7)\nRepresents the portion of rental revenue attributable to noncontrolling interest based on their pro-rata ownership. \nFor purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year, except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, or (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. Each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above, explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period. \nOf the 17,009 in-place leases in the portfolio, 13,760, or 80.9%, were under leases that provide for increases in rents through: base rent increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), percentage rent based on a percentage of the clients’ gross sales, fixed increases, or a combination of two or more of the aforementioned rent provisions.\n-42-\nTable\n of Contents\nRent based on a percentage of our clients' gross sales, or percentage rent, was $4.0 million and $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Rent based on a percentage of our clients' gross sales, or percentage rent, was $12.6 million and $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Percentage rent represents less than 1% of rental revenue.\nAs of September 30, 2025, our portfolio of 15,542 properties was 98.7% leased with 204 properties available for lease or sale, as compared to 98.7% leased with 196 properties available for lease as of September 30, 2024. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 4% of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future, given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events.\nRental Revenue (reimbursements)\nA number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. Contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients increased by $8.2 million and $29.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher reimbursable property taxes and maintenance due to growth in our portfolio. \nOther Revenue\nThe following summarizes our total other revenue (in thousands):\nThree months

security costs. \nProperty Expenses (reimbursements)\nProperty expenses (reimbursements) consist of property taxes and operating costs paid on behalf of our clients. Property expenses (reimbursements) increased by $8.2 million and $29.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher reimbursable property taxes and maintenance due to growth in our portfolio. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $13.2 million and $20.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher employee costs and professional fees as we continue to invest in our people and our platform.\n-44-\nTable\n of Contents\nProvisions for Impairment\nThe following table summarizes our provisions for impairment during the periods indicated below (in thousands):\nThree months ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine months ended\n September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nProvisions for impairment of real estate\n$\n75,391 \n$\n33,151 \n$\n42,240 \n$\n315,063 \n$\n208,552 \n$\n106,511 \nProvisions for credit losses\n11,581 \n63,769 \n(52,188)\n31,861 \n74,315 \n(42,454)\nProvisions for impairment\n$\n86,972 \n$\n96,920 \n$\n(9,948)\n$\n346,924 \n$\n282,867 \n$\n64,057 \nProvisions for impairment of real estate increased by $42.2 million and $106.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024, respectively, due primarily to properties that were sold or are more likely than not to be sold in the next twelve months as well as properties leased to clients in bankruptcy. \nProvisions for credit losses decreased by $52.2 million and $42.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024, primarily due to lower credit losses recognized on financing receivables for distressed clients accounted for under sales leaseback transactions.\nMerger, Transaction, and Other Costs, Net\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we incurred $13.3 million and $14.0 million, respectively,\n \nof merger, transaction, and other costs, net consisting primarily of placement fees incurred in fundraising for the Fund.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $8.6 million and $105.5 million, respectively, of merger, transaction, and other costs, net consisting primarily of transaction and integration-related costs related to Spirit and $5.1 million for each of the respective periods related to the lease termination of a legacy corporate facility. \nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nThe following summarizes our property dispositions (dollars in thousands):\nThree months ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine months ended\n September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nNumber of properties sold\n140 \n92 \n48 \n268 \n214 \n54 \nNet sales proceeds\n$\n214,792 \n$\n249,461 \n$\n(34,669)\n$\n424,206 \n$\n451,365 \n$\n(27,159)\nGain on sales of real estate\n$\n49,107 \n$\n50,563 \n$\n(1,456)\n$\n110,210 \n$\n92,290 \n$\n17,920 \nForeign Currency and Derivative (Loss) Gain, net\nWe borrow in the functional currencies of the countries in which we invest.

The increase of $8.5 million and $17.0 million in income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024, respectively, is primarily attributable to higher taxable income in the U.K. and Europe and higher state franchise taxes.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nThe decrease in preferred stock dividends of $2.6 million and $7.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024, respectively, is due to the issuance of Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the Merger. In September 2024, we redeemed all 6.9 million shares of Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. \n-46-\nTable\n of Contents\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\"Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n\")\nNareit established an EBITDA metric for real estate companies (i.e., EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDA\nre\n) it believed would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among REITs. Our definition of “Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n” is generally consistent with the Nareit definition, other than our adjustment to remove foreign currency and derivative gain and loss and merger, transaction, and other costs, net. We define Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent quarter as earnings (net income) before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) provisions for impairment, (v) merger, transaction, and other costs, net, (vi) gain on sales of real estate, (vii) foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, net, and (viii) our proportionate share of adjustments from unconsolidated entities. Our Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n reported by other companies or as defined by Nareit, and other companies may interpret or define Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n differently than we do. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n to be a meaningful measure of a REIT’s performance because it provides a view of our operating performance, analyzes our ability to meet interest payment obligations before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, provisions for impairment, gain on sales of real estate and other items, as defined above, that affect comparability, including the removal of non-recurring and non-cash items that industry observers believe are less relevant to evaluating the operating performance of a company. In addition, EBITDA\nre\n is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders, investors, rating agencies, and others as a means of evaluating the operational cash generating capacity of a company prior to servicing debt obligations. Management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n metric, which we refer to as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, is meaningful because it represents our current earnings run rate for the period presented. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n and Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, as defined below, are also used to determine the vesting of performance share awards granted to executive officers. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nshould be considered along with, but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance. We define Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, subject to certain adjustments to incorporate Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we disposed of during the applicable quarter, and include transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period. Our calculation includes all adjustments consistent with the requirements to present Adjusted EBITDA\nre \non a pro forma basis in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes. We believe Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is a useful non-GAAP supplemental measure, as it excludes investments that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from investments acquired during the quarter. Management also uses our ratios of Net Debt/Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n and Net Debt/Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nas measures of leverage in assessing our financial performance, which is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share of debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents), divided by annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nand annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, respectively.\n-47-\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nand\n \nAnnualized Pro Forma EBITDA\nre\n calculations for the periods indicated below (dollars in thousands):\nThree months ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet income\n$\n317,674 \n$\n271,124 \nInterest\n294,482 \n261,261 \nIncome taxes\n23,824 \n15,355 \nDepreciation and amortization\n631,981 \n602,339 \nProvisions for impairment\n86,972 \n96,920 \nMerger, transaction, and other costs, net\n13,343 \n8,610 \nGain on sales of real estate\n(49,107)\n(50,563)\nForeign currency and derivative loss, net\n2,818 \n1,672 \nProportionate share of adjustments from unconsolidated entities\n19,692 \n20,340 \nQuarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n$\n1,341,679 \n$\n1,227,058 \nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre \n(1)\n$\n5,366,716 \n$\n4,908,232 \nAnnualized Pro Forma Adjustments \n$\n17,724 \n$\n29,347 \nAnnualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n$\n5,384,440 \n$\n4,937,579 \nTotal debt per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts    \n$\n28,678,459 \n$\n26,437,045 \nProportionate share of unconsolidated entities debt, excluding deferred financing costs\n659,190 \n659,190 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n(417,173)\n(396,956)\nNet Debt \n(2)\n$\n28,920,476 \n$\n26,699,279 \nNet Debt/Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre \n5.4\nx\n5.4\nx\nNet Debt/Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n5.4\nx\n5.4\nx\n(1)\n We calculate Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n by multiplying the Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n by four.\n(2)\n Net Debt is total debt per our consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share of debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents. \nAs described above, the Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments, which include transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, consist of adjustments to incorporate the Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n from investments we disposed of during the applicable quarter, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the periods, consistent with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X.

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative.  \n-49-\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to FFO and Normalized FFO.

Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement, but they may use the term “CAD” (for Cash Available for Distribution), “FAD” (for Funds Available for Distribution) or other terms. Our AFFO calculations may not be comparable to AFFO, CAD or FAD reported by other companies, and other companies may interpret or define such terms differently than we do.\nWe believe the non-GAAP financial measure AFFO provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies. In particular, AFFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s on-going operating performance. Therefore, we believe that AFFO is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate U.S. GAAP performance metric to which AFFO should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders. Presentation of the information regarding FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments.\n-51-\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Normalized FFO and AFFO.

A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients' gross sales above a specified level.\nWe define total portfolio annualized base rent as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables, as of the balance sheet date, multiplied by 12, excluding percentage rent, interest income on loans and preferred equity investments, and including our pro rata share of such revenues from properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe total portfolio annualized base rent is a useful supplemental operating measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter.

Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. There have been no material changes to the Critical Accounting Policies disclosed in our annual report on \nForm 10-K\n for the year ended December 31, 2024. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures and New Accounting Standards, to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report."
