The world’s most innovative technology companies use our solutions and services to deliver transformational products to multiple industries that drive the global economy. The products these companies develop are some of the most complex systems in the world. Since our inception, we have been at the forefront of technology innovation. We work closely with our customers, helping them solve their most complex challenges in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries to unlock limitless opportunities.\nOur customers include semiconductor companies that design and manufacture semiconductor devices and systems companies that design and manufacture products containing many different types of semiconductors, which they either make themselves or buy from a semiconductor company. Semiconductors, also referred to as integrated circuits (“ICs”), or chips, are the heart of almost every industry. Semiconductors are the catalyst for innovation in many industries including automotive, aerospace, biotech, hyperscale and cloud computing, data centers, telecommunications, medical technology, industrial internet of things (“IIoT”), and AI. They are found in a wide variety of consumer products such as cell phones, automobiles, computers, home appliances, home security, drones, and home entertainment systems.\n \nBusiness Strategy\nOur Intelligent System Design™ (“ISD”) strategy allows us to deliver solutions to our customers to solve their most complex product development challenges. Our industry-leading computational software, accelerated hardware, and IP enable us to adapt to our customer's dynamic design requirements, allowing them to meet their critical business and environmental concerns including time-to-market and sustainability. The creation of even the most seemingly simple electronic systems and products typically includes a complex design process and requires highly trained engineers with various areas of specialized knowledge and skill sets. Our ability to deliver innovative products that keep up with increasing complexity allows our customers to be successful in meeting their business goals and objectives.\nHistorically, the industry that provided the software tools IC engineers used was called Electronic Design Automation (“EDA”). The pace of technical innovation in EDA has been driven by a concept known as Moore’s Law, which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ICs would double approximately every 18-24 months. Our strategy, illustrated in the graphic below, is focused on three primary areas: Design Excellence, System Innovation, and Pervasive Intelligence.\nDesign Excellence\n focuses on our core technology and deep understanding of computational software, accelerated computing, machine learning, and AI to develop best-in-class electronic design and analysis semiconductor solutions. In this area, customers are primarily developing large chips including those used in computers, laptops, cellphones, medical devices, games and entertainment systems, and many other types of consumer electronics. Design Excellence applies to all types of semiconductor electronics including CPUs, GPUs, MCUs, memory, radio frequency (“RF”), analog, and mixed-signal, in both mainstream and advanced semiconductor process nodes.\n1\nTable of Contents\nSystem Innovation\n builds on our foundation of Design Excellence and deep expertise in computational algorithms and expands that expertise to include multiphysics-based analysis of systems that contain electronic devices, including printed circuit boards (“PCBs”), devices with advanced packaging technology, and 3-dimensional IC (“3D-IC”). This gives customers designing full systems containing multiple electronic devices, the ability to verify that their products will work as intended under various physical conditions. Some examples of electronic systems are a computer motherboard, the electronics in a cellphone, or the electronic transmission or infotainment system in an automobile.\nPervasive Intelligence\n incorporates AI training and inference algorithms in our solutions to help customers optimize performance and productivity with improved quality of results for their products. The amount of data produced in the design phase of their products has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. We implement generative AI agents to analyze large data sets and break through the limitations of the conventional human-intensive optimization process to achieve optimal design solutions expeditiously and without compromising accuracy. \nOur software and hardware products also support cloud access to address our customers' growing computational needs. Customers can access our solutions via our Cadence OnCloud Platform.\nBusiness Drivers\nOur products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative semiconductor and electronic systems that are driven by key trends, including foundries creating new advanced transistor devices and processes, semiconductor companies designing electrical systems, systems companies designing semiconductors, the hyper-convergence between electrical and mechanical systems, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving, and 5G. These trends are accelerated by the AI super cycle. Demand for our technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity and our customers’ need to invest in new designs and products that are highly differentiated. \nGenerative AI is reshaping the entire semiconductor and systems industry development process. From our perspective, the AI super cycle we are experiencing will influence our key business opportunities along three horizons, which are Infrastructure AI, Physical AI and Life Sciences AI. The first horizon, Infrastructure AI, is being driven by data centers and hyperscale computing to provide the necessary power to run AI workloads. The second horizon, Physical AI, is the integration of AI with autonomous systems. It will drive many applications such as automobiles, industrial robots, and many other autonomous systems. The third horizon, Life Sciences AI, is the application of AI and computer science to biology to drive advancements in the medical and life sciences industries.\nUnderlying the requirements within any particular vertical sector is the availability of rapidly improving IC manufacturing technology. In order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements, some of our products need to first incorporate new capabilities such that they can exploit new manufacturing capabilities. This dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development (“R&D”) to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products.\n2\nTable of Contents\nAnother driver for our business is the differentiation, capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products. With the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address growing key challenges associated with the design of electronic products, such as power consumption, performance, chip area and cost. Our products and services have differentiated attributes that our customers value. In general, these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results (in terms of power consumption, performance and chip area), engineering productivity, tool performance, manufacturability, reliability and faster time to market. Many of these attributes contribute to sustainability initiatives by enabling our customers to create innovative products that optimize power, space and energy.\nProduct Categories\nEngineers use our solutions to complete critical steps in the design process, which includes creating, implementing, and verifying the design for functionality, manufacturability and other required industry-related compliance standards. Much of an engineer's time spent with our solutions during the design process involves running simulations to verify that their design will work as expected. Our technology, enhanced by AI, allows our customers to build a virtual model or digital twin that accurately predicts how their design will work. The ability to perform these simulations leads to significant time and cost savings for our customers as they can find and fix critical design problems before building their products. Our customers rely on our solutions to ensure their products perform safely and reliably.\nIn alignment with our Intelligent System Design strategy, we define our solutions in three product categories: Core EDA, Semiconductor IP, and System Design and Analysis (“SD&A”). Core EDA includes our software, hardware, and services used to design and verify a wide variety of semiconductors. Our Semiconductor IP portfolio includes silicon subsystems, software, and services that are used in semiconductor design. The SD&A category includes our software and services used to design and verify a wide variety of physical electronic systems. Leveraging our AI and computational software expertise, we have integrated the multiphysics domain (also known as “computational fluid dynamics,” or “CFD”) with our EDA solutions to provide customers with complete system-level design and analysis solutions. These categories are tightly integrated to provide complete design solutions for our customers. \nCore EDA\nOur Core EDA product category addresses the design and verification for a wide variety of semiconductor chips and manufacturing process technologies. Examples of the types of chips include analog, custom, digital, mixed-signal, memory, microwave, silicon photonics, and RF. The types of devices addressed by Core EDA covers a wide range of industries including automotive, aero and defense, hyperscale computing and data center, mobile communication, medical devices, and consumer electronics. As the complexity of chip design, semiconductor process technology, and electronic system design has increased, we have been incorporating the latest advances in machine learning and generative AI to drive significant improvements for our customers’ design quality of results and engineering productivity. \nCustom IC Design and Simulation\nVirtuoso Studio is the foundation of our solution platform for custom, analog, mixed-signal, photonics, and RF semiconductors. It is a complete AI-enabled solution that integrates the key Cadence technology required for silicon design, layout, and verification. Engineers use this solution to define the chip functionality (schematic) and physical layout descriptions for the complete design of chips, advanced packaged devices, and PCBs. Designs are functionally verified in simulation with the Spectre simulation solution. We believe Spectre is the gold standard for circuit design including analog, custom, memory, silicon photonics, and RF. Pegasus Physical Verification, our physical verification solution, is fully integrated with Virtuoso.\nDigital IC Design and Signoff\nThe Innovus Implementation System is the foundation of our full-flow digital IC design and signoff solution. A typical digital full-flow solution has four primary areas, which include creating the functional description (design synthesis), performing functional verification, running the physical implementation (place and route), and performing sign-off checks for manufacturing. The Innovus Implementation System is integrated with the key full-flow solution areas. For functional design, customers use the Genus Synthesis solution. For sign-off checks, customers use the Quantus Extraction, Timing Signoff, Voltus C Power Integrity, and Pegasus Physical Verification solutions. While these are the main areas in the digital flow, there are other important technology solutions for a comprehensive flow that includes the need for test synthesis, logic equivalence checking, high level power analysis, and optimization. The solutions are Joules™ RTL Power, which is designed to deliver fast power analysis while preserving near-signoff accuracy, and Cadence Modus DFT software, which reduces system-on-chip (“SoC”) design-for-test time. Cadence Cerebrus™ is our generative AI solution that combines all elements of the full-flow IC through signoff, enabling additional productivity, automation, and improved quality of results throughout the entire design flow.\nFunctional Verification\nAs mentioned above, functional verification is an important aspect of the design process. Design engineers rely heavily on the capability to verify that the chip's functional description is equivalent to the physical description used to manufacture the silicon. Functional verification is done multiple times throughout the design process as changes are incorporated, with the objective of identifying as many potential functional issues as possible before manufacturing the circuitry, thereby significantly reducing the risk of discovering a costly error in the completed product. We offer two functional verification software solutions, the Jasper Formal Verification Platform, and the Xcelium™ Parallel Logic Simulation Platform. These software solutions help engineers compare the functional view of the design with its physical view to make sure they match and help ensure that the design will successfully pass all functional tests.\n3\nTable of Contents\nOur hardware acceleration and software prototyping solutions address another important aspect of functional verification in design flows. This capability is essential for chips that are used in high-performance computers like microprocessors, graphics processors, and AI processor chips. Some of the functional tests for these designs are so large that they may take weeks or even months to complete. Hardware acceleration, also known as emulation, and software prototyping can reduce these large simulations to hours or a few days. Our Palladium\n®\n Enterprise Emulation Platform and Protium™ field programmable gate arrays (“FPGA”)-Based Prototyping Platforms are for more comprehensive chip verification, often running low-level embedded software on top of a model of the chip, to ensure proper functionality before silicon manufacturing. These engines are used for early bug detection, verification of block-level functionality, verification acceleration and emulation of system-level functionality, system-level power exploration, analysis and optimization, and system-level prototyping for hardware/software co-verification. Our Palladium platform provides high throughput, capacity, data center reliability, and workgroup productivity to enable global design teams to develop advanced hardware-software systems. The Protium platform leverages a common front end with the Palladium environment to move designs rapidly from emulation to the prototyping stage, enabling software development to begin weeks to months earlier than otherwise possible. Verisium™ is our generative AI solution for multi-run verification that enables additional productivity, automation, and quality of results throughout the entire verification flow. \nSemiconductor IP\nOur semiconductor IP product category includes strategic and mission-critical design architectures that our customers use to integrate into their highly differentiated design blocks, SoC subsystems, and chiplets. These are typically designed into silicon chips that are found in high volume in multiple markets such as automotive, hyperscale, mobile computing, and many consumer products including mobile phones, and AI chips. Our IP offerings include controllers and physical interfaces, which are commonly used in computing, networking, and embedded systems. We have a broad portfolio of PCI Express, Universal Accelerator Link, Compute Express Link, multiple memory interfaces including High Bandwidth Memory and Graphics Double Data Rate, and many other standards. In addition, our portfolio includes a wide variety of digital signal processor IPs. Our Tensilica\n®\n configurable digital signal processors are vertically targeted subsystems for AI, audio/voice, baseband and vision/imaging applications, controllers and physical interfaces for standard protocols and analog IP. Our design IP portfolio includes solutions for high speed serializer/deserializer (“SerDes”), peripheral component interconnect (“PCI”), USB, and many other standards. In addition to the IP portfolio listed above, customers rely on our Verification IP (“VIP”) portfolio to perform system-level validation. The VIP models are designed to work seamlessly with our Xcelium™ simulator and Palladium\n®\n Enterprise Emulation solutions. \nWe also offer design services to provide customers with end-to-end solutions from design specifications to final working silicon. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired Invecas, a leading provider of design engineering, embedded software, and system-level solutions. With this acquisition, we have added a highly skilled system design engineering team with expertise in providing IP design services for a wide variety of advanced node and mixed-signal chip designs, verification, product engineering, advanced packaging, and embedded software.\nSystem Design and Analysis\nOur SD&A product category is a comprehensive multiphysics platform that helps our customers design and simulate electronics and entire systems. It encompasses key areas of analysis including electromagnetic, thermal, structure, computational fluid dynamics, molecular, PCB and packaging, mechanical and structural analysis. \nThe capabilities in the Allegro\n®\n System Design Platform include PCB design and implementation, IC package and system-in-package design, signal and power integrity analysis, and PCB library design management and collaboration. The need for compact, high-performance mobile, consumer, and automotive design with advanced serial interconnect is driving the technological evolution of our PCB offerings. For mainstream PCB customers, where individual or small team productivity is a focus, we provide the OrCAD\n®\n family of offerings, which are primarily marketed worldwide through a network of resellers. Allegro X AI™ is our generative AI solution designed to provide significant cycle-time compression for PCB design, enhancing an engineer’s productivity.\nThe speed and proximity of signals on silicon, through packages to boards, and through connectors and cables, exposes these communications to various kinds of interference, generates heat, and emits electromagnetic radiation. Careful analysis is required for these systems to work as designed under a wide range of operating conditions, standards, and regulatory laws. The complexity of these devices and signal transmissions requires analysis and simulation throughout the product lifecycle to meet these objectives. Our Clarity\n™\n 3D Solver for electromagnetic and power electronics analysis and simulation, as well as our Celsius\n™\n Thermal Solver, provide the foundation for multiphysics analysis technology, with complete electrical-thermal co-simulation for electronic systems from ICs to physical enclosures. \nOur Fidelity™ CFD Software expands our ability to meet the growing design challenges of electronic and systems companies. Fidelity CFD is a physics-based analysis solution for mechanical design and complements the electronic system analysis portfolio. Our comprehensive suite of computational fluid dynamics (“CFD”) solutions enables our customers to extend their multiphysics analysis workflows to address simulation and analysis challenges for applications such as aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, propulsion, turbomachinery, heat transfer, and combustion. Optimality™ Intelligent System Explorer is the industry’s first generative AI-driven multiphysics optimization solution. It delivers additional productivity, automation, and improved system-level power, performance and area and quality of results throughout the entire analysis flow. \n4\nTable of Contents\nOur Cadence Reality Digital Twin platform brings physics-based design and analysis to the data center sector for performance-aware design and operational planning. Data center professionals can future-proof designs and assess operational decisions with this digital twin and empower designers, owners, and operators to address the need for reliability, capacity, and energy efficiency.\nWith our acquisition of BETA CAE Systems International AG (“BETA CAE”) in fiscal 2024, we expanded our multiphysics simulation capabilities to include mechanical and structural analysis. BETA CAE’s industry-leading solutions include ANSA for pre-processing and full-flow model development, META for post-processing and analysis, EPILYSIS for structural analysis, and FATIQ for fatigue and failure analysis.

Millennium M1 is the first release and is designed to overcome traditional CFD speed/accuracy and compute resource limitations with a combination of GPU resident CFD solvers such as Fidelity LES for large eddy simulations (“LES”) and scalable high-performance hardware.\nFor 3D-IC and multi-chiplet designs, our customers use the Cadence\n®\n Integrity™ 3D-IC Platform. Built on the Innovus solution, Integrity allows system-level designers to plan, implement, and analyze stacked die systems for a variety of packaging styles (2.5D or 3D). Integrity 3D-IC is the industry’s first integrated system and SoC-level solution that enables system analysis, including co-design, with Virtuoso and Allegro implementation environments. \nWe also offer molecular modeling and simulation solutions and services. These solutions and services are used by a wide range of organizations in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors to accelerate the drug discovery process and make more informed decisions in developing new therapeutics.\nProduct Arrangements\nWe primarily license our software using time-based licenses. Our time-based license arrangements offer customers the right to access and use all of the products delivered at the outset of an arrangement and updates throughout the entire term of the arrangement, which is generally two to three years, with no rights to return. In addition, certain time-based license arrangements include the right for the customer to remix among the products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and use unspecified additional products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement.\nA small portion of our software is licensed under perpetual licenses, which does not include the right to use new technology. Payment terms for time-based licenses generally provide for payments to be made over the license period, and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.\nOur hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers. Our emulation hardware can also be accessed remotely via a Cadence-managed cloud arrangement.\nWe generally license our design IP under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs. Some customers enter into non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services. In addition, for certain IP license agreements, we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our IP to their customers.\nFor a further description of our license agreements, our hardware sale or lease agreements, revenue recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to the discussion under “Critical Accounting Estimates” under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nTechnical Support and Maintenance\nCustomer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products. We provide our customers with technical support and maintenance to facilitate their use of our software, hardware and IP solutions.\nOur education services offerings can be customized and include training programs that are delivered online, through an app, or in a classroom setting. The content of these offerings ranges from the latest design techniques to methodologies for using the most recent features of our products. The primary focus of education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to productivity in the use of our products.\nServices\nWe offer a number of services, including design services, services related to methodology, education and hosted design solutions. These services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the license, sale or lease of our products. As necessary, specialized design services engineers are assigned to internal R&D projects associated with our design IP business. \nAs part of our services offerings, we design advanced ICs, develop custom IP and help customers address design challenges. This enables us to target and accelerate the development of new software technology and products to satisfy current and future design requirements. \n5\nTable of Contents\nWe offer engineering services to collaborate with our customers in the design of complex ICs and the implementation of key design capabilities, including low power design, IC packaging and board design, functional verification, digital implementation, analog/mixed-signal design and system-level design. The customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, mobile, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and life science vertical sectors. These ICs range from digital SoCs and analog and RF designs to complex mixed-signal ICs. \nThe Cadence Cloud portfolio, which consists of Cadence-managed and customer-managed cloud environments, continues to expand, with additional cloud-based and software as a service (“SaaS”) products, including cloud-based solutions for SD&A and functional verification. Contractual arrangements with customers for both environments are generally time-based, similar to the on-premises software license arrangements described above, and may include usage-based terms. \nIn delivering methodology services, we leverage our experience and knowledge of design techniques, our products, leading practices and different design environments to enable improved productivity of our customers’ engineering teams. Depending on the customers’ projects and needs, we work with customers using outsourced, consultative and collaborative offerings.\nThird-Party Programs and Initiatives\nIn addition to our products, many customers use design tools that are provided by other companies, as well as design IP available from alternative suppliers. We support the use of third-party design products and design IP through our Cadence Connections\n®\n program and through our participation in industry groups such as the Silicon Integration Initiative and Accellera System Initiative. We actively contribute to the development and deployment of industry standards.\nProduct and Maintenance and Services Revenue\nRevenue, and revenue as a percentage of total revenue, from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except percentages)\nProduct and maintenance\n$\n4,213 \n91 \n%\n$\n3,834 \n94 \n%\n$\n3,340 \n94 \n%\nServices\n428 \n9 \n%\n256 \n6 \n%\n222 \n6 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n4,641 \n$\n4,090 \n$\n3,562 \nRecurring revenue includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. Recurring revenue also includes revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of other arrangements with non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services. These arrangements do not meet the definition of a revenue contract until the customer executes a separate selection form to identify the products and services that they are purchasing. Each separate selection form under the arrangement is treated as an individual contract and accounted for based on the respective performance obligations.\nThe remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by sales of hardware and individual IP licenses and certain software licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue is impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period.\nFor additional information and analysis on our revenue, including revenue by geography, see the discussion under “Results of Operations” under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For our fiscal 2024 results of operations and our financial position as of December 31, 2024, see Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. We have elected to exclude the potential future royalty receipts from the remaining performance obligations. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, which included $0.5 billion of non-cancelable commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. \nWe estimate our remaining performance obligations at a point in time. Actual amounts and timing of revenue recognition may differ from these estimates largely due to changes in actual installation and delivery dates, as well as contract renewals, modifications and terminations. As of December 31, 2024, we expected to recognize 54% of the contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations, excluding non-cancelable commitments, as revenue over the next 12 months, 42% over the next 13 to 36 months and the remainder thereafter.\n6\nTable of Contents\nMarketing and Sales\nWe generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of salespeople and applications engineers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales and post-sales support for our products. Due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring up to six months or longer. During the sales cycle, our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations, product demonstrations and support for on-site customer evaluation of our solutions. We also promote our products and services through advertising, marketing automation, trade shows, public relations and the internet. We selectively utilize value-added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales. Our OrCAD products and certain Allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels. With respect to international sales, we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries. We also use a third-party distributor to license our products and services to certain customers in Japan.\nResearch and Development    \nOur future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. The primary areas of our R&D align with our product categories discussed above. We must continuously adapt our products to solve new or increased physics challenges that arise with each successive process node and address the increase in complexity that is introduced by the resulting much larger designs. We must also keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D.\nHardware Manufacturing and Software Distribution\nOur hardware, including all individual PCBs, custom ICs and FPGA-based prototyping components, is manufactured, assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers. Software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery. \nProprietary Technology\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Many of our products include software or other IP licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third-party software and other IP in the future. As part of performing engineering services for customers, our engineering services business uses certain software and other IP licensed from third parties, including that of our competitors.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to our business and operations. These include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations related to trade controls, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and data privacy and data protection and AI, as well as antitrust, competition, employment, income taxes and the environment. \nTrade\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions concerning the sale, shipment and transmission of our products and technology outside the United States and to foreign nationals, including tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, sanctions and other trade regulations. The Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) of the U.S. Department of Commerce maintains and frequently adds entities to the “Entity List,” which limits our ability to deliver products and services to these entities, some of which are our customers. BIS has issued restrictions concerning advanced node IC production in China and other countries and extended controls to additional technologies, including electronic computer-aided design software specially designed for the development of advanced node ICs, and issued export controls related to the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing, advanced computing, and supercomputer industries. These restrictions and any subsequent restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, either directly or by impacting our customers’ products, and restrict our ability to license or support our products to certain companies in China. Furthermore, increased restrictions on China exports may lead to regulatory retaliation by the Chinese government and possibly further escalate geopolitical tensions, and any such scenarios may adversely impact our business. The prospect of future export controls that are implemented in a similar manner may continue to have an ongoing impact on our business, results of operation, or financial conditions.\nTrade regulations limiting or banning sales into certain countries or to certain companies, including economic and financial sanctions and trade embargoes administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), have impacted our ability to transact business in certain countries and with certain customers. Future trade regulations may also impact our ability to transact business with certain customers and in certain countries and may restrict certain non-U.S. person employees from performing their duties at Cadence without first obtaining appropriate authorization if their duties involve an export, reexport, or transfer of export-controlled technology. \n7\nTable of Contents\nAnti-corruption and anti-bribery\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials and bribes to other persons. \nData privacy and data protection \nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions governing data privacy and data protection, including the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation, which regulate our collection, handling and use of personal information.\nThe laws and regulations to which we are subject are complex and may change or develop over time, sometimes with limited or no advance notice. Developments or other changes in laws or regulations or how they are interpreted or enforced have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and increase our compliance-related expenditures. \n Artificial intelligence\nThe regulatory framework governing the use of AI, machine learning and automated decision-making technologies (“AI Technologies”) is rapidly evolving. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. \nAlready, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI Technologies, and new laws regulating AI Technologies have been enacted in China, the United States and the European Union. In the United States, the Trump administration has rescinded an executive order relating to AI Technologies that was previously implemented by the Biden administration and may continue to rescind other existing federal orders and/or administrative policies relating to AI Technologies, or may implement new executive orders and/or other rule-making relating to AI Technologies in the future. U.S. legislation is also advancing at the state level. For example, the California Privacy Protection Agency is currently in the process of finalizing regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act regarding the use of automated decision-making. The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the “EU AI Act”) applies to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and – depending on the AI use case - includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. Such additional regulations may impact our ability to develop, use and commercialize AI Technologies in the future.\nFor additional information regarding risks related to laws and regulations, including existing restrictions imposed by BIS, as well as international relations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nCompetition\nWe compete most frequently with Synopsys, Inc., Siemens EDA, and ANSYS, Inc., and also with numerous other tools providers, electronics device manufacturers with their own EDA capabilities, technical or computational software companies, electronics design and consulting companies and other IP companies.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.\nBusiness Overview\nCadence\n®\n is a global market leader that develops computational, AI-driven software, accelerated hardware, and IP solutions for engineers and scientists to bring new and innovative products to life. The world’s most innovative technology companies use our solutions and services to deliver transformational products to multiple industries that drive the global economy. The products these companies develop are some of the most complex systems in the world. Since our inception, we have been at the forefront of technology innovation. We work closely with our customers, helping them solve their most complex challenges in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries to unlock limitless opportunities. \nOur strategy allows us to deliver solutions to our customers to solve their most complex product development challenges. Our industry-leading computational software, specialized accelerated hardware, and IP enable us to adapt to our customer’s dynamic design requirements, allowing them to meet their critical business and environmental concerns including time-to-market and sustainability. The creation of even the most seemingly simple electronic systems and products often requires a complex design process and requires highly trained engineers with various areas of specialized knowledge and skill sets. Our ability to deliver innovative products that keep up with increasing complexity allows our customers to be successful in meeting their business goals and objectives.\nWe group our products into the following categories:\n•\nCore EDA\n•\nIP; and\n•\nSystem Design and Analysis.\nFor additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Product Categories.”\nManagement uses certain performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nRecent Acquisitions\nConsistent with our Intelligent System Design strategy, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed our acquisition of Invecas, a leading provider of design engineering, embedded software and system-level solutions. We believe the addition of a skilled engineering team with vast experience in delivering end-to-end system solutions with deep expertise in advanced nodes, mixed-signal, verification, embedded software, packaging and turnkey custom silicon production will enhance our ability to pursue attractive opportunities in the markets we serve. Revenue and cost of revenue associated with contracts assumed with our acquisition of Invecas is primarily classified as services revenue and cost of services in our consolidated income statements.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed our acquisition of BETA CAE, a system analysis platform provider of multi-domain, engineering simulation solutions. The acquisition of BETA CAE expands our multiphysics system analysis suite with highly complementary products, enabling us to offer a more comprehensive portfolio to customers in the automotive sector and at companies in the aerospace, industrial and healthcare industries. Revenue associated with contracts assumed with our acquisition of BETA CAE is primarily classified as product and maintenance revenue in our System Design and Analysis product category. Cost of revenue associated with these contracts is primarily classified as cost of product and maintenance in our consolidated income statements.\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Environment\nBecause we operate globally, our business is subject to the effects of economic downturns or recessions in the regions in which we do business, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, inflation, changing interest rates, expanded trade control laws and regulations, potential imposition of new or higher tariffs and geopolitical conflicts.\nWe have been impacted by the continued expansion of trade control laws and regulations, including certain export control restrictions concerning advanced node IC production in China, the inclusion of additional Chinese technology companies on the Bureau of Industry and Security “Entity List” and regulations governing the sale of certain technologies. Based on our current assessments, we expect the impact of these expanded trade control laws and regulations on our business to be limited. In addition, President Trump has announced the imposition of broad-based tariffs on imports from many countries, including China and Mexico. We are monitoring the imposition of these new or higher tariffs, including any pauses on the tariffs imposed, and will assess their potential impact on our business either directly, such as on our hardware business, or due to downstream effects.\nWe also continuously monitor geopolitical conflicts around the world, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, and assess their impact on our business. To date, these conflicts have not materially limited our ability to develop or support our products and have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\n33\nTable of Contents\nWhile our business model provides some resilience against these factors, we will continue to monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these or similar circumstances on our business and financial results. For additional information on the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion of our fiscal 2024 consolidated results of operations includes year-over-year comparisons to fiscal 2023 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other non-operating income and expenses, income taxes and cash flows. For a discussion of the fiscal 2023 changes compared to fiscal 2022, see the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024.\nResults of operations for fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, reflect the following:\n•\nGrowth in revenue from our software, services, IP and hardware offerings;\n•\nContinued investment in research and development activities and technical sales support, including headcount from acquisitions;\n•\nIncremental costs for professional services; and\n•\nIncreased interest expense from our indebtedness.\nRevenue\nWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our hardware products, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.\nRecurring revenue includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware products, and operating leases of hardware. Recurring revenue also includes revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of other arrangements with non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services. \nThe remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of hardware products, individual IP licenses and certain software licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies in any single fiscal period are primarily impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers.\nThe following table shows the percentage of our revenue that is classified as recurring or up-front for fiscal 2024 and 2023: \n \n2024\n2023\nRevenue recognized over time\n80 \n%\n81 \n%\nRevenue from arrangements with non-cancelable commitments\n3 \n%\n3 \n%\nRecurring revenue\n83 \n%\n84 \n%\nUp-front revenue\n17 \n%\n16 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nThe percentage of revenue characterized as recurring compared to revenue characterized as up-front may vary between fiscal quarters. We expect our percentage of annual up-front revenue to continue to increase in 2025 as growth in our product offerings for which revenue is recognized up-front is expected to be greater than the growth of our product offerings for which revenue is recognized over time\nThe following table shows the percentage of recurring revenue for the twelve-month periods ended concurrently with our five most recent fiscal quarters:\n \nTrailing Twelve Months Ended \n \nDecember 31,\n2024\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nJune 30,\n2024\nMarch 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nRecurring revenue\n83 \n%\n86 \n%\n87 \n%\n87 \n%\n84 \n%\nUp-front revenue\n17 \n%\n14 \n%\n13 \n%\n13 \n%\n16 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n34\nTable of Contents\nRevenue by Year\nThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2024 and 2023 and the change in revenue between years:\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nProduct and maintenance\n$\n4,213.5 \n$\n3,834.4 \n$\n379.1 \n10 \n%\nServices\n427.8 \n255.6 \n172.2 \n67 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n4,641.3 \n$\n4,090.0 \n$\n551.3 \n13 \n%\nProduct and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to growth in revenue from our software, hardware and IP offerings as a result of customers’ continued investment in complex designs for their products.\nServices revenue increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to growth in revenue from our design service offerings, which were supplemented by our acquisition of Invecas. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and IP performance obligations.\nNo one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2024 or 2023.\nRevenue by Product Category\nThe following table shows the percentage of revenue contributed by each of our product categories during fiscal 2024 and 2023:\n \n2024\n2023\nCore EDA\n71 \n%\n76 \n%\nIP\n13 \n%\n12 \n%\nSystem Design and Analysis\n16 \n%\n12 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nRevenue from any one product category as a percentage of total revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of products and services sold in a given period and the timing of revenue recognition, particularly for our hardware, IP and certain software products. While revenue from our Core EDA product category increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, Core EDA as a percentage of total revenue decreased over the same period. As shown in the table below, revenue from China decreased during the same period and the substantial majority of that decreased revenue is included in the Core EDA category, resulting in lower revenue growth in the Core EDA category compared to both the IP and System Design and Analysis categories. Certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.\n \nRevenue by Geography\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nUnited States\n$\n2,159.7 \n$\n1,694.5 \n$\n465.2 \n27 \n%\nOther Americas\n93.1 \n65.3 \n27.8 \n43 \n%\nChina\n573.1 \n679.5 \n(106.4)\n(16)\n%\nOther Asia\n855.9 \n766.4 \n89.5 \n12 \n%\nEurope, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)\n699.3 \n655.1 \n44.2 \n7 \n%\nJapan\n260.2 \n229.2 \n31.0 \n14 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n4,641.3 \n$\n4,090.0 \n$\n551.3 \n13 \n%\nDuring fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, revenue in the United States increased primarily due to growth in revenue from our hardware, software, IP and service offerings, while revenue in China decreased primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our hardware and IP offerings. Revenue in the remaining geographies presented in the table above increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to growth in revenue from software offerings.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRevenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue\n \n2024\n2023\nUnited States\n47 \n%\n41 \n%\nOther Americas\n2 \n%\n2 \n%\nChina\n12 \n%\n17 \n%\nOther Asia\n18 \n%\n19 \n%\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n15 \n%\n16 \n%\nJapan\n6 \n%\n5 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nMost of our revenue is transacted in the U.S. dollar.

Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period, but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, license third-party technology or IP, and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed assets, technology or IP.\nA summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nProduct and maintenance-related costs\n$\n376.5 \n$\n288.0 \n$\n88.5 \n31 \n%\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n60.1 \n43.8 \n16.3 \n37 \n%\nTotal cost of product and maintenance\n$\n436.6 \n$\n331.8 \n$\n104.8 \n32 \n%\n36\nTable of Contents\nProduct and maintenance-related costs increased during fiscal 2024, when compared to fiscal 2023, due to the following:\n \nChange\n \n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nHardware product costs\n$\n80.1 \nSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs\n4.9 \nOther items\n3.5 \nTotal change in product and maintenance-related costs\n$\n88.5 \nCosts associated with our hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These costs make our cost of hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products. Hardware product costs increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to increased installations of hardware products and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory related to previous generations of our hardware products.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of newly acquired assets relative to assets becoming fully amortized in any given period.\nCost of Services\nCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and direct costs associated with certain design services. Cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects rather than internal development projects and the timing of design service projects being completed. Cost of services increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to increased costs associated with our design service offerings and costs associated with the service offerings from our acquisition of Invecas.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, industry trends for salary and other employee benefits, stock-based compensation, foreign exchange rate movements, acquisition-related costs, and volatility in variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results.\nMany of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the U.S. dollar strengthens in value against other currencies, and we recognize higher expenses when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”\nOur operating expenses for fiscal 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nMarketing and sales\n$\n757.5 \n$\n690.3 \n$\n67.2 \n10 \n%\nResearch and development\n1,549.1 \n1,441.8 \n107.3 \n7 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n282.3 \n242.4 \n39.9 \n16 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n2,588.9 \n$\n2,374.5 \n$\n214.4 \n9 \n%\nOur operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\nMarketing and sales\n16 \n%\n17 \n%\nResearch and development\n34 \n%\n35 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n6 \n%\n6 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n56 \n%\n58 \n%\n37\nTable of Contents\n \nMarketing and Sales\nThe increase in marketing and sales expense were due to the following:\n \nChange\n \n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs\n$\n48.2 \nStock-based compensation\n10.9 \nFacilities and other infrastructure costs\n6.7 \nOther items\n1.4 \nTotal change in marketing and sales expense\n$\n67.2 \nSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs and stock-based compensation included in marketing and sales expense increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to our continued investment in attracting and retaining talent dedicated to technical sales support, including additional headcount from acquisitions. Facilities and other infrastructure costs included in marketing and sales expense increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to our growing workforce. We expect to continue attracting and retaining talent dedicated to technical sales support through hiring and acquisitions.\nResearch and Development\n The increase in research and development expense were due to the following:\n \nChange\n \n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs\n$\n49.1 \nStock-based compensation\n47.0 \nFacilities and other infrastructure costs\n8.4 \nProfessional services\n5.0 \nOther items\n(2.2)\nTotal change in research and development expense\n$\n107.3 \nSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs and stock-based compensation included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, due to our continued investment in attracting and retaining talent for research and development activities, including additional headcount from acquisitions.

We expect to continue attracting and retaining talent dedicated to research and development activities through hiring and acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following:\n \nChange\n \n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nOutside legal fees\n$\n18.7 \nSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs\n12.8 \nEstimated legal liabilities\n8.3 \nForeign service tax\n5.0 \nOther professional services\n3.4 \nStock-based compensation\n3.4 \nContributions to non-profit organizations\n(14.7)\nOther items\n3.0 \nTotal change in general and administrative expense\n$\n39.9 \n38\nTable of Contents\nOutside legal fees included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to increased legal services associated with acquisitions and legal proceedings. For additional information about our legal proceedings, including the increase in estimated legal liabilities, see Note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. \nSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs and stock-based compensation included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to additional headcount from acquisitions. Also, during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, we experienced an increase in foreign service tax expense, because we did not benefit from any foreign service tax refunds as we did during fiscal 2023. Contributions to non-profit organizations decreased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the timing of our periodic contributions to support charitable initiatives, including the Cadence Giving Foundation. \nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks and patents. Amortization in any given period depends primarily on the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets.\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n$\n30.4 \n$\n18.2 \n$\n12.2 \n67 \n%\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to amortization from intangible assets acquired with our fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 acquisitions, partially offset by certain intangible assets that became fully amortized.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nWe have initiated restructuring plans in recent years, most recently in August 2024, to better align our resources with our business strategy. Restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management's estimates during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information. As a result, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. For additional information about our restructuring plans, see Note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nOperating margin\nOperating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue. Our operating margin for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\n2024\n2023\nOperating margin\n29 \n%\n31 \n%\nOperating margin decreased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the mix of products and services sold during each respective period. In addition, our acquisitions during fiscal 2024 resulted in incremental expenses, including amortization of acquired intangibles, that exceeded incremental revenue.\n39\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was comprised of the following:\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nContractual cash interest expense:\nSenior Notes\n$\n46.0 \n$\n15.3 \nTerm Loans\n25.9 \n17.7 \nRevolving Credit Facility\n0.7 \n2.0 \nAmortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs:\nSenior Notes\n1.9 \n0.9 \nTerm Loans\n1.2 \n0.2 \nRevolving Credit Facility\n0.4 \n— \nOther\n(0.1)\n0.1 \nTotal interest expense\n$\n76.0 \n$\n36.2 \n Interest expense increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the interest expense related to new debt issued during fiscal 2024. We expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2025 due to the increased level of debt on our consolidated balance sheet compared to prior periods. For an additional description of our debt arrangements, see Note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments in debt securities, realized and unrealized gains and losses from our investments in equity securities of other companies, gains and losses from investments held in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation (“NQDC”) trust and foreign exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense), net increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to increased interest earned from deposits and net gains from our investments in equity securities of publicly held companies. For additional information about other income (expense), net, see Note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 and 2023:\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n340.3 \n$\n240.8 \nEffective tax rate\n24.4 \n%\n18.8 \n%\nOur provision for income taxes for fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2024 income. We also recognized tax benefits of $42.9 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the period. \nDuring fiscal 2024, we received best judgment tax audit assessments of approximately $26.0 million from the Israel Tax Authority (“ITA”) for the tax years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The best judgment tax audit assessments were primarily related to transfer pricing and withholding taxes. We disagree with the ITA’s positions and have appealed or are in the process of appealing the tax assessments.\nIn 2021, the OECD announced Pillar Two Model Rules which call for the taxation of large multinational corporations, such as Cadence, at a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, including Ireland and Hungary, have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in fiscal 2024 or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. The currently enacted Pillar Two Model Rules did not have a material impact to our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2024.\nOur provision for income taxes for fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2023 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $54.0 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the period. We also recognized a tax benefit of $24.8 million due to the recognition of previously unrecognized federal tax benefits from the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and a tax benefit of $14.0 million primarily related to a change in R&D expenses that were capitalized in fiscal 2022. \n40\nTable of Contents\nOur future effective tax rates may also be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2025 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2025 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate.\n For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nAs of\nChange\n \nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,644.0 \n$\n1,008.2 \n$\n1,635.8 \nNet working capital\n2,646.0 \n385.4 \n2,260.6 \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2,644.0 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $1,008.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\nOur primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2024 were proceeds from debt, cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options exercised during the year and proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments.\nOur primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2024 were payments related to employee salaries and benefits, operating expenses, payments on debt, cash paid for acquired businesses, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, payments for income taxes, payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock and purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n Approximately 34% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings. We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions, investments and share repurchases, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nNet Working Capital\nNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. Our net working capital varies from period to period due to changes in operating assets and liabilities and the timing of investing and financing activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,260.6 \n$\n1,349.2 \n$\n(88.6)\nCash flows provided by operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers and the timing of cash disbursements for operating assets and liabilities.\n41\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows Used for Investing Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nCash used for investing activities\n$\n(837.1)\n$\n(412.2)\n$\n(424.9)\nCash used for investing activities increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to increased payments for business combinations and purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a decrease in cash used for investments in equity and debt securities. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, acquiring other companies and businesses, and making investments.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities\nCash flows provided by (used for) financing activities during fiscal 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n \n(In millions)\nCash provided by (used for) for financing activities\n$\n1,239.2 \n$\n(803.6)\n$\n2,042.8 \nCash from financing activities increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt, increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options exercised during the period, and a decrease in repurchases of common stock. These factors were partially offset by an increase in payments on debt and payments of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nSenior Notes\nIn September 2024, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.300% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700% Senior Notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes” and together with the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the “New Notes”). Interest on the New Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in March and September of each year, beginning in March 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the New Notes.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds of the New Notes issued in September 2024 to fully prepay the outstanding principal and accrued interest of our term loan facility due on September 7, 2025 (the “2025 Term Loan”) and our term loan facility due on May 20, 2026 (the “2026 Term Loan”). In October 2024, we also settled the outstanding principal of $350.0 million and accrued interest on the 4.375% Senior Notes that were due October 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) at maturity.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn August 2024, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility, dated June 30, 2021, and amended in September 2022, and entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “2024 Credit Facility”). The 2024 Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to $1.25 billion, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $500.0 million upon receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $1.75 billion. The 2024 Credit Facility expires on August 14, 2029. Any outstanding loans drawn under the 2024 Credit Facility are due at maturity on August 14, 2029, subject to an option to extend the maturity date. Outstanding borrowings may be repaid at any time prior to maturity. Interest rates associated with the 2024 Credit Facility are variable, so interest expense is impacted by changes in the interest rates, particularly for periods when there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Interest is payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with such credit facility.\nFor additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock under a publicly announced program that was most recently increased by our Board of Directors in August 2023. The actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. Our repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire a minimum amount of shares, does not have an expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated without prior notice. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $0.8 billion of the share repurchase authorization remained available to repurchase shares of our common stock. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information on share repurchases.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOther Liquidity Requirements\nA summary of other capital and liquidity requirements as of December 31, 2024, is as follows:\nTotal\nDue in Less\nThan 1 Year\n(In millions)\nOperating lease obligations\n(1)\n$\n173.6 \n$\n46.2 \nPurchase obligations\n78.3 \n58.9 \nContractual interest payments\n748.0 \n111.0 \nIncome tax payable\n40.4 \n40.4 \nOther long-term contractual obligations \n(2)\n94.5 \n— \nTotal\n$\n1,134.8 \n$\n256.5 \n_________________\n(1)\n Includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of December 31, 2024 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of December 31, 2024. \n(2)    \nIncluded in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $55.8 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.\nWe expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions, investments and share repurchases, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in revenue recognition, the accounting for income taxes and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or IP licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. These contracts require us to apply judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of our IP license arrangements and the license of certain software, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements, like the majority of our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. These time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”) for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the SSP.\n43\nTable of Contents\nRevenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. For our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. For our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.\nIf a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.\nWe are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations. \nWe only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.\nWe also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.\n44\nTable of Contents\nDuring fiscal 2024, we acquired intangible assets of $366.0 million, primarily through our acquisitions of BETA CAE and Invecas. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired was determined using variations of the income approach that utilizes unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements.\nFor existing technology, the fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. To estimate royalty savings over time, we projected revenue from the acquired existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology, including the effect of assumed technological obsolescence, before applying an assumed royalty rate. We assumed technological obsolescence at a rate of 10% annually, before applying an assumed royalty rate of 30% and a discount rate of 10%.\nFor agreements and relationships, the fair value was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Projected income from existing customer relationships was determined using customer retention rates between 85% and 92%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates between 10% and 14%.\nWe believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of our acquired intangible assets are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor additional information about the adoption of new accounting standards, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.",
