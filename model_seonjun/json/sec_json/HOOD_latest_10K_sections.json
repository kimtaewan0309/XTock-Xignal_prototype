  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nRobinhood was founded in 2013 on the belief that everyone should be welcome to participate in our financial system. We are creating a modern financial services platform for everyone, regardless of their wealth, income, or background. \nOur mission is to democratize finance for all. We use technology to provide access to the financial system in a way that is simple and convenient for our customers. We believe investing should be familiar and welcoming, with a simple design and an intuitive interface, so that customers are empowered to achieve their goals. We started with a revolutionary, bold brand and design in the Robinhood app which makes investing approachable for millions. Over the last decade, we have disrupted and changed the industry, becoming the first U.S. retail broker to offer commission-free stock trading with no account minimums, which was subsequently adopted by the rest of the industry. In recent years, we have continued to build relationships with our customers by introducing new products and diversifying our services that further expand access to the financial system, including focusing on products and tools for more seasoned investors. Through these efforts, we believe we have made investing culturally relevant and understandable, and that our platform is enabling our customers to become long-term investors and take greater control of their finances.\nAt Robinhood, our values are in service of our customers. The following values describe the company that we aspire to become:\n•\nSafety First. \nRobinhood is a safety first company. We create with care, make changes thoughtfully, and obsess over details. We don’t compromise regulatory requirements to move fast, and when we see something amiss, we move quickly to correct it. We take risks responsibly with safety as the foundation of innovation.\n•\nRadical Customer Focus\n. Customers are at the center of our company. We listen to them, design for their needs, and aim to make our user experience simple and intuitive. We put what’s best for customers at the center of decision-making. When there are customer pain points, we fix them quickly. \n•\nParticipation Is Power\n. We empower a new generation of investors. We seek to enable everyone to participate in the financial system and we deliver products to help them accomplish their long-term financial goals. We educate and empower our customers and strive to make the financial industry more inclusive. We were founded on the ideal that the rich shouldn’t get a better deal, so we treat people fairly and strive to deliver exceptional value.\n•\nOne Robinhood. \nWe’re all invested in the same mission. We earn the trust of our colleagues by being honest, inclusive, and transparent. We invite diverse perspectives, support each other, and engage in lively but kind debate in pursuit of our path forward. When decisions are made we move in unison with an ownership mentality. We hold ourselves accountable but never point the finger or evade responsibility, and we treat everyone with respect and grace.\n•\nHigh Performance.\n Our first instinct is to take action. We strive for improvement and push for progress; and when something is broken, we fix it. We are driven by impact and constantly go \n5\nTable of Contents\nafter big opportunities. We are making Robinhood a place people want to be by investing in our employees, leveraging diverse perspectives, and rewarding top performance. \n•\nFirst-Principles Thinking\n. We are inventors, dreamers, and problem solvers. We question assumptions and seek creative solutions rather than just following the crowd. We use data and experiments to inform our decisions, but we also make bold bets, challenge the status quo, and are often a first mover. And ultimately, we bravely do what’s right even when it’s scary and hasn’t been done before.\n•\nLean and Disciplined. \nWe do more with less. We pursue operational excellence so that we can deliver exceptional value to customers. We set ambitious goals, monitor progress, and regularly benchmark our performance to increase efficiency and effectiveness. We are respectful of each other’s time, so when we change course we do so intentionally after weighing the tradeoffs. \nOur Products And Features\nWe understand that millions of our customers have used Robinhood to enter the financial markets for the first time, and we take our responsibility to them seriously. We are passionate about operating Robinhood in a way that aligns with customer interests, applicable regulations, and with our own mission to democratize finance for all. We continue to create an ecosystem of financial products and services that will enable people across the world to become investors. We believe our products can transform the relationship people have with the financial system and that the products on our roadmap will go a long way toward making that a reality.\n We began by offering our customers the ability to buy and sell equities on a mobile-first platform and have since continued to expand our offerings to add new asset classes, products and features, while also growing internationally to better serve our customers. We designed our mobile platform to be an elegant, intuitive investing interface that provides our customers with trading functionality and market information such as historical prices, valuation multiples, recent news, analyst ratings, advanced charts, and more, at no additional cost. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we introduced Robinhood Legend. Built specifically for active traders, Robinhood Legend is a new powerful, sleek browser-based desktop trading platform that is fully customizable and available at no additional cost to anyone with a Robinhood account. We are in the process of scaling Robinhood Legend to all supported asset classes and capabilities, with the goal of making it the most state-of-the-art desktop platform for trading. \nEach capability we have added has been the result of a continuous focus on our customers’ needs and feedback, which has guided our product development decisions throughout our history.\nThe core tenet of the Robinhood offering—expanding access to our financial system through products that empower people to learn, participate, and grow—underpins each of our offerings. We remain focused on building the best products and ultimately aim to serve all of our customers’ financial needs. \nBrokerage\nUnited States\n•\nInvesting\n. Our platforms allow our customers to invest commission-free in U.S.-listed stocks and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), as well as related options and American Depository Receipts (“ADR”). \n•\nOptions Trading.\n We review eligibility for our customers who wish to trade options, including disclosure of investment experience and knowledge, investment objectives and financial information. Subject to approval from Robinhood, customers can access basic options strategies (Level 2), which permits buying calls and puts and selling covered calls and puts, or more advanced options strategies (Level 3), which permits fixed-risk spreads (such as credit spreads \n6\nTable of Contents\nand iron condors) and other advanced trading strategies, depending on their individually disclosed preparedness. We conduct regular reviews of our customers’ eligibility and take action to revoke access to trading options as appropriate, to ensure our customers are accessing the level of options strategies that are appropriate for them based on information such as their trading experience, investment objectives and financial situation. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced index option trading and made it available to all customers in January 2025. Index option trading allows our customers to trade options on diversified indices like the S&P 500 and VIX, while gaining access to potential tax benefits and one of the lowest contract fees among leading brokerages. \n•\nFractional Trading\n. Fractional trading allows customers to invest in fractions of a share of stock, rather than requiring them to buy and sell whole shares. This service enables customers to build a diversified portfolio regardless of their budget and removes a barrier to investing in higher-priced stocks, thereby providing access to a much greater selection of equities with as little as $1. \n•\nRecurring Investments.\n Our recurring investment feature enables our customers to automatically buy shares of equities and certain ETFs on a set schedule, allowing them to build positions over time and establish regular investing habits, even with small contributions. Our customers can also elect to automatically reinvest dividend income back into the underlying respective shares.\n•\nAccess to Investing on Margin. \nSubject to approval upon meeting eligibility criteria set by Robinhood, customers can invest on margin. This allows eligible customers to borrow a limited amount of funds from Robinhood to use as additional investing capital. Robinhood decides whether to extend margin to each customer who applies for access based on information regarding customer activity, portfolio equity or net worth criteria, investment objectives, and investing experience reported by the customer. In 2024, we began to offer an industry-leading tiered margin structure where customers now receive a single low interest rate based on their total margin balance, replacing the floating interest rate that was offered previously. \n•\nFully-Paid Securities Lending.\n Under our Fully-Paid Securities Lending program (“Fully-Paid Securities Lending”), a customer can earn passive income on their stock portfolio once they give Robinhood permission to lend out any fully paid stocks in their portfolio. Robinhood does the work of finding interested borrowers and customers get paid a share of the interest revenue earned when their shares have been loaned to borrowers. \n•\nCash Sweep\n. Our cash sweep program (“Cash Sweep”) provides additional value to our brokerage customers by allowing them to earn interest on uninvested brokerage cash swept to our partner banks. The interest compounds daily and is then paid out by the partner banks monthly, with customers able to track how much they’ve earned directly within the app. Cash deposited at these banks is eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance. \n•\nInstant Withdrawals\n. Our instant withdrawals feature enables eligible customers to withdraw money from their Robinhood accounts and instantly deposit it to their bank accounts or debit cards with a fee. \n•\nRobinhood Retirement. \nWe are making it easy and accessible to start saving for retirement through a traditional Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”) or Roth IRA and are expanding options for the growing population of freelance and gig workers without access to employer-based matching programs. Customers’ eligible contributions to their retirement account can earn a percentage match by Robinhood, subject to a five-year holding period. We offer customer IRA instant deposits up to $1,000, which allows customers to immediately start investing. Customers can also get a custom recommended portfolio, build their own, or do both, all commission-free. \n7\nTable of Contents\n•\n24 Hour Market\n. We were the first U.S. broker to offer around-the-clock trading of individual stocks, 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. We also offer around-the-clock trading of ETFs. It allows our customers to better manage their risk and take advantage of opportunities, no matter what time of day they arise. \n•\nJoint Investing Accounts. \nOur joint investing accounts allow customers to seamlessly manage investments with their partner while keeping their shared assets in one place. The joint account provides shared access for account holders that allows them to combine funds and increase their investment power as they work towards their financial goals. Gold Subscribers can also extend certain Robinhood Gold benefits to a joint account at no additional cost.\n•\nEvent Contracts. \nAn event contract is a type of financial derivative that allows traders to speculate on the outcome of a specific event. These contracts are generally structured around “Yes” or “No” outcomes, and fluctuate in price based on the projected outcome of the event. Event contracts then pay out if the position held matches the correct outcome of the event; otherwise, they expire with no value. Event contracts are offered through our Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”) license regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). During the fourth quarter of 2024, we were one of the only companies offering presidential election event contracts for the U.S. presidential election, which allowed customers to trade based on their prediction for which candidate would win the election. We believe event contracts give people a tool to engage in real-time decision-making, unlocking a new asset class. Following the success of our presidential election market, we plan to launch a more comprehensive event contract product in response to customer demand. \n•\nFutures.\n A futures contract is a legal agreement between two parties to buy or sell a set amount of an asset at an agreed-upon future date with the price set today. We started to make futures trading available to customers beginning January 2025 and expect full availability to all customers in the first quarter of 2025. Our futures trading allows customers to trade stock indexes, energy, currency, metals, and crypto at the speed of a tap with our sleek new trading ladder, while gaining access to potential tax benefits and one of the lowest commissions rates among leading competitors. In addition, our futures trading has no pattern day trading rules.\nUnited Kingdom\n•\nIn 2024, we began to offer most of our brokerage services to customers in the U.K. through Robinhood U.K. Ltd (“RHUK”), using a separate mobile application that is only available to eligible users in the U.K. Brokerage services available to our U.K. customers include commission-free trading on U.S.-listed stocks and ADR, option trading, fractional share trading, recurring investments, investing on margin, Fully-Paid Securities Lending, Cash Sweep, and 24 Hour Market. We plan to continue expanding our U.K. brokerage product offering in 2025. \n8\nTable of Contents\nRobinhood Crypto\nUnited States\nWe offer cryptocurrency trading in the United States through Robinhood Crypto, LLC (“RHC”). \nWe have expanded our coverage to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, achieving full coverage across all U.S. states and the largest territories. Customers trading \nin the Robinhood app can choose to have orders routed to non-exchange liquidity providers (“market makers”) commission-free or through exchange liquidity providers (“partner exchanges”) via smart exchange routing for a fee. Orders placed on Robinhood Legend are all routed to the partner exchanges via smart exchange routing. \nWe currently support trading in the following 22 cryptocurrencies, where available\n(1)\n:\nAave (AAVE)\nAvalanche (AVAX)\nBitcoin (BTC)\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\nBONK (BONK)\nCardano (ADA)\nChainlink (LINK)\nCompound (COMP)\nDogecoin (DOGE)\nDogwifhat (WIF)\nEthereum (ETH)\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\nLitecoin (LTC)\nPepecoin (PEPE)\nOFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP)*\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\nSolana (SOL)\nStellar Lumens (XLM)\nTezos (XTZ)\nUniswap (UNI)\nUSD Stablecoin (USDC)**\nXRP (XRP)\n_______________\n(1)\n \nNot all cryptocurrencies are available in every state. An asterisk indicates a cryptocurrency is not currently available for trading in New York; a double asterisk indicates a cryptocurrency is not currently available for trading in New York or Texas. \nWe also offer commission-free crypto recurring investments, allowing customers to automatically buy crypto on a schedule of their choice. This feature allows customers to build positions in their favorite cryptocurrencies over time. As an agent, we route all cryptocurrency transactions initiated by customers to third-party market makers or \nexchange liquidity providers\n. We never act as a counterparty to our users’ buy or sell transactions. We offer cryptocurrency transfers (“Crypto Transfers”), allowing customers to transfer cryptocurrency into and out of their RHC accounts without commission, where eligible. Additionally, we provide real-time market data for certain cryptocurrencies, including those that are not supported on RHC’s platform, for informational purposes only. \nWith Robinhood Connect, a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp tool that developers can embed directly into their decentralized applications, customers can fund Web3 wallets without the need to leave decentralized applications, or dApps. This avenue also benefits developers by being able to quickly embed the feature directly into their dApps, allowing their customers to use Robinhood Crypto to buy and transfer crypto, and fund their self-custody wallets.\nWe also launched the Robinhood Crypto Trading API to our most seasoned crypto traders, which can be used to set up advanced and automated trading strategies that allow them to stay ahead of market trends, react to significant market movements, or simply trade crypto–all without needing to open the Robinhood app.\nEuropean Union\nWe offer cryptocurrency trading in select jurisdictions within the European Union (the “EU”) through Robinhood Europe, UAB (“RHEU”) using a separate mobile application that is only available to eligible users in the EU. Eligible users in select jurisdictions in the EU can currently buy, sell, and hold select cryptocurrencies through RHEU. We charge users a commission each time a user decides to buy or sell certain cryptocurrencies in the EU. The list of cryptocurrencies supported by RHEU for eligible users in select jurisdictions in the EU is available on our website at https://robinhood.com/eu/en/support/articles/about-robinhood-crypto/\n.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe offer staking exclusively for EU customers on selected cryptocurrencies. Staking allows customers to earn rewards by locking up the cryptocurrencies, subject to the network and cryptocurrency’s requirements and bonding periods. In 2024, we also made Crypto Transfers available in the EU, giving EU customers greater flexibility and control over their digital assets. \nCustody\nWe hold all settled cryptocurrencies in custody on behalf of customers in two types of wallets: (i) hot wallets, which are managed online, and (ii) offline cold wallets, which require physical access controls. Our wallets store and transfer all the settled digital assets listed above using an architecture combining multi-party computation and hardware security to eliminate a single point of failure. We do not utilize third-party custodians for settled cryptocurrencies, but we do integrate proprietary technology from a third-party industry-standard vendor into the systems we use to support the custody, transfer and settlement operations to our wallets. In general, the overwhelming majority of cryptocurrency coins on our platforms are held in cold storage, in facilities located in the United States and in the EU with physical security systems that we believe are state-of-the-art, though some coins are held in hot wallets to support day-to-day operations. \nWe maintain custody of our customers’ cryptocurrencies in omnibus wallets on behalf and for the benefit of our customers. Following the purchase of cryptocurrencies from liquidity providers, cryptocurrencies are delivered to the secure omnibus wallet, or in the case of a net sell, cryptocurrencies are moved from such wallet to the liquidity provider’s account. We have implemented strict operational protocols and permissions for cryptocurrency movement with our internal operational team to restrict access to customer wallets, and tightly control the movement of cryptocurrencies. More than one person is required to initiate and approve each large transfer, and only a small group of higher-level employees have the necessary privileges to add and authorize new addresses or to release proceeds from wallets. Access to cryptocurrency transfer interfaces is strictly controlled and requires hardware two-factor authentication to log in. To help ensure our security system functions as designed, our systems undergo security audits and are regularly subject to penetration testing. \nWe maintain a ledger of customers’ ownership and account balances of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the Company’s accounting and crypto operations team has established internal control procedures and maintains records to verify the total quantity of each cryptocurrency we custody for our customers that are held in the omnibus wallets. Such controls are periodically tested by the Company’s internal financial compliance team.\nWe currently do not hold significant amounts of cryptocurrency for our own account. The small amounts of cryptocurrency assets we currently hold are purchased to solely support our business operations, and we do not commingle cryptocurrencies with those of our users. We do not engage in lending transactions with cryptocurrencies held on behalf of customers. We do not seek to profit from proprietary trading and only facilitate customer transactions. In addition, we have anti-money laundering and insider trading programs intended in part to prevent self-dealing and other potential conflicts of interest, including with respect to our cryptocurrency services.\nRobinhood Wallet\nSeparately from RHC and RHEU, Robinhood offers a self-custody, web3 wallet (the “Robinhood Wallet”) in over 150 countries through our Cayman Islands subsidiary, Robinhood Non-Custodial Ltd., that allows customers to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies to and from their wallets. Customers can store and manage cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Base networks. The Robinhood Wallet gives customers full control over their cryptocurrencies, which means they hold and maintain the private key to their assets, and does not collect any portion of network or “gas” fees imposed by the applicable network. The Robinhood Wallet is a software application that users must access via a separate application. Neither RHC nor RHEU custody any Robinhood Wallet assets.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRobinhood Gold\nOur subscription service grants subscribers access to a number of premium features. After an initial 30-day free trial, subscribers pay a flat recurring rate. Our premium features offered to Gold subscribers include:\n•\nHigher Interest on Cash Sweep.\n Subscribers can earn a higher interest rate on the cash swept to participating banks compared to users who do not subscribe to Gold. \n•\nHigher Match on IRA Contribution. \nSubscribers can earn a higher percentage match of 3% on eligible contributions compared to users who do not subscribe to Gold. \n•\nBigger Instant Deposits. \nSubscribers can immediately access $5,000 to $50,000 of their deposit, depending on their brokerage account balance and status, instantly so they can invest that portion of their deposit right away.\n•\nAccess to Investing on Margin\n. No interest is charged on the first $1,000 in margin borrowed by each Robinhood Gold subscriber.\n•\nLower Contract Fees or Commissions.\n Subscribers can trade index options at a lower contract fee or futures with lower commissions charged compared to customers who do not subscribe to Gold. \n•\nProfessional Research.\n Subscribers have unlimited access to in-depth stock research reports provided by Morningstar.\n•\nAdvanced Market Data.\n Subscribers have the ability to see greater depth of orders for any given stock or option with Level II Market Data from Nasdaq. The ability to see multiple buy and sell requests helps subscribers understand the availability or desire for a stock at a certain price.\nRobinhood Gold Card\nRobinhood Gold Card is offered under a program agreement (“Program Agreement”) between Robinhood Credit, Inc. (“Robinhood Credit”) and Coastal Community Bank (“Coastal Bank”), a member of the FDIC. There are no annual fees, and no foreign transaction fees. Robinhood Gold Card is exclusively for qualified Gold Subscribers and offers rewards on each eligible purchase, which are redeemable for travel, gift cards, and shopping, or can be instantly transferred to a Robinhood Gold Card user's brokerage account to invest, earn interest, or withdraw. Robinhood Gold Card users can manage their card activities via a separate mobile application, the Robinhood Credit Card app. We continue to roll out Robinhood Gold Card, now in the hands of nearly [100 thousand] customers.\nEducation \nWe believe that offering educational resources is critical to advancing our mission. The more financial education people receive, the better equipped, and thus more empowered they will be to make personal investment decisions that meet their long-term goals. We’ve been expanding financial educational resources on the Robinhood Learn website for anyone to access as well as in-app education for our customers. \nWe offer a variety of ways for our customers to grow their financial knowledge: \n•\nRobinhood Learn\n. Robinhood Learn is an online collection of guides, feature tutorials, and an extensive financial dictionary available to anyone. It is designed to provide people with a breadth of financial education and is regularly updated to ensure we provide timely and relevant information for anyone to learn and grow.\n11\nTable of Contents\n•\nIn-App Education\n. Our in-app education resources cover investing fundamentals including why people invest, a stock market overview, and tips on how to define investing goals. This allows customers to understand the basics of investing before their first trade. We plan to continue to release additional Learn modules to provide customers access to information that can help build financial confidence. \n•\nNewsfeeds\n. Our newsfeeds give customers access to free, premium news from sites such as Barron’s, Reuters and Dow Jones.\n•\nSherwood Snacks\n. Sherwood Snacks is an accessible digest of business news stories written for a new generation of investors. Its bite-sized news stories bring new investors the latest market-moving news without all of the complicated financial jargon. Building on the success of Robinhood Snacks, we formed Sherwood Media, LLC (“Sherwood Media”), a subsidiary that is the home for news and information about the markets, economics, business, technology, and the culture of money. We offer a suite of new editorial offerings, complementing Robinhood Snacks with more always-on news updates and analysis, original reporting and new newsletter offerings.\n•\nCrypto Learn and Earn\n. Our exclusive in-app educational module available to all RHC and eligible RHEU and Robinhood Wallet customers via Robinhood Learn that educates customers on the basics about cryptocurrency. Customers who complete these courses will be eligible to receive rewards, which will be paid out in cryptocurrency.\nOur Technology\nThe Robinhood apps and Robinhood Legend are the core front-end pathways through which our customers engage with us. Our self-clearing system, order routing system, data platform, and other back-end infrastructure deliver the capabilities that allow our customers to focus on investing, saving and spending, while also enabling us to rapidly develop products that our customers love to use. \nSome of our most critical technologies include:\n•\nCore Infrastructure and Data Platform.\n Our core infrastructure and data platform are all built on Amazon Web Services, and our platform enables application developers to define their microservices in a simple, standardized manner while also providing built-in scalability and resiliency. \n•\nSelf-Clearing System.\n Our self-clearing services allow us to clear and settle trades across stocks, ETFs, and options without relying on a third-party clearing firm, an approach that provides increased internal visibility and stronger oversight and control over clearing and settlement functions. \n•\nOrder Routing System.\n We built a proprietary order routing system that uses statistical models to evaluate past orders and execution quality data, and automatically routes customer orders to the market makers that have historically given customers the best prices. This competition-based system creates an incentive for market makers to provide better prices for our customers, in order to receive more orders in the future. We are committed to seeking a quality execution on every order, and our routing protocols are designed with this in mind. \n•\nMachine Learning Platform and Artificial Intelligence.\n We currently use machine learning and AI to improve our products and processes in certain circumstances. Our machine learning models and AI contribute to multiple capabilities across our business. For example, we use machine learning and AI to increase the efficiency of our in-app chat support, customer support workflows, fraud detection systems, and even to improve the customer experience in our newsfeed by expanding the number of sources we can pull from, parsing and categorizing these articles, and \n12\nTable of Contents\ndelivering highly relevant and varied news to our customers for companies, stocks, or cryptocurrencies. \n•\nExperiments Infrastructure.\n To enable our rapid product development cycle, we’ve built a proprietary experiments infrastructure that enables us to test product changes through the build process and validate research hypotheses. The iterative, customer-centric product development approach that is so core to our success is enabled by this robust internal technology.\nLooking ahead, we believe we are strategically positioned at the center of two major platform shifts—AI and cryptocurrency and blockchain technology—which have the potential to transform the industry. \n•\nArtificial Intelligence\n. We currently expect our adoption of AI to occur in three phases: by augmenting internal operations, by enhancing customer-facing products, and by developing sophisticated autonomous financial agents. We have successfully created operational efficiencies and brought in top-tier AI talent, including experts from leading frontier AI labs, to accelerate our advancements in AI. Additionally, we have begun to incorporate early applications of generative AI into our product offerings, such as within our customer service flows. As a technology company, we believe we are able to rapidly adopt new tools on the way to building complex AI agents and expect to introduce significantly more in the coming year, including our first AI-native advisory products.\n•\nCryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology\n. We believe cryptocurrency and blockchain technology will fundamentally transform financial infrastructure by offering significant efficiencies as the blockchain reduces the need for traditional financial intermediaries, such as clearing houses, transfer agents, and payment processors, leading to lower operational costs. We anticipate that cryptocurrency will increasingly integrate with the traditional financial system, ultimately serving as the new infrastructure for financial services. We expect that this will be driven by tokenization, which enables efficiency gains by moving traditional financial assets onto blockchain. We believe our leadership in crypto trading will position us to lead in this space and expect to continue launching new products and features that drive tokenization in the future.\nOur Customers\nWe are empowering a new generation of financial consumers. Robinhood was built to make the financial system more accessible and transparent for everyone. We have reached customers from a wide variety of social and economic backgrounds and many of our customers have told us that Robinhood was their first brokerage account. We take pride in the fact that we are expanding the market by welcoming new investors into the financial system and helping the next generation of investors build sound long-term investing, saving, and spending habits in their prime wealth building years. We are also laser focused on being the top platform for active traders who trade more actively and use more sophisticated products. \nCustomer feedback is at the heart of product development at Robinhood. We regularly communicate with our customers—not just to provide support, but also to learn more about their experiences and insights, and to respond to their feedback about our products. This keeps us connected with customers and enables us to understand their expectations, problems and opportunities they face financially. For example, in response to this customer feedback, we launched tax lots, an important feature designed to help customers manage their tax liabilities and give them flexibility when selling stocks. Further, in response to feedback from our active traders to have more tools to better track and manage their portfolio’s performance, both past and present, we also introduced the profit and loss chart, which enables our customers to see realized profit and loss information on all trades since January 1, 2024. These launches reflect our ongoing commitment to providing our customers with the insights and resources they need to make informed decisions and plan for the future.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOur Growth Strategies\nOur growth strategies are built around three key focus areas designed to meet increasing demand from our customers and further our mission of democratizing finance for all. We believe we are still in the early stages of this journey and remain committed to expanding access to financial services through innovative products.\nEstablishing Ourselves as the Number One Platform for Active Traders\nOur focus has been on systematically resolving issues that would lead an active trader to consider using another platform, with a particular emphasis on innovation and speed. We track our progress here by Notional Trading Volume (as defined in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report, “Glossary Terms”) market share. Our strategy for being number one in active traders is centered on three main priorities: \n•\nnew product innovations not yet available from all of our competitors such as our 24 Hour Market;\n•\nexpansion of asset classes such as index options, futures, and event contracts; and \n•\nimproving our tools, latency and charting to be best-in-class, particularly on Robinhood Legend. \nWith the launch of Robinhood Legend, along with a range of new capabilities and features that we have built and released, and plan to continue building and releasing in the future, we believe in our path to becoming the number one retail trading platform across all asset classes. \nBecoming the Number One in Wallet Share for the Next Generation \nMany of our customers are just beginning their financial journeys. As our next generation customers grow their wealth, we believe they will continue to expand their relationship with our platform, providing an increased opportunity to meet their growing financial needs. We believe that these needs may come in a number of forms, from helping new investors grow into long-term investors to providing other financial services such as saving, spending, or facilitating payments. We are committed to deepening strong relationships with our customers and we track our progress here by Robinhood Gold Subscribers and Net Deposits (each as defined in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report, “Key Performance Metrics”). Our strategy for being number one in wallet share for the next generation is centered on three main priorities: \n•\nbuild new products that cover the next generation’s remaining core financial needs, such as wealth management and advisory. We expect multigenerational advisory to be a big focus area in our future product roadmap, including via our pending acquisition of TradePMR (refer to Note 3 - Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for more information); \n•\ninnovate on incentives, particularly through Robinhood Gold, to provide our customers with greater value as their assets grow with us. Robinhood Gold has accelerated our growth in wallet share with our customers and we plan to continue expanding its coverage to include more of our products; and\n•\nreduce withdrawals and increase deposits by further streamlining the process for customers to onboard, deposit funds, and transfer assets into Robinhood.\nBuilding the Number One Global Financial Ecosystem \nWe believe there is a significant opportunity for Robinhood to grow internationally. We have leveraged our strengths as a technology and innovation leader in the U.S. and expanded our reach globally in the U.K. with brokerage services and in the EU with cryptocurrency trading. We have also taken our first steps in the business-to-business and institutional markets through our pending acquisitions of Bitstamp and TradePMR (Refer to Note 3 - Business Combinations to our consolidated \n14\nTable of Contents\nfinancial statements in this Annual Report for more information). Our strategy for building a global financial ecosystem is centered on three main priorities: \n•\nextend and adapt products that we have already built for U.S. consumers, such as our planned 2025 launch of options trading in the U.K.;\n•\nprioritize functionality that creates value for our customers across our platforms globally, and not just focusing on one individual market, such as multicurrency accounts and integration with foreign exchanges like the London Stock Exchange; and\n•\nintroduce market-specific functionality, such as individual saving accounts and self-invested personal pensions in the U.K.\nWe consider factors such as population size and demographics, legal and regulatory environments, general investing attitudes and the competitive landscape in potential new markets prior to pursuing such expansion. This drove our decision to open an office in Singapore as our APAC headquarters. Our plans to pursue international expansion are dependent on a variety of external factors, including, among other things, our obtaining required regulatory approvals, authorizations, licenses and consents, our obtaining and protecting intellectual property rights abroad, and the identification of, and successful entry into new business partnerships with third-party service providers that would be necessary to provide our products and services in the relevant local market.\nCompetition\nWe believe that we are changing the consumption patterns for financial products and services and growing the market, but will continue to face competition from other firms including large legacy financial institutions, large technology companies, and smaller, new financial technology entrants.\nWe believe that the key competitive factors in our market include:\n•\nproduct innovation, including features, quality, and functionality;\n•\noperating efficiency;\n•\nengineering talent;\n•\nbrand recognition;\n•\nsecurity and trust;\n•\ncloud-based architecture;\n•\nregulatory licenses; and\n•\nvertical integration.\nWe seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily through our vertically integrated mobile and desktop platforms, and focus on accessibility, customer experience, and trust. We believe that our ability to innovate quickly further differentiates our platforms from our competition. We believe we compete favorably across all key competitive factors and that we have developed a business model that is difficult to replicate.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOur Competitive Advantages\nWe believe we have a number of competitive advantages that position us well to serve an increasing portion of the population and the broader global financial ecosystem.\nCreative Product Design\nWe believe archaic, cumbersome digital platforms reinforce legacy barriers to participation in the financial system. We put design at the center of our product with the goal of building long-term relationships with customers. We involve our talented product designers early and often throughout our product development process to create intuitive and elegant experiences that efficiently address our customers’ needs. Our customer-centric approach has made our platform easy to use, informative, and familiar in look and feel for a generation of mobile-first customers. For example, we seamlessly integrate information into our platform through Robinhood Learn and our newsfeed, which offers free news from trusted sources including \nBarron’s\n, \nReuters,\n and \nDow Jones\n. In addition, we continue to work to deliver an intuitive product experience including developing and implementing designs to celebrate investing milestones of our customers in a responsible way. While many of our products are designed mobile-first, allowing us to offer attractive investing, spending, and saving experiences as more people shift their daily financial services activities to the palm of their hands, we have also introduced Robinhood Legend, which we are in the process of scaling to all supported asset classes and capabilities.\nCategory-Defining Brand \nWe believe Robinhood today is a symbol of retail investing and finance in America, and we are committed to expanding our reach globally. By taking a fresh, people-centric approach and creating a delightful, engaging customer experience, we believe we have built a trusted, category-defining brand that has made investing socially relevant for the next generation. \nThe relationship we have built with our customers has led many to want to talk about Robinhood and share their experience with their friends and family. We believe the excitement around Robinhood demonstrates how our innovative approach to financial products has built deep, loyal customer relationships and positioned us well to continue attracting new people to our platform, and sharing new product experiences with our customers.\nFinancial Services at Internet Scale\nOur people-centric approach has driven customer enthusiasm and engagement, resulting in rapid adoption of our products. We designed our platform to provide our customers with relevant, accessible information when they need it most. Being an investor involves following a regular cycle of events—news releases, earnings announcements, transaction executions—that creates a regular cadence of content and information. We use our platform, from push notifications to widgets, to provide seamless customized updates to our customers. This engenders trust, creates enduring long-term relationships, and has resonated with our customers.\nVertically Integrated Platform\nWe design our own products and services and deliver them through app-based and desktop platforms supported by proprietary technology that has been cloud-based from the start. We are a licensed introducing broker-dealer, a licensed clearing broker-dealer, a licensed money-transmitter, and a registered futures commission merchant. Our digitally-native technology stack also gives us control over our product development from end-to-end, enabling faster development times, better customer experiences, stronger unit economics, greater flexibility, and a robust and dynamic risk management framework. Our vertically integrated platform has enabled us to rapidly introduce new products and services such as index options, futures, and event contracts, while also supporting our ability to scale.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOperating Efficiency \nWe believe our operating efficiency and disciplined approach to managing fixed costs, along with our technology-first approach to product development and customer service, creates a cost advantage that allows us to competitively price our offerings while profitably serving our customers.\nSeasonality\nOur business can be subject to seasonal fluctuations due to such factors as retail interest in investing, overall number of market participants and trading volumes, varying numbers of trading days from quarter-to-quarter, declines in trading activity around holidays, and proxy and investor communications activity during proxy season. Seasonal trends may be superseded by market or macroeconomic events, which can have a significant impact on equity and cryptocurrency valuations and trading activity.\nHuman Capital\nOur Employees and Culture\nIn order to pursue our ambitious product roadmap we need to foster a great culture. At Robinhood, that means focusing our human capital strategy on building a high performance culture, building community, and investing in top talent. \nHigh Performance Culture\nWe design our talent programs to motivate, recognize, and reward high performance. We maintain a lean organizational structure to provide internal development opportunities, set clear goals, and assess performance based on impact. We support job-specific capabilities and training to help develop behavioral and leadership capabilities for all employees.\nTop Talent\nWe are dedicated to attracting and retaining the top talent in our industry. We prioritize hiring great leaders and industry talent with deep functional expertise, we set high standards for performance and we are committed to our employees’ professional and technical development so we can grow together as we transform the future of finance. \nWe work to attract the best talent from a range of backgrounds and experiences in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 2,300 full-time employees. \nCommunity\nRobinhood aims to build an inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and empowered to do their best work. We invest in high quality tools and resources for the employee experience, especially in our office locations. We also value the benefits of working in person and create office environments that foster collaboration and connection.\nWe also aim to support an inclusive community through ten Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that, as of December 31, 2024, engage about 60% of our employees: Asianhood, Black Excellence, Christianhood, Divergent, Latinhood, Parenthood, Rainbowhood, Sisterhood, Veterans at Robinhood, and Women in Tech.\nEmployee Incentives and Benefits\nWe offer highly competitive compensation for employees and benefits for themselves and their families. To help foster our high performance culture, all employees are eligible for variable incentive pay \n17\nTable of Contents\n(bonus and/or equity) and all of our compensation programs are directly linked to individual and/or company performance. Our comprehensive benefits are designed to attract the best talent and to ensure Robinhood employees are supported. Where applicable, eligibility also extends to domestic partners and their children; our approach aims to support the diverse needs of our employees. Some notable benefits that our employees value include fertility benefits, a flexible lifestyle wallet that can be used for wellness, education or a number of other benefits, generous paid family leave, retirement savings with employer match, and employer-paid health benefits.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and ability to compete are significantly dependent on our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and expertise, registered domain names, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, license agreements, and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, although we do not consider any individual piece of our intellectual property to be material to our business, taken as a whole. We seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brand, by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as on contractual measures. However, these laws, agreements, and procedures provide only limited protection. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and other third parties, and into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information, trade secrets, know-how, and proprietary technology. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single or group of patent(s), trademark(s), copyright(s), domain name(s), license(s), assignment agreement(s), or any other form of intellectual property.\nThough we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace. Any of our intellectual property rights might be successfully challenged, opposed, diluted, misappropriated, or circumvented by others or invalidated, narrowed in scope or held unenforceable through administrative process or litigation in the U.S. or in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secrets and intellectual property rights. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights might also be met with defenses, counterclaims, and counter-suits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights.\nWe have an ongoing trademark, service mark, and copyright registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and solution names, taglines, designs, and logos in the United States and certain other jurisdictions to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We are the registered owners of U.S. and international trademarks, trademark applications, and registrations and domain names in the U.S. and foreign countries that include the primary brand “Robinhood,” including variations thereof, as well as brands, tag lines, and other branding elements for other Robinhood products and services, such as our Snacks newsletter and media content. We also have common law rights in certain unregistered trademarks and copyrights that were established over years of use. Additionally, we have an ongoing patent registration program pursuant to which we register and acquire certain design and utility patents in the United States and certain other jurisdictions to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We are the authorized user of a variety of social media handles, pages, and profiles that reflect our primary brand. In addition, we have a suite of defensively registered domain names. We believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand, combating fraud, and maintaining goodwill. We believe the duration of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, and licenses is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and \n18\nTable of Contents\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our trademark rights and to determine the validity and scope of the trademark rights of others. \nDespite our efforts to obtain, maintain, protect, defend, and enforce our intellectual property rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who might use our technology or other proprietary information to develop services that compete with ours, and our intellectual property rights might not be respected in the future or might be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Although we do not consider any individual piece of our intellectual property to be material to our business, taken as a whole, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nRegulation\nU.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations apply to many key aspects of our current business operations and future business plans. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our growth or ability to continue to operate. For additional information relating to regulation and regulatory actions, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Cryptocurrency Products and Services.” \nBroker-Dealer Regulation \nAs broker-dealers, our subsidiaries Robinhood Securities, LLC (“RHS”) and Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”) are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and SROs, and are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities industry. Federal, state and SROs, including the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), can, and in some cases have in the past, among other things, investigate, censure or fine us, issue cease-and-desist orders or otherwise restrict our operations, require changes to our business practices, products or services, limit our marketing or acquisition activities or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. Similarly, state attorneys general and other state regulators, including state securities and financial services regulators, can bring and have in the past brought legal actions on behalf of the residents of their states to assure compliance with state laws. In addition, criminal authorities such as state attorneys general or the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) may institute civil or criminal proceedings against us for violating applicable laws, rules, or regulations. \nThe SEC and FINRA have stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by regulated entities. Generally, a broker-dealer’s capital is its net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for certain types of asset. Rule 15c3-1 (the “Net Capital Rule”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) specifies that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealer’s assets be maintained in a relatively liquid form. Changes to or expansion of the Net Capital Rule, or an unusually large charge against our broker-dealer’s net capital, could limit our operations. See “—Risks Related to Our Business—We might need additional capital to provide liquidity and support business growth and objectives, and this capital might not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, might result in stockholder dilution, or might be delayed or prohibited by applicable regulations.” A large charge or operating loss against our net capital could adversely impact our ability to maintain or expand current business, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. If one of our regulated entities fails to maintain its required net capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation of its registration by regulatory authorities and suspension or expulsion by these regulators could lead to the entity’s liquidation. \n19\nTable of Contents\nMoney-Transmitter Regulation \nAs money transmitters, our subsidiaries RHC and Robinhood Money, LLC (“RHY”) are subject to regulation, primarily at the state level. We are also subject to regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). We have obtained or are in the process of obtaining licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or as another type of regulated financial services institution, as applicable) in the United States and in the states and territories where this is required. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies concerning those aspects of our business considered money transmission. Evaluation of our compliance efforts, as well as the questions of whether and to what extent our products and services are considered money transmission, are matters of regulatory interpretation and could change over time. There are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing these licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines, other enforcement actions, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any such licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdictions. In certain markets, we might rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators might use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. The need to obtain or maintain these licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products, and services, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing\nWe are subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations in the United States, the U.K. and the EU. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”), broker-dealers and money transmitters are required to “know your customer” and to monitor their customers’ transactions for suspicious transactions. In the U.K., the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 is the primary regulation for all financial services in the U.K. This law designates the Financial Conduct Authority as the main AML regulator and provides guidelines for its duties. \nAs required by the USA Patriot Act and other rules, we have established comprehensive AML, customer identification and transaction surveillance designed to prevent our financial services from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity. Our program is also designed to prevent our products and services from being used to facilitate business in countries, or with persons or entities, included on designated government sanctions lists, including lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”), Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons lists, and equivalent foreign lists. Additionally, we have designed and implemented restrictions to prevent certain types of high-risk activity, including account opening fraud, and systems to identify potentially manipulative patterns of trading or higher risk patterns of money movements, and report such activities and transactions, where appropriate. Our AML compliance program includes policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls, including the designation of AML compliance officers. This program is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements, while managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. Anti-money laundering regulations are constantly evolving, thus we actively monitor our compliance with AML rules and regulations and industry standards, and continuously implement policies, procedures, and internal controls in light of current legal requirements.\nCryptocurrency Regulation\nAs noted above, in the U.S., states primarily regulate RHC as a money transmitter. RHC also is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The laws and regulations applicable to \n20\nTable of Contents\ncryptocurrency are evolving and subject to interpretation and change. Therefore, our current and future cryptocurrency services may be or become subject to additional licensing and regulatory requirements by other state and federal authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to grow or to continue to operate. \nData Privacy and Security\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and non-U.S. laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security. In the U.S., federal law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and its implementing regulations, restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices and provides individuals with some rights to prevent the use and disclosure of nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal data through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. The U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has also announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection, use, and other processing of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting some targeted advertising practices, and numerous states, including but not limited to California through the California Consumer Privacy Act, as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, have enacted or are in the process of enacting state-level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and other processing of state residents’ personal data. The New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) also issued Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, which took effect in 2017, and which require banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NYDFS including RHC, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State’s financial services industry. We are also subject to, or expect to be subject to, the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Operational Resilience Act, the ePrivacy Directive (including its national implementations), and other privacy, data security, and data protection laws and regulations in connection with our expansion into the U.K., the EU, and other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate.\nCommunications Regulation\nWe send texts, emails, and other communications in a variety of contexts, such as when providing digital transaction confirmations and marketing. Communications laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, apply to certain aspects of this activity in the United States and elsewhere.\nCredit Card Regulation\nRobinhood Credit is a financial technology company that offers customers access to credit cards and rewards program. Robinhood Credit is not a bank, and its credit card is issued by Coastal Bank, member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. Because of its role in offering customers access to a credit card, Robinhood Credit is subject to the jurisdiction of the CFPB. The CFPB has broad authority over Robinhood Credit’s business, including authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws such as the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions, such as Coastal Bank, for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. Robinhood Credit is subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the CFPB, as a facilitator, servicer or acquirer of consumer credit. As a vendor to Coastal Bank, Robinhood Credit is also subject to examination by federal banking regulators, such as the Federal Reserve Board, with respect to the marketing, customer screening and \n21\nTable of Contents\nservicing activities undertaken by Robinhood Credit on Coastal Bank’s behalf. In addition, Robinhood Credit may be considered to qualify as a “debt collector” and federal, state and local statutes establish specific guidelines and procedures which debt collectors must follow when collecting consumer receivables. The Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (“FDCPA”) and comparable state and local laws establish specific guidelines and procedures which debt collectors must follow when communicating with consumers, including the time, place and manner of the communications. Robinhood Credit has policies and procedures in place to comply with the applicable provisions of the TILA, ECOA, FDCPA and other applicable federal law and comparable regulations in all of its activities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulatory requirements applicable to Robinhood Credit’s business may, among other things, subject Robinhood Credit to damages, revocation of required licenses, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions, and civil and criminal liability, which may harm Robinhood Credit’s business and its ability to maintain its partnerships and product offerings.\nFinally, Robinhood Credit’s activities are subject to certain state licensing requirements. Because of its partnership with Coastal Bank for the issuance of credit card accounts, Robinhood Credit believes in most states it operates it is exempt from or satisfies relevant licensing requirements with respect to the origination of credit card accounts that Robinhood Credit facilitates. However, Robinhood Credit may need one or more state licenses to broker, acquire, service and/or enforce loans. As needed, Robinhood Credit has and will continue to endeavor to apply and obtain the appropriate licenses. Although Robinhood Credit will periodically evaluate the need for licensing in various jurisdictions, there is a risk that, at any given time, Robinhood Credit will not have the necessary licenses to operate in all relevant jurisdictions or that Robinhood Credit will not be in full compliance with all applicable requirements. If Robinhood Credit is found to not have complied with applicable laws, regulations or requirements in any jurisdiction, Robinhood Credit could lose one or more of its licenses, become subject to a consent order or administrative enforcement action, need to modify or suspend certain of its business practices (including limiting the maximum Annual Percentage Rates offered to credit card applicants), or be required to obtain a license in such jurisdiction, any of which may harm Robinhood Credit’s business.\nAuthorized Activities in the U.K.\nRHUK is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the U.K. to carry on certain regulated activities related to the provision of investment services. The FCA regulates the financial services industry in the U.K. Its role includes securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers, protecting and enhancing the integrity of the U.K. financial system, and promoting effective competition in the interest of consumers. If RHUK and/or its personnel fail to meet FCA standards, including, but not limited to, RHUK’s compliance with its obligations under Consumer Duty rules and guidelines, the FCA has a range of enforcement powers that it can use, including among other things, withdrawing a firm’s authorization, prohibiting and suspending firms and individuals from undertaking regulated activities, issuing fines, and bringing criminal prosecutions.\nCryptocurrency Regulation in the European Union\nRHEU offers cryptocurrency services to eligible customers in select jurisdictions in the EU and is registered according to the regulatory requirements of the Republic of Lithuania as a virtual currency exchange and virtual currency depository wallet operator. RHEU is supervised by the Lithuanian Financial Crime Investigation Service under the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Lithuania. RHEU is also registered under the applicable Polish, Italian, and Spanish laws as a virtual assets service provider in the Register of Virtual Currency Activities maintained by the Director of the Tax Administration Chamber in Poland, the Register of Bureaux de Change maintained by the Organismo Agenti e Mediatori in Italy, and the Registry of Providers of Virtual Currency Exchange Services for Fiat Currency and Custody of Electronic Wallets maintained by the Bank of Spain. RHEU is in the process of obtaining necessary authorizations and licenses to operate in other countries in the EU. RHEU also intends to expand its offerings. Failure to comply with applicable Lithuanian rules and regulations, and similar laws, rules and regulations in other EU countries could result in fines or other legal consequences for RHEU. In addition, EU-level legislation imposing additional regulatory requirements in relation to crypto-related activities is \n22\nTable of Contents\nalso expected to take effect in the near term, due to the adoption of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (“MiCA”). Among other provisions, MiCA introduces a comprehensive authorization and compliance regime for crypto asset service providers and a disclosure regime for the issuers of certain crypto assets, which is expected to impact our operations in the EU. \nFutures and Commodity Industry Regulations\nThe principal operations of our subsidiary Robinhood Derivatives, LLC (“RHD”) are to facilitate trading of futures contracts, event contracts, and options on futures contracts for our customers. RHD is registered with the CFTC as an FCM and is a member of the National Futures Association (the “NFA”). RHD is also a registered swap firm with the CFTC for trading cleared swaps. RHD is required to comply with a wide range of requirements imposed by the CFTC and the NFA. The commodity futures, commodity options, and the cleared swaps industries in the U.S. are subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. RHD is subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC. RHD is also subject to NFA regulation, including requirements pertaining to cybersecurity and supervision.\nThe CFTC has stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital required by regulated entities. RHD is subject to the CFTC’s minimum financial requirements under the CEA. Generally, a FCM’s capital is its net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for certain types of assets. See “—Risks Related to Our Brokerage Products and Services— Our exposure to credit risk with customers, market makers, and other counterparties could result in losses.” A large charge or operating loss against RHD’s net capital could adversely impact its ability to maintain or expand current business, which could have a material adverse impact on its business and financial condition. If RHD fails to maintain its required net capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation of its registration by regulatory authorities and suspension or expulsion by these regulators could lead to the entity’s liquidation. \nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Regulations\nWe are subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) in the U.S. and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (“the Bribery Act”), which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The Bribery Act also prohibits improper payments between private entities and persons. Additionally, the FCPA requires issuers to maintain accurate books and records and have a system of internal controls sufficient to, among other things, provide reasonable assurances that transactions are executed and assets are accessed and accounted for in accordance with management's authorization. \nThe sanctions for FCPA and Bribery Act violations can be significant. The SEC may bring civil enforcement actions against issuers and their officers, directors, employees, stockholders, and agents for violations of the anti-bribery or accounting provisions of the FCPA. Companies and individuals that have committed violations of the FCPA may have to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus pay prejudgment interest and substantial civil penalties. Companies may also be subject to oversight by an independent consultant. In the U.K., the Serious Fraud Office has also published various policies and internal guidance documents for investigators and prosecutors considering bribery offenses. The consequences for individuals and organizations found guilty of an offense under the Bribery Act can be serious. The maximum sentence is 10 years for individuals who commit such offenses. Organizations are liable for an unlimited fine; removal of tainted proceeds; debarment from public sector contracts/tenders, as well as the disruption and cost of a law enforcement investigation; and directors may be disqualified from acting as a director for up to fifteen years.\n23\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental Regulation \nWe are subject to applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to climate risk and environmental impact, including those required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, we are, or may become, subject to various climate disclosure regimes regulating the disclosure of green house gas (“GHG”) emissions and related information, such as the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Risk Act, and the SEC’s final rules under SEC Release No. 34-99678 and No. 33-11275 entitled “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.” The interpretation and enforcement of such climate disclosure regimes remains uncertain, and compliance may require the investment of significant resources, increase our costs, disrupt our business operations and pose reputational and other risks.\nAI Regulation \nAs we continue to expand into a global financial ecosystem, we are subject to laws, regulations, and industry standards that develop in response to the use of AI. The EU’s AI Act, which became effective on August 1, 2024, governs the development, marketing, and use of AI in the EU and could impose significant additional costs on us to comply or we may face significant fines for failing to comply. On a state level, in 2024 California enacted a range of laws regulating the use and development of AI, which generally relate to transparency, privacy and fairness, among other concerns, which may impact us. The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including with respect to intellectual property ownership and licensing rights, cybersecurity, and data protection laws.\nAvailable Information\nOn our investor relations website, investors.robinhood.com, we post the following filings after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Beneficial Ownership Reports on Forms 3, 4, and 5, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a), 15(d), or 16 of the Exchange Act.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section presents management’s perspective on our financial condition and results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess company performance. The following discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement data and information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes elsewhere in this Annual Report. It is also intended to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which might not be indicative of our future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”\nWe refer to our “users” and our “customers” interchangeably throughout this Annual Report to refer to individuals who hold accounts on our platforms. \nKey Performance Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. \n•\nFunded Customers: \nWe define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account. Individuals who share a funded joint investing account (which launched in July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded Customer.\n•\nAssets Under Custody (“AUC”)\n: We define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency, futures (including options on futures, swaps, and event contracts), and cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.\n•\nNet Deposits:\n We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash or assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and assets transferred off of our platforms for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash or assets earned in connection with Company promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold subscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was immaterial.\n89\nTable of Contents\n•\nAverage Revenue Per User (“ARPU”)\n: We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period.\n•\nGold Subscribers: \nWe define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.\nGlossary Terms\n•\nAutomated Customer Account Transfer Service (“ACATS”)\n: A system that automates and standardizes procedures for the transfer of assets in a customer account from one brokerage firm and/or bank to another.\n•\nCash Sweep\n: We define Cash Sweep as the period-end total amount of participating users’ uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically “swept” or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks. This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.\n•\nChurned Customers:\n A Funded Customer is considered “Churned” if it was ever a New Funded Customer whose account balance (measured as the fair value of assets in the account less any amount due from the user and excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) drops to or below zero and has not completed a transaction using any account with a Robinhood entity for at least 45 consecutive calendar days. Negative balances typically result from Fraudulent Deposit Transactions (which occur when users initiate deposits into their accounts, make trades on our platforms using a short-term extension of credit from us, and then repatriate or reverse the deposits, resulting in a loss to us of the credited amount) and unauthorized debit card use, and less often, from margin loans. \n•\nGrowth Rate with respect to Net Deposits:\n Growth rate is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12 month period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period.\n•\nInvestment Accounts:\n We define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account, a funded joint investing account, or a funded individual retirement account (“IRA”). As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, a Funded Customer can have up to four Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, joint investing account (which launched in July 2024), traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.\n•\nMargin Book:\n We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).\n•\nNew Funded Customers:\n We define a New Funded Customer as a unique person who became a Funded Customer for the first time during the relevant period. \n•\nNotional Trading Volume: \nWe define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time. \n90\nTable of Contents\n•\nOptions Contracts Traded:\n We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.\n•\nResurrected Customers:\n A Funded Customer is considered “Resurrected” in a stated period if it was a Churned Customer as of the end of the immediately preceding period and its balance (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) rises above zero or it completes a transaction using its account.\nOverview\nWith respect to the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:\n•\ntotal net revenues increased 58% to $2.95 billion compared to $1.87 billion;\n•\nnet income was $1.41 billion, or diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.56, compared to a net loss of $0.54 billion, or diluted EPS of -$0.61. Net income included the impact of:    \n◦\na $369 million deferred tax benefit, primarily from the release of the Company's valuation allowance on most of its net deferred tax assets;\n◦\na $55 million benefit due to a reversal of an accrual as part of a regulatory settlement.\n◦\nThe year ended December 31, 2023 included an expense of $485 million from the 2021 Founders Award Cancellation (the “2021 Founders Award Cancellation”);\n•\ntotal operating expenses decreased \n21% to\n $1.90 billion compared to $2.40 billion;\n◦\nSBC expense decreased \n65% to \n$304 million compared to $871 million;\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased 167% to $1.43 billion compared to \n$0.54 billion\n;\n•\nFunded Customers increased 8% to 25.2 million compared to 23.4 million and Investment Accounts increased by 10% to 26.2 million compared to 23.8 million;\n•\nAUC increased 88% to \n$192.9 billion\n compared to \n$102.6 billion, driven by continued Net Deposits and higher equity and cryptocurrency valuations;\n•\nNet Deposits were \n$50.5 billion, which \ntranslates to a growth rate of 49% relative to AUC at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to \n$17.1 billion, which translates to\n a growth rate of 27% relative to AUC at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022;\n•\nARPU increased 53% to\n $122\n compared to \n$80; and\n•\nGold Subscribers \nincreased 86% to 2.64 million compared to 1.42 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The purchase consideration is subject to customary purchase price adjustments. \nBoth pending acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and are expected to close in the first half of 2025.\nKey Performance Metrics\nKey performance metrics for the relevant periods were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2023\n2024\nFunded Customers\n(1) \n(in millions)\n23.0\n23.4\n25.2\nAUC\n(2)\n (in billions) \n$\n62.2\n$\n102.6\n$\n192.9\nNet Deposits\n (in billions)\n$\n18.4\n$\n17.1\n$\n50.5\nGrowth Rate with respect to Net Deposits\n19%\n27%\n49%\nARPU \n(in dollars)\n$\n60\n$\n80\n$\n122\nGold Subscribers\n (in millions)\n1.14\n1.42\n2.64\n_______________\n(1)\n The following table describes the annual changes within Funded Customers:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\nBeginning Funded Customers\n22.7 \n23.0 \n23.4 \nNew Funded Customers\n1.3 \n1.1 \n2.2 \nResurrected Customers\n0.2 \n0.2 \n0.5 \nChurned Customers\n(1.2)\n(0.9)\n(0.9)\nEnding Funded Customers\n23.0 \n23.4 \n25.2 \n92\nTable of Contents\n(2)\n The following table sets out the components of AUC by type of asset:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in billions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\nEquities\n$\n45.8 \n$\n69.4 \n$\n130.6 \nCryptocurrencies\n8.4 \n14.7 \n35.2 \nOptions and futures\n (2)\n0.3 \n0.6 \n1.8 \nCash held by Customers\n10.8 \n21.3 \n33.3 \nReceivables from Customers (primarily margin balances)\n(3.1)\n(3.4)\n(8.0)\nAUC\n$\n62.2 \n$\n102.6 \n$\n192.9 \n_______________\n(2) \nFutures consists of futures, options on futures, and swaps, including event contracts, which we launched during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe following table describes the changes within AUC:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in billions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\nBeginning AUC\n$\n98.0 \n$\n62.2 \n$\n102.6 \nNet Deposits\n18.4 \n17.1 \n50.5 \nNet market gains (losses)\n(54.2)\n23.3 \n39.8 \nEnding AUC\n$\n62.2 \n$\n102.6 \n$\n192.9 \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss), and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by \n93\nTable of Contents\nour management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting. \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss):\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(1,028)\n$\n(541)\n$\n1,411 \nAdd:\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities \n24 \n23 \n24 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n1 \n8 \n(347)\nDepreciation and amortization\n61 \n71 \n77 \nEBITDA (non-GAAP)\n(942)\n(439)\n1,165 \nAdd: SBC\n2021 Founders Award Cancellation\n— \n485 \n— \nSBC Excluding 2021 Founders Award Cancellation\n(1)\n654 \n386 \n304 \nSignificant legal and tax settlements and reserves\n(2)\n20 \n104 \n(40)\nRestructuring charges\n(3)\n105 \n— \n— \nQ4 2022 Processing Error\n(4)\n57 \n— \n— \nImpairment of Ziglu equity securities\n(5)\n12 \n— \n— \nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n$\n(94)\n$\n536 \n$\n1,429 \n_______________\n(1)\n For the year ended December 31, 2022, SBC excluding 2021 Founders Award Cancellation benefited from restructuring-related net reversals of previously recognized expense of $77 million in connection with both the April 2022 Restructuring and August 2022 Restructuring. \n(2) \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, significant legal and tax settlements and reserves included a $55 million benefit due to a reversal of an accrual as part of a regulatory settlement.\n(3)\n Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to both the April 2022 Restructuring and August 2022 Restructuring, consisting of $45 million of impairment and $9 million of accelerated depreciation, in each case relating to office closures, and $51 million of cash charges for employee-related wages, benefits and severance. Refer to Note 6 - Restructuring Activities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further information.\n(4) \nQ4 2022 Processing Error was due to delays in notification from third parties and process failures within Robinhood’s brokerage systems and operations in connection with the handling of a 1-for-25 reverse stock split transaction of Cosmos Health, Inc.\n(5)\n Partially as a result of the termination of the stock purchase agreement, the advances made to Ziglu accounted for as non-marketable equity securities were impaired to a carrying value of zero.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nTransaction-Based Revenues\nTransaction-based revenues consist of amounts earned from routing customer orders for options, cryptocurrencies, and equities to market makers. When customers place orders for options, cryptocurrencies, or equities on our platform, we route these orders to market makers and we receive consideration from those market makers. With respect to options and equities trading, such fees are known as PFOF. With respect to cryptocurrencies trading, we receive “Transaction Rebates” when routing to market makers. In the case of options, our fee is on a per contract basis based on the underlying security. For equities, the fees we receive are typically based on the size of the publicly quoted bid-ask spread for the security being traded; that is, we receive a fixed percentage of the difference between the publicly quoted bid and ask at the time the trade is executed. In the case of cryptocurrencies, our rebate is a fixed percentage of the notional order value.\nWithin each asset class, whether options, cryptocurrencies, or equities, the transaction-based revenue we earn is calculated in an identical manner among all participating market makers. We route \n94\nTable of Contents\noption and equity orders in priority to participating market makers that we believe are most likely to give our customers the best execution, based on historical performance (according to order price, trading symbol, availability of the market maker and, if statistically significant, order size), and, in the case of options, the likelihood of the order being filled is a factor as well. For cryptocurrency orders, we route to market makers based on price and availability of the cryptocurrency from the market maker. \nNet Interest Revenues \nNet interest revenues consist of interest revenues less interest expenses. We earn interest revenues on margin loans to users, segregated cash, cash equivalents, and securities, deposits with clearing organizations, corporate cash and investments, Cash Sweep, and carried customer credit card balances. We also earn and incur interest revenues and expenses on securities lending transactions. We incur interest expenses in connection with our revolving credit facilities and borrowings by the Credit Card Funding Trust. \nOther Revenues\nOther revenues primarily consists of Robinhood Gold subscription fees, proxy revenues, advertising revenues, and ACATS fees charged to users for facilitating the transfer of part or all of assets in their accounts to another broker-dealer.\nRobinhood Match Incentives\nWe offer a match incentive on customers’ eligible contributions to their retirement accounts and, from time to time, an incentive on other transfers of assets to our platform. All match incentives are recognized as a reduction to revenue when earned. The matches are allocated to certain revenue categories on a proportional basis.\nOperating Expenses\nBrokerage and Transaction\nBrokerage and transaction costs primarily consist of cash compensation and employee benefits, SBC, as well as allocated overhead for employees engaged in clearing and brokerage functions, market data expenses, \nexpenses related to our instant withdrawals feature, \nfees paid to centralized clearinghouses and regulatory fees, customer statement-related costs, and \nother brokerage and transaction costs such as costs related to our Cash Sweep and securities lending programs.\n A large portion of our brokerage and transaction costs are variable and tied to trading and transaction volumes on our platforms.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development costs primarily consist of costs incurred to support and improve our platforms and develop new products, costs associated with computer hardware and software, including amortization of internally developed software, and compensation and benefits, including SBC, for engineering, data science, and design personnel, as well as allocated overhead. \nOperations\nOperations costs consist of customer service related expenses, including cash compensation and employee benefits, SBC, as well as allocated overhead for employees engaged in customer support, and costs incurred to support and improve customer experience (such as third-party customer service vendors).\n95\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses consists of expected credit losses related to credit card and brokerage products. For credit card related, we have two types of provision for credit losses: i) one related to off-balance sheet credit card principal receivables, and ii) one related to on-balance sheet purchased credit card and interest receivables. Brokerage-related provision for credit losses primarily relates to unsecured balances of receivables from users due to Fraudulent Deposit Transactions and losses on margin lending.\nMarketing\nMarketing costs primarily consist of paid marketing channels such as digital marketing and brand marketing, as well as cash compensation, and employee benefits, SBC, and allocated overhead for employees engaged in the marketing function. \nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of cash compensation and employee benefits, SBC, as well as allocated overhead for certain executives and employees engaged in legal, finance, human resources, risk, and compliance. General and administrative costs also include legal expenses, other professional fees, business insurance, and real estate charges including impairments on our operating leases and leasehold improvements, lease terminations, and settlements and penalties.\n96\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations \nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations data:\n(in millions)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2023\n2024\nRevenues:\nTransaction-based revenues\n$\n814 \n$\n785 \n$\n1,647 \nNet interest revenues\n424 \n929 \n1,109 \nOther revenues\n120 \n151 \n195 \nTotal net revenues\n1,358 \n1,865 \n2,951 \nOperating expenses:\n(1)\nBrokerage and transaction \n179 \n146 \n164 \nTechnology and development\n878 \n805 \n818 \nOperations\n249 \n116 \n112 \nProvision for credit losses\n36 \n43 \n76 \nMarketing\n103 \n122 \n272 \nGeneral and administrative\n924 \n1,169 \n455 \nTotal operating expenses\n2,369 \n2,401 \n1,897 \nOther income (expense), net\n(16)\n3 \n10 \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(1,027)\n(533)\n1,064 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n1 \n8 \n(347)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(1,028)\n$\n(541)\n$\n1,411 \n____________________\n(1)\nIncludes SBC expense as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\nBrokerage and transaction \n$\n5 \n$\n7 \n$\n9 \nTechnology and development\n212 \n211 \n192 \nOperations\n8 \n8 \n7 \nMarketing\n4 \n5 \n8 \nGeneral and administrative\n425 \n640\n88\nTotal SBC expense\n$\n654 \n$\n871 \n$\n304 \n97\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nA discussion of our results for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. \nRevenues\nTransaction-Based Revenues\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except for percentages)\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2022 to 2023\n% Change\n2023 to 2024\n% Change\nTransaction-based revenues\nOptions\n$\n488\n$\n505\n$\n760\n3 \n%\n50 \n%\nCryptocurrencies\n202\n$\n135\n626\n(33)\n%\n364 \n%\nEquities\n117\n$\n104\n177\n(11)\n%\n70 \n%\nOther\n7\n$\n41\n84\n486 \n%\n105 \n%\nTotal transaction-based revenues\n$\n814\n$\n785\n$\n1,647\n(4)\n%\n110 \n%\nTransaction-based revenues as a % of total net revenues:\nOptions\n36%\n27%\n26%\nCryptocurrencies\n15%\n7%\n21%\nEquities\n9%\n6%\n6%\nOther\n—%\n2%\n3%\nTotal transaction-based revenues\n60 \n%\n42 \n%\n56 \n%\nTransaction-based revenues increased by $862 million primarily driven by increases of $491 million in cryptocurrencies, $255 million in options, and $73 million in equities. \nCryptocurrencies revenues increased as a result of a 77% increase in the average Notional Trading Volume traded per trader and a 72% increase in the number of users placing cryptocurrency trades. In addition, cryptocurrencies revenues benefited from a higher rebate rate from crypto market makers (a rebate increase was effective in May 2024). The increase was offset \nby $19 million of match incentives paid to our customers (Refer to \nNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for more information).\nO\nptions revenues increased due to a \n29%\n increase in the number of users placing option trades and a \n43%\n increase in Options Contracts Traded. \nIn addition, we experienced higher option rebate rates due to the mix of ticker symbols traded as different ticker symbols pay different rebate rates. \nThe increase was offset by $43 million of match incentives paid to our customers\n.\nEquities revenues increased as a result of a 45% increase in the average Notional Trading Volume traded per trader and a 23% increase in the number of users placing equity trades. The increase was partially offset by lower equity rebate rates due to the mix of ticker symbols traded as different ticker symbols pay different rebate rates. The increase was offset \nby $10 million of match incentives paid to our customers. \n98\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Revenues\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except for percentages)\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2022 to 2023\n% Change\n2023 to 2024\n% Change\nNet interest revenues:\nMargin interest\n$\n177\n$\n243\n$\n319\n37 \n%\n31 \n%\nInterest on segregated cash, cash equivalents, securities, and deposits\n57\n210\n261\n268 \n%\n24 \n%\nInterest on corporate cash and investments \n103\n288\n256\n180 \n%\n(11)\n%\nCash Sweep\n22\n123\n179\n459 \n%\n46 \n%\nSecurities lending, net\n89\n79\n94\n(11)\n%\n19 \n%\nCredit card, net\n—\n9\n24\nNM\n167 \n%\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities\n(24)\n(23)\n(24)\n(4)\n%\n4 \n%\nTotal net interest revenues\n$\n424\n$\n929\n$\n1,109\n119 \n%\n19 \n%\nNet interest revenues as a % of total net revenues:\nMargin interest\n13%\n13%\n11%\nInterest on corporate cash and investments \n7%\n16%\n9%\nInterest on segregated cash, cash equivalents, securities, and deposits\n4%\n11%\n9%\nCash Sweep\n2%\n7%\n6%\nSecurities lending, net\n7%\n4%\n3%\nCredit card, net\n—%\n—%\n1%\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities\n(2)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal net interest revenues\n31%\n50%\n38%\nNet interest revenues increased by $180 million, driven by growth in most of our interest-earning asset balances except for corporate cash and investments. Between September 2024 and the end of 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a total of 100 basis points, which negatively impacted our net interest revenues and adversely affected our customers returns on cash deposits. We anticipate any potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will have a similar impact.\n99\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes interest-earning assets, the revenue generated by these assets, and their respective annual yields:\n(in millions, except for annual yield)\nMargin Book\nCash and deposits\n(1)\nCash Sweep \n(off-balance sheet)\nCredit card, net \n(2)\nTotal interest-earning assets\nSecurities lending, net\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities \n(5)\nTotal net interest revenues\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n7,909\n$\n9,943\n$\n26,064\n$\n391\n$\n44,307\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n3,458\n10,107\n16,352\n205\n30,122\n \nAverage\n(3)\n5,082\n10,252\n21,352\n261\n36,947\n \nRevenue (expense)\n319\n517\n179\n24\n$\n1,039\n \n$\n94 \n$\n(24)\n$\n1,109\n \nAnnual yield\n(4)\n6.28 \n%\n5.04 \n%\n0.84 \n%\n9.20\n \n%\n2.81\n \n%\n3.00\n \n%\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n3,458\n$\n10,107\n$\n16,352\n205\n$\n30,122\n \nDecember 31, 2022\n3,089\n9,530\n5,837\nN/A\n18,456\n \nAverage\n(3)\n3,302\n9,979\n11,348\n197\n24,826\n \nRevenue (expense)\n243\n498\n123\n9\n$\n873\n \n$\n79 \n$\n(23)\n$\n929\n \nAnnual yield\n(4)\n7.36 \n%\n4.99 \n%\n1.08 \n%\nN/A\n3.52\n \n%\n3.74\n \n%\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n3,089\n$\n9,530\n$\n5,837\nN/A\n$\n18,456\n \nDecember 31, 2021\n6,467\n10,600\n2,095\nN/A\n19,162\n \nAverage\n(3)\n4,519\n9,931\n2,920\nN/A\n17,370\n \nRevenue (expense)\n177\n160\n22\nN/A\n$\n359\n \n$\n89 \n$\n(24)\n$\n424\n \nAnnual yield\n(4)\n3.92 \n%\n1.61 \n%\n0.75 \n%\nN/A\n2.07\n \n%\n2.44\n \n%\n_______________ \n(1)\n Includes cash and cash equivalents, cash, cash equivalents, and securities segregated under federal and other regulations, deposits with clearing organizations, and investments.\n(2) \nCredit card, net consists of i) an off-balance sheet amount representing customer principal amounts funded by Coastal Bank under the Program Agreement.

Other sources of future funds may include potential borrowing under our revolving lines of credit and potential issuance of new debt or equity. Our liquidity needs are primarily to support and invest in our core business, including investing in new ways to serve our customers, potentially seeking strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business, and for general capital needs (including capital requirements imposed by regulators and SROs and cash deposit and collateral requirements under the rules of the DTC, NSCC, OCC, and CFTC). Based on our current level of operations, we believe our primary sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current liquidity needs for the next 12 months.\n104\nTable of Contents\nLiquid Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.33 billion, held-to-maturity investments of $398 million, and stablecoin of $361 million.

The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and \n107\nTable of Contents\nsubjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, refer to Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results might differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe amount of the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of our financial assets measured at amortized cost considering available information from internal and external sources. The allowance for credit losses provides for unsecured balances of receivables from users due to Fraudulent Deposit Transactions, losses on margin lending, purchased credit card receivables, and reserves on proxy revenue receivables. The allowance for credit losses takes into account relevant available information including the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, and historical credit loss information. \nThe amount of the allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses from off-balance sheet credit exposure over the remaining expected life of credit card receivables originated under an arrangement with Coastal Bank. Coastal Bank is the legal lender and originator, the party to which the customer has a credit-borrower relationship, and the legal owner of the credit card receivables. We are responsible to pay Coastal Bank customer balances that are ultimately charged off or deemed uncollectible, generally when balances become outstanding for over 180 days. Allowance for credit losses takes into account information from internal and external sources and market data, which is estimated based on outstanding customer credit card principal balances owned by Coastal Bank and anticipated future customer payment rates based on past portfolio performance, both of which are unobservable inputs. The measurement of this liability using this method approximates fair value. For additional information, refer to Note 12 - Financing Activities and Off-Balance Sheet Risk to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customer contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results might differ from estimates. \nGoodwill \nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not \n108\nTable of Contents\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to a quantitative assessment.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nIncome Taxes\nWe make significant judgments and estimates to determine any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe that they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including, but not limited to, historical cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, tax planning strategies, and the carry-forward periods available for tax reporting purposes. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. We account for uncertain tax positions, including net interest and penalties, as a component of income tax expense or benefit. We make adjustments to these uncertain tax positions in accordance with applicable income tax guidance and based on changes in facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and operating results.\nShare-based Compensation\nMarket-Based RSUs\nWe have granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: time-based service conditions, performance-based conditions, and market-based conditions (“Market-Based RSUs”). The time-based service condition for these awards is generally satisfied over six years. The performance-based conditions were satisfied upon the occurrence of an IPO. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified share prices. \nFor market-based awards, we determined the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of an IPO, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimated the expected term based on various vesting scenarios, as these awards are not considered “plain vanilla.” We estimated the expected date of an IPO based on our expectation at the time of measurement of the award’s value.\nWe recorded SBC expense for market-based equity awards on an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions were considered probable to be satisfied. We determined the requisite service period by comparing the derived service period to \n109\nTable of Contents\nachieve the market-based condition and the explicit time-based service period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period. Remaining SBC related to the Market-Based RSUs was fully recorded over the remaining derived requisite service period by December 31, 2024. Previously recognized SBC related to the Market-Based RSUs will not be reversed even if the specified share prices are not achieved.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.",
