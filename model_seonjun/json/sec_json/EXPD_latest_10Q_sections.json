In addition, any statements that refer to projections of future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in the Company's businesses, signs of a slowing economy and drop in demand, future supply chain and transportation disruptions and other characterizations of disruptive events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with the impact of tariffs or other government actions on global trade volumes and economies, and tax audits and other contingencies that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These statements must be considered in connection with the discussion of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Attention should be given to the risk factors identified and discussed in Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2025 and in Part II, Item 1A in this report. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of this filing date and we do not assume any obligations to update these statements except as required by law.\nOverview\nExpeditors International of Washington, Inc. (herein referred to as \"Expeditors,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\") provides a full suite of global logistics services. Our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding, customs brokerage, warehousing and distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation, time-definite transportation services, temperature-controlled transit, cargo insurance, specialized cargo monitoring and tracking, and other supply chain solutions. We do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business. As a non-asset based carrier, we do not own or operate transportation assets.\nWe derive our revenues by entering into agreements that are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, which is that freight is shipped for and received by our customer. Each performance obligation is comprised of one or more of the Company's services. We typically satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered over time. A typical shipment would include services rendered at origin, such as pick-up and delivery to port, freight services from origin to destination port and destination services, such as customs clearance and final delivery. Our three principal services are the revenue categories presented in our financial statements: 1) airfreight services, 2) ocean freight and ocean services, and 3) customs brokerage and other services. The most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume, sell rates and buy rates. Volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenue.\nWe generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a volume basis from direct (asset-based) carriers and then reselling that space to our customers. The rate billed to our customers (the sell rate) is recognized as revenues and the rate we pay to the carrier (the buy rate) is recognized in operating expenses as the directly related cost of transportation and other expenses. By consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power, we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.\nIn most cases, we act as an indirect carrier. When acting as an indirect carrier, we issue a House Air Waybill (HAWB), a House Ocean Bill of Lading (HOBL) or a House Sea Waybill to customers as the contract of carriage. In turn, when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier, we receive a contract of carriage known as a Master Air Waybill for airfreight shipments and a Master Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean shipments.\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCustoms brokerage and other services involve providing services at destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation, calculating, and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and import services such as arranging for local pick up, storage and delivery at destination. These are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have offices. We also provide other value-added services at destination, such as warehousing and distribution, time-definitive transportation services and consulting.\nWe manage our company along geographic areas of responsibility: Americas; North Asia; South Asia; Europe; and Middle East, Africa and India (MAIR). Each area is divided into sub-regions that are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility. Our business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area. The nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units. Because of this inter-relationship between operating units, it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a stand-alone basis.\nOur operating units share revenue using the same arms-length pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents. Certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services, which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin. Our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability, which includes shared revenues and allocated costs. Therefore, individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network.\n \nThe mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions.\nSummary of Third Quarter 2025\nThe significant impacts are discussed within “Results of Operations” and summarized below.\n•\nRevenues declined 4% as a significant drop in ocean services was largely offset by growth in our other services.\n•\nRevenue from ocean freight and other services decreased 27% due to significant decreases in average ocean sell rates and buy rates and a 3% decline in ocean containers shipped. Demand for ocean services declined after U.S. importers accelerated shipments in anticipation of trade tariffs changes earlier in the year.\n•\nCustoms brokerage and other services and airfreight services revenues increased 13% and 3%, respectively.\n•\nGrowing complexity in customs brokerage due to the dynamic trade environment has resulted in high demand for our brokerage services resulting in growth in revenues from customs declarations fees, as well as increases in the resources to support that activity.\n•\nAirfreight services, road freight and warehousing and distribution services (included with customs brokerage and other services) all benefited from strong demand from our technology customers investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. \n•\nOperating income decreased 4% and net earnings to shareholders decreased 3%, as compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n•\nEarnings per share increased 1% to $1.64.\n•\nCash from operating activities was $201 million, up from $90 million in the third quarter of 2024. \n•\nWe returned $212 million to shareholders through common stock repurchases. \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIndustry Trends, Trade Conditions and Competition\nWe operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy. International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investment and taxation. Periodically, governments consider changes to tariffs, impose trade restrictions and accords. Currently, the United States Government has undertaken a substantial global trade rebalancing effort resulting in significantly higher tariffs on imports. Increased tariffs on certain sectors for Canada, China, and Mexico took effect in the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, reciprocal tariffs on certain countries were expected to take effect in April 2025, and were later postponed to July and August 2025, while trade negotiations by country were taking place. In the third quarter additional tariffs were imposed on imports from most countries including India, Brazil, and Japan. The United States has also imposed significantly higher tariffs on goods made in China. Additionally, sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum and their derivative products, as well as investigations were launched on other commodities since the second quarter of 2025. These measures have led to threatened or actual retaliatory tariffs and trade actions from several countries, including China and Canada. The \"de minimis\" exemption, which exempted goods made in China and Hong Kong of less than $800 in commercial value from tariffs and entry submission, was terminated on May 2, 2025, and expanded to all countries on August 29, 2025.  The potential for further tariff changes and trade restrictions remains high, creating an unpredictable environment for international trade. Changes in import and export regulations may further impact the flow of trade and the global economy. We cannot predict how changes in tariffs and trade restrictions will affect our business. As governments impose import and export restrictions, shippers may adjust their sourcing patterns on a temporary or longer-term basis and potentially shift manufacturing to other countries over time. Additionally, the constant changes in trade regulations since the beginning of 2025 are adding complexity to the customs declarations process, making compliance with regulations increasingly challenging.\n \nDoing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being influenced by governmental policies and inter-governmental disputes concerning international trade, our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the United States and other countries, as well as economic turbulence, political unrest and security concerns in the nations and on the trade shipping routes in which we conduct business. The future impact that these events may have on international trade, oil prices and security costs is uncertain. We do not have employees, assets, or operations in Russia, Ukraine, Israel, the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. While limited, any shipment activity is conducted with independent agents in those countries in compliance with all applicable trade sanctions, laws and regulations. We have a branch and employees in Lebanon but no significant assets.\nOur ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities, including airlines, ocean carrier lines and ground transportation providers, as well as governmental agencies. We select and engage with best-in-class, compliance-focused, efficiently run, growth-oriented partners, based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity. We consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. However, changes in the financial stability; operating capabilities, and the capacity of asset-based carriers; capacity allotments available from carriers; governmental regulation or deregulation efforts; modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage; and/or changes in governmental restrictions, quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways. When the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption, the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly. This carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact Expeditors' ability to maintain historical unitary profitability.\nThe global economic and trade environments remain highly uncertain; including inflation remaining higher than historical levels, volatility in oil prices, high interest rates and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2025, we saw high demand on exports out of Asia and continued to see high demand on exports out of South Asia in the second quarter 2025, resulting in high average sell and buy sell rates where demand exceeded carrier capacity. However, softening demand and additional available capacity for ocean freight resulted in declines in ocean sell and buy rates starting in the second quarter. Additional ocean and air transportation capacity will become available if demand softens due to uncertainty in economic and trade regulations and safe passage through the Red Sea resumes. These conditions could result in declines in average sell and buy rates. We also expect that pricing volatility will continue as carriers adapt to changes in demand, changing fuel prices, available capacity, security risks and react to governmental trade policies and other regulations. Additionally, we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that further changes in purchasing behavior, such as the evolution of international direct e-commerce platforms, could have on our business. Some customers are relocating manufacturing to other countries to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs on imports, reduce their supply chain risks, address disruptions caused by pandemics and geopolitical issues. These changes could negatively affect our business.\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal demand trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest; however, there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future or to what degree it will be impacted by an uncertain economy. This historical pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors, including weather patterns, national holidays, consumer demand, new product launches, just-in-time inventory models, economic conditions, pandemics, governmental policies, inter-governmental disputes and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces.\n \nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers in the retail and technology industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, as well as the scaling of AI infrastructure, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of our revenues is, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of our control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods, changes in trade tariffs, product launches, disruptions in supply chains and/or manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and, therefore, we may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter.\nTo the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our stock. We cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed on February 21, 2025 to the critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in that report.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following

services:\n \nAirfreight services revenues and expenses increased 3% and 4%, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared with the same period in 2024, due to a 4% increase in tonnage, partially offset by 2% and 1% decreases in average sell and buy rates, respectively. Airfreight services revenues and expenses both increased 10%, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared with the same period in 2024, due to a 6% increase in tonnage and 4% increases in both the average sell and buy rates, respectively.\n \nTonnage increased on exports from North Asia and South Asia during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared with the same periods in 2024, as a result of increased market demand, in part from technology customers investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nAverage sell and buy rates decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2025 on exports out of North Asia and South Asia. Imbalances between demand and capacity in 2024 and in the first half of 2025 eased in the third quarter of 2025, as additional capacity became available due to a drop in demand from direct e-commerce and fewer shippers accelerating orders in anticipation of higher tariffs. The elimination of the low-value de minimis exemption on shipments from China to the U.S. resulted in a decrease in demand for airfreight, allowing carriers to redistribute capacity to high demand routes, resulting in lower rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, average sell and buy rates increased in North Asia and Europe due to high demand in the first part of the year from shippers accelerating orders in anticipation of higher tariffs on U.S. imports.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeasonal changes in demand, impact from disruptions in the ocean market due to security concerns and variable demand for airfreight capacity from direct e-commerce business could cause volatility in average buy rates on certain routes. Additionally, geopolitical concerns, inter-governmental trade disputes, new tariffs on imports into the U.S. and retaliatory actions from other countries create uncertainty in the economy and the trade environment. As shippers and carriers react to these volatile conditions, it may negatively affect demand for airfreight services, which could significantly reduce our volumes and average sell and buy rates in the coming quarters. Though we are unable to predict how these uncertainties and any future disruptions may affect our operations or financial results prospectively, these conditions could result in significant decreases in our revenues and operating income.\n \nOcean freight and ocean services:\nOcean freight and ocean services consists of three basic services: ocean freight consolidation, order management and direct ocean forwarding. Ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expense decreased 27% and 31%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025  and 2% and 5%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared with the same periods in 2024. The largest component of our ocean freight and ocean services revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation, which represented 68% and 70% of ocean freight and ocean services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOcean freight consolidation revenues and expense decreased 35% and 38%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to 33% and 36% decreases in average sell and buy rates and a 3% decrease in containers shipped primarily from retail customers. Ocean freight consolidation revenues and expenses decreased 5% and 8%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to 8% and 11% decreases in average sell and buy rates, offset by a 4% increase in containers shipped. The declines in average buy rates and sell rates are due to a softening demand primarily on exports out of Asia and an increase in available carrier capacity. This decline could continue for the remainder of 2025 and beyond if demand softens and additional vessels are brought into service.\n \nNorth Asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues decreased 43% and 13%, respectively, and expenses decreased 46% and 16% driven by lower volumes and average rates. Containers shipped out of North Asia region decreased 12% and 3%, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025  while they increased for other regions. This was mainly due to customers relocating sourcing out of China to other regions and softening of the retail sector.\nSouth Asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses decreased 23% and 28%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, while they increased 10% and 7%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The decreases in the third quarter are due to declining average sell and buy rates compared to a strong first half of 2025 when customers front loaded shipments in anticipation of higher tariffs.\nOrder management revenues and expenses decreased 7%, and 9%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, while they both increased 7% respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024 due to loss of volumes in the third quarter, mainly in the North Asia region as customers slowed down ordering or shifted sourcing given the uncertainty of U.S. tariff changes.\n \nDirect ocean freight forwarding revenues increased 3% and 5%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and expenses increased 5% and 7% principally due to higher ancillary services in the United States and Europe.\nThe global economic and trade environment are increasingly uncertain and dynamic, with increases in trade tariffs and inter-governmental disputes. As shippers and carriers reacted to these volatile conditions, it negatively affected demand, which reduced our volumes and average sell and buy rates. Further, carriers have added new vessels which increased capacity and substantially decreased average sell and buy rates. While some volumes are shifting to other routes and as customers look to mitigate their exposure to U.S./China-specific tariffs, it is too early to know what the overall impact on volumes might be. If safe passage through the Red Sea resumes, additional capacity will become available due to shorter transit times. These conditions could further depress sell and buy rates and cause further decreases in our revenues and operating income.\n \nCustoms brokerage and other services:\nCustoms brokerage and other services revenues increased 13% and 12% and expenses increased 11% and 12% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared with the same periods in 2024. These changes are primarily due to increases in customs clearances, import services, road freight and warehousing and distribution from higher shipment volumes,\n \nprincipally from shipments into North America and Europe.\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNorth America revenues increased 13% and expenses increased 12% for both three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared with the same period in 2024. Europe revenues and expenses increased 19% and 20%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 13% and 16%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared with the same period in 2024.\nImport services, including charges at ports such as detention, drayage, terminal charges and delivery increased significantly in 2025 because of higher volumes in part from shippers front loading deliveries in anticipation of higher tariffs. Road freight and warehousing and distribution services benefited from high demand from our technology customers.\nCustomers value our brokerage services due to an increasingly dynamic and complex trade environment, and its impact on the declaration process. They seek knowledgeable customs brokers with sophisticated systems capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program that are necessary to rapidly respond to changes in the regulatory and security environment. Should international trade slow, lower volumes and pricing could significantly reduce our revenues and operating income.\nOverhead expenses:\nSalaries and related costs increased 9% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared with the same periods in 2024, principally due to a 7% increase in headcount, and increases in base salaries and benefits, partially offset by decreases in incentive compensation commensurate with lower operating income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 salaries and related costs increased 10%, principally due to a 7% increase in headcount and increases in base salaries and benefits. Headcount increased in 2025 compared to 2024, primarily in our operations and information technology. We hired employees in operations to support the added complexity and higher demand for customs brokerage services, primarily in North America, and support the growth in volumes transacted in certain services and regions such as South Asia, Europe and Latin America. We also continued to hire IT personnel to support essential investments which further strengthens our critical information systems.\n \nHistorically, the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and operating income has been the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual incentive compensation occur in proportion to changes in our operating income, creating an alignment between branch and corporate performance and shareholder interests.\n \nOur management compensation programs have always been incentive-based and performance driven. Total bonuses to field and executive management for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 10%, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher \noperating income.\n \nGenerally, no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is profitable. Any operating losses must be offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus. Executive management, in limited circumstances, makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level. Since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs, we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers. The outcome of any higher risk transactions, such as overriding established credit limits, would be known in a relatively short time frame. Management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of the short operating cycle of our services, the potential for short-term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking. Management believes that both the stability and the long-term growth in revenues, operating income and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programs.\nOther overhead expenses increased 14% and 16% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared with the same periods in 2024. This increase is primarily due to technology related expenses, increased consulting, and higher rental and occupancy expenses. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we incurred higher expenses related to indirect tax contingencies.\nWe expect to continue to enhance security and internal controls over our technology and systems and plan to deploy additional solutions which will result in increased expenses in the future. We will also continue to make important investments in people, processes and technology, as well as to invest in our strategic efforts to drive organic growth.\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome tax expense:\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate was 25.2% and 26.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 26.4% in both comparable periods of 2024.  The decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2025 was principally from an increase in Foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deductions. All periods benefited from U.S. income tax deductions for FDII as well as available U.S. Federal foreign tax credits principally from withholding taxes related to our foreign operations. We have not incurred any significant expenses for any period presented for either the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax, nor for the global minimum tax regime (also known as Pillar Two).\n \nOn July 4, 2025, the United States enacted into law the 2025 Tax Act. The 2025 Tax Act provides for several corporate tax changes including, but not limited to, restoring an election to recognize full expensing of domestic research and development costs, restoring immediate deductibility of certain capital expenditures, and changes to the computations of U.S. taxation on international earnings. We are in the process of evaluating the provisions of the 2025 Tax Act, including which elections we may or may not make.  While we expect that the 2025 Tax Act may have a positive impact on consolidated tax expense and cash flows, we do not expect it to be material. Elements of the enacted tax laws and regulations could be impacted by further legislative action as well as additional interpretations and guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service or Treasury and by similar governmental bodies in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Such changes could impact the estimates of the amounts the Company has recorded.\n \nCurrency and Other Risk Factors\nThe nature of our worldwide operations necessitates transacting in a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. That exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference. Some of the countries where we maintain offices and/or have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. Historically, derivative financial instruments have not been used to manage foreign currency risk. In lieu of the use of foreign currency derivatives we instead try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents. In the future, we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency risk. There are also regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely, which could be impacted by inter-governmental disputes or new trade restrictions. We had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net foreign currency transactional losses were approximately $3 million compared to net foreign currency losses of approximately $11 million in the same period in 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net foreign currency transactional losses were approximately $20 million compared to net foreign currency transactional gains of less than $1 million in the same period in 2024.\n \nHistorically, our business has not been adversely affected by inflation. Beginning in 2021 and continuing through 2025, many countries including the United States experienced increasing levels of inflation. As a result, our business continues to experience rising labor costs, service provider rate increases, higher rent and occupancy and other expenses. Due to the high degree of competition in the marketplace we may not be able to increase our prices to our customers to offset this inflationary pressure, which could lead to an erosion in our margins and operating income in the future. Conversely, raising our prices to keep pace with inflationary pressure may result in a decrease in volume and customer demand for our services. As we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate-sensitive indebtedness, we currently have limited direct exposure to increased interest expense resulting from increases in interest rates.\nThere is uncertainty as to how future regulatory requirements and volatility in oil prices will continue to impact future buy rates. Because fuel is an integral part of carriers' costs and impacts both our buy rates and sell rates, we would expect our revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices. To the extent that future fuel prices increase, and we are unable to pass through the increase to our customers, fuel price increases could adversely affect our operating income.\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $201 million and $723 million as compared with $90 million and $474 million for the same periods in 2024. The increases of $111 million and $249 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were primarily due changes in working capital. At September 30, 2025, working capital was $1,627 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $1,190 million. Other than our recorded lease liabilities, we had no long-term obligations or debt at September 30, 2025. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations.\nAs a customs broker, we make significant short-term cash advances for a select group of our credit-worthy customers. These cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and taxes to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world. Higher duty rates have resulted in increases in the amounts we advance on behalf of our customers. Given the short time frame until we are reimbursed, we do not expect these outlays to have a significant effect on our liquidity. Cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense, except for fees associated with this service charged to customers. The billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities. As a result of these “pass through” billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.\nFor customers that meet certain criteria, we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms. Management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems.\nOur business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations, and this is expected to continue in the future. Cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality. Historically, the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings. This results in positive cash flow. The increased activity associated with periods of higher demand (typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter) causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections. This cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash. However, there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future.\n \nCash used in investing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $10 million and $39 million as compared with $13 million and $30 million for the same periods in 2024, primarily for capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were primarily related to continuing investments in building and leasehold improvements, technology and equipment. Total anticipated capital expenditures in 2025 are currently estimated to be approximately $60 million. This includes routine capital expenditures, leasehold and building improvements and investments in technology.\nCash used in financing activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $150 million and $655 million as compared with $76 million and $659 million for the same periods in 2024. We use the proceeds from stock option exercises, employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase our common stock on the open market to reduce outstanding shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we used cash to repurchase 1.8 million and 5.3 million shares of common stock, compared to 1.2 million and 5.1 million shares of common stock during the same periods in 2024.\nWe follow established guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. Historically, our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by disruptions occurring in the credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future.\nWe cannot predict what further impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy, inflation, future interest rates, and political conflicts and uncertainty, may have on our operating results, freight volumes, pricing, amounts advanced on behalf of our customers, changes in consumer demand, carrier stability and capacity, customers’ abilities to pay or changes in competitors' behavior.\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe maintain international unsecured bank lines of credit for short-term working capital purposes. A few of these credit lines are supported by standby letters of credit issued by a United States bank or guarantees issued by the Company to the foreign banks issuing the credit line. At September 30, 2025, borrowings under these credit lines were $36 million and we were contingently liable for $80 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees. The standby letters of credit and guarantees primarily relate to obligations of our foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT) taxation. The total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the accounting records of the respective foreign subsidiaries, and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform.\nWe have lease arrangements primarily for office and warehouse space in all districts where we conduct business. As of September 30, 2025, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $724 million, with $143 million payable within 12 months.\nWe typically enter into unconditional purchase obligations with asset-based providers (generally short-term in nature) reserving space on a guaranteed basis. The pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions. We only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill. In the regular course of business, we also enter into agreements with service providers to maintain or operate equipment, facilities or software that can be longer than one year. We also regularly have contractual obligations for specific projects related to improvements of our owned or leased facilities and information technology infrastructure. Purchase obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2025 totaled $274 million.\nOur foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the U.S. parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and funds necessary to finance local capital expenditures. In some cases, our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls or could be impacted by inter-governmental disputes or new trade restrictions. At September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalent balances of $515 million were held by our non-United States subsidiaries, of which $18 million was held in banks in the United States. Earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States."
