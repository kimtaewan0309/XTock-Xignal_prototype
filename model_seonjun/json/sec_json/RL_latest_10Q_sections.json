We utilize a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As such, fiscal year 2026 will end on March 28, 2026 and will be a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2026\"). Fiscal year 2025 ended on March 29, 2025 and was also a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2025\"). The second quarter of Fiscal 2026 ended on September 27, 2025 and was a 13-week period. The second quarter of Fiscal 2025 ended on September 28, 2024 and was also a 13-week period.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\"MD&A\") is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto to help provide an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nOverview.\n    This section provides a general description of our business, global economic conditions and industry trends, and a summary of our financial performance for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 27, 2025. In addition, this section includes a discussion of recent developments and transactions affecting comparability that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition, and in anticipating future trends.\n•\nResults of operations.\n    This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the three-month and six-month periods ended September 28, 2024.\n•\nFinancial condition and liquidity.\n    This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity as of September 27, 2025, which includes (i) an analysis of our financial condition as compared to the prior fiscal year-end; (ii) an analysis of changes in our cash flows for the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the six months ended September 28, 2024; (iii) an analysis of our liquidity, including the availability under our commercial paper borrowing program and credit facilities, our supplier finance program, outstanding debt and covenant compliance, common stock repurchases, and payments of dividends; and (iv) a description of any material changes in our material cash requirements since March 29, 2025.\n38\n•\nMarket risk management.\n    This section discusses any significant changes in our risk exposures related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and our investments since March 29, 2025. \n•\nCritical accounting policies.\n     This section discusses any significant changes in our critical accounting policies since March 29, 2025. Critical accounting policies typically require significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 3 of the Fiscal 2025 10-K.\n•\nRecently issued accounting standards.\n    This section discusses the potential impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition of certain accounting standards that have been recently issued.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nOur Company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of luxury lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear & accessories, home, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Double RL, Polo Ralph Lauren, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others. \nWe diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel categories, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.\nWe organize our business into the following three reportable segments:\n•\nNorth America \n— Our North America segment, representing approximately 43% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses primarily in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, and our digital commerce sites, www.RalphLauren.com and www.RalphLauren.ca. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores.  \n•\nEurope \n— Our Europe segment, representing approximately 31% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital and licensee partners. \n•\nAsia \n— Our Asia segment, representing approximately 24% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. In addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and various third-party digital and licensee partners.\nNo operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately 2% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances.\nApproximately 57% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.\n39\nOur business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income (loss), and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns. Accordingly, our operating results and cash flows for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results and cash flows that may be expected for the full Fiscal 2026.\nRecent Developments\nNext Generation Transformation Project\nWe are in the early stages of executing a large-scale, multi-year global project that is expected to significantly transform the way in which we operate our business and further enable our long-term strategic pivot towards a global direct-to-consumer-oriented model (the \"Next Generation Transformation project\" or \"NGT project\"). The NGT project will be completed in phases and involves the redesigning of certain end-to-end processes and the implementation of a suite of technology systems on a global scale. Such efforts are expected to result in significant process improvements and the creation of synergies across core areas of operations, including merchandise buying and planning, procurement, inventory management, retail and wholesale operations, and financial planning and reporting, better enabling us to optimize inventory levels and increase the speed with which we react to changes in consumer demand across markets, among other benefits.  \nIn connection with the preliminary phase of the NGT project, we incurred other charges of $25.7 million and $36.7 million during the three-month and six-month periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively, and $5.7 million and $8.0 million during the three-month and six-month periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively, which were recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nGlobal Economic Conditions and Industry Trends\nThe global economy and retail industry are impacted by many factors beyond our control. Most recently, the U.S. announced significant changes to its trade policies, including widespread tariff increases on imported goods, with potential further increases and revisions or terminations to existing trade agreements. In response, many countries have announced or are otherwise considering retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports and other trade restrictions. This has led to significant uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries, as well as concerns about a global trade war, higher inflation, and a potential global recession, which has already caused significant volatility of global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the U.S. signed into law tax legislation commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July 2025, which extends many of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as well as introduces certain other new provisions. \nOther recent economic conditions, including ongoing inflationary pressures, organized labor disputes, high interest rates, significant foreign currency volatility, and military conflicts (as discussed below), continue to impact consumer discretionary income levels, spending, and sentiment in the U.S. and beyond. In response to such pressures, as well as to reduce elevated inventory levels, many retailers (particularly in the U.S.) continue to resort to promotional activity in an attempt to offset traffic declines and increase conversion. Furthermore, the department store sector has also experienced consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies, and other ownership changes in recent times, as well as an increase in store closures.\nThe global economy has also been negatively impacted by ongoing military conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, militant attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea, and other hostilities in the Middle East, such as the Israel-Iran conflict. Although our voluntary decision to suspend operations in Russia has not resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and our ongoing operations in Israel are also not material, our business has been, and may continue to be, affected by the broader macroeconomic implications resulting from these and other military conflicts, including inflationary pressures, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, increases in energy prices, food shortages, and financial market volatility, among other factors, which have adversely impacted consumer sentiment and confidence. It is not clear at this time how long these conflicts will endure, or if they will escalate further with additional countries taking part, which could further amplify the impacts of the various macroeconomic factors described above and potentially result in a global recession. \n40\nThe global supply chain has also been negatively impacted by various factors, including disruptions at U.S. ports and in the Red Sea. Although our business has not been significantly impacted by such disruptions, we have experienced some shipping delays impacting the timing of inventory receipts, and if such disruptions were to continue over a prolonged period, it could result in further inventory receipt delays and/or higher freight costs in the near-term and beyond.\nWe have implemented various global strategies to address many of these challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term profitable growth by strengthening our consumer-facing areas and driving a more efficient operating model. We continue to monitor the current geopolitical landscape, including the potential impact of changes to tariffs. We have taken proactive measures in recent years to diversify our supply chain from a geographic perspective and believe we can further mitigate potential cost pressures associated with new tariffs through a combination of our disciplined inventory management, leveraging our relationships with suppliers to reduce product costs, our ability to change country of origin, and pricing actions. However, our profitability will be negatively impacted should tariffs increase significantly across our supply chain. Regarding mitigating inflationary pressures, our strategy includes numerous levers, including our ability to effectively increase prices, leveraging our diversified supply chain and strong supplier relationships, and leveraging our in-house quality control to reduce time and cost from the manufacturing process, among other efforts. Despite the competitive environment, we plan to continue driving our broader long-term strategy of brand elevation, which includes multiple levers to continue driving average unit retail growth and brand equity.\nWe will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and adjust our operating strategies to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting and elevating the value of our brand.\nFor a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n\" in our Fiscal 2025 10-K.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nOperating Results\nDuring the three months ended September 27, 2025, we reported net revenues of $2.011 billion, net income of $207.5 million, and net income per diluted share of $3.32, as compared to net revenues of $1.726 billion, net income of $147.9 million, and net income per diluted share of $2.31 during the three months ended September 28, 2024. During the six months ended September 27, 2025, we reported net revenues of $3.730 billion, net income of $427.9 million, and net income per diluted share of $6.85, as compared to net revenues of $3.238 billion, net income of $316.5 million, and net income per diluted share of $4.93 during the six months ended September 28, 2024. The comparability of our operating results has been affected by net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits), as well as foreign currency volatility. Our operating results are also susceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nOur operating performance for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year periods reflected revenue growth of 16.5% and 15.2%, respectively, on a reported basis and 14.0% and 12.8%, respectively, on a constant currency basis, as defined within \"\nTransactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\"\n \nbelow. Net revenues reflected growth across all of our reportable segments.\nOur gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 100 basis points to 68.0% during the three months ended September 27, 2025 and by 130 basis points to 69.9% during the six months ended September 27, 2025, as compared to the prior fiscal year periods, primarily driven by average unit retail (\"AUR\") growth, favorable product mix, favorable foreign currency effects, and lower cotton costs, more than offsetting pressure from tariffs and non-cotton products costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses as a percentage of net revenues during the three months ended September 27, 2025\n \ndeclined by 160 basis points to 53.9% and by 130 basis points to 54.5% during the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year periods, largely attributable to operating leverage on higher net revenues despite higher compensation-related expenses, marketing investments, and variable selling expenses.\nNet income increased by $59.6 million to $207.5 million during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 28, 2024, primarily due to a $66.8 million increase in our operating income, partially offset by a $12.1 million increase in non-operating expense, net. Net income per diluted share increased by $1.01 to $3.32 per share during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 28, 2024, primarily driven by the higher level of net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Net income increased by $111.4 million to $427.9 million during the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the six months \n41\nended September 28, 2024, primarily due to a $131.9 million increase in our operating income, partially offset by a $15.8 million increase in non-operating expense, net. Net income per diluted share increased by $1.92 to $6.85 per share during the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the six months ended September 28, 2024, driven by the higher level of net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nOur operating results during each of the three-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $37.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $29.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, and $14.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, respectively. During the six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, our operating results were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $56.6 million and $25.8 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $44.7 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, and $20.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, respectively.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nWe ended the second quarter of Fiscal 2026 in a net cash and short-term investments position (calculated as cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term investments, less total debt) of $407.8 million, as compared to $940.4 million as of the end of Fiscal 2025. The decrease in our net cash and short-term investments position was primarily due to our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $435.9 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $281.1 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $106.0 million, partially offset by our operating cash flows of $229.3 million and the favorable effect of exchange rate changes of $60.3 million, primarily related to our cash and cash equivalents.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $229.3 million during the six months ended September 27, 2025, as compared to $374.5 million during the six months ended September 28, 2024. The net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by an increase in net income before non-cash charges.\nOur equity decreased to $2.582 billion as of September 27, 2025 compared to $2.589 billion as of March 29, 2025 due to our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during the six months ended September 27, 2025, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements.\nTransactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparability of our operating results for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 has been affected by certain transactions, including net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $37.3 million and $56.6 million, respectively, and $18.4 million and $25.8 million during the three-month and six-month periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nBecause we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the \"Results of Operations\" section where applicable.\n42\nOur discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics are calculated on a constant currency basis. \nOur \"Results of Operations\" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting comparability.

On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $56.3 million, reflecting an increase of $58.7 million in comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected low-double digit AUR growth during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, as well as higher traffic.

On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $82.7 million, or 14.6%.\nThe $122.4 million increase in Europe net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $75.3 million increase related to our Europe wholesale business largely driven by stronger re-order trends, a timing shift of inventory shipments from the second half of Fiscal 2026 into the second quarter, and favorable foreign currency effects of $21.4 million, which more than offset planned reductions within the off-price wholesale channel; and\n•\na $47.1 million increase related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of favorable foreign currency effects of $18.3 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $28.8 million, reflecting increases of $23.4 million in comparable store sales and $5.4 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected high-single digit AUR growth during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period.

On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $62.0 million, or 16.3%.\nThe $65.4 million increase in Asia net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $64.5 million increase related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of favorable foreign currency effects of $3.4 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $61.1 million, reflecting increases of $46.2 million in comparable store sales and $14.9 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected high-teens AUR growth during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, as well as higher traffic. The following table summarizes the percentage changes in comparable store sales related to our Asia retail business: \n \n% Change\nDigital commerce\n36\n%\nBrick and mortar\n14\n%\nTotal comparable store sales\n16\n%\nGross Profit.    \nGross profit increased by $210.7 million, or 18.2%, to $1.366 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025, including favorable foreign currency effects of $33.9 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 68.0% for the three months ended September 27, 2025 from 67.0% for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The 100 basis point increase reflected favorable foreign currency effects of approximately 30 basis points. The remaining 70 basis point improvement was primarily due to AUR growth of approximately low-double digits, favorable product mix, and lower cotton costs, more than offsetting pressure from tariffs and non-cotton products costs.\nGross profit is the difference between total net revenues and cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes the amounts incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale to our customers, including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with \n46\npreparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges, are included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\n    SG&A expenses include costs relating to compensation and benefits, marketing and advertising, rent and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A expenses increased by $125.0 million, or 13.0%, to $1.083 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025, including unfavorable foreign currency effects of $16.0 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined to 53.9% for the three months ended September 27, 2025 from 55.5% for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The 160 basis point improvement was largely attributable to operating leverage on higher net revenues despite higher compensation-related expenses, marketing investments, and variable selling expenses.\nThe $125.0 million increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:\nThree Months Ended September 27, 2025\nCompared to\nThree Months Ended September 28, 2024\n(millions)\nSG&A expense category:\nCompensation-related expenses\n$\n74.9 \nRent and occupancy expenses\n17.9 \nMarketing and advertising expenses\n6.0 \nShipping and handling costs\n6.0 \nSelling-related expenses\n5.0 \nStaff-related expenses\n4.4 \nOther\n10.8 \nTotal increase in SG&A expenses\n$\n125.0 \nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net.    \nDuring the three-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $9.5 million and $9.0 million, respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $2.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. In addition, during the three-month periods ended September 27, 2025  and September 28, 2024, we recorded other charges of $25.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively, in connection with our Next Generation Transformation project (refer to \n\"Recent Developments\"\n for additional discussion) and other income of $0.7 million and $0.4 million during the three-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively, related to consideration received from Regent, L.P. in connection with our previously sold Club Monaco business. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. \nOperating Income.\n    Operating income increased by $66.8 million, or 37.3%, to $245.7 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, reflecting favorable foreign currency effects of $17.9 million. Our operating results during the three-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $37.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 12.2% for the three months ended September 27, 2025, reflecting a 180 basis point increase from the prior fiscal year period. The increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the increase in our gross margin, as well as the decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by the higher net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) recorded during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, all as previously discussed.\n47\nOperating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes i\nn each reportable segment's operating margin from the comparable prior fiscal year period, are provided below:\n \nThree Months Ended\n \n \nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n \n \nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\n$\nChange\nMargin\nChange\n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \nSegment:\nNorth America\n$\n161.6 \n19.4%\n$\n121.9 \n16.5%\n$\n39.7 \n290 bps\nEurope\n202.3 \n29.4%\n145.9 \n25.8%\n56.4 \n360 bps\nAsia\n111.2 \n25.0%\n86.3 \n22.7%\n24.9 \n230 bps\nOther non-reportable segments\n38.3 \n86.3%\n33.5 \n82.9%\n4.8 \n340 bps\nTotal segment operating income\n513.4 \n387.6 \n125.8 \nCorporate expenses, net\n(230.4)\n(190.3)\n(40.1)\nRestructuring and other charges, net\n(a)\n \n(37.3)\n(18.4)\n(18.9)\nTotal operating income\n$\n245.7 \n12.2%\n$\n178.9 \n10.4%\n$\n66.8 \n180 bps\n(a)\nSee discussion above for additional information related to restructuring and other charges, net recorded during the fiscal periods presented.\nNorth America operating margin \nimproved by 290 basis points, primarily due to a decline of 360 basis points in SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by decline of 70 basis points in gross margin.\nEurope operating margin\n improved by 360 basis points, primarily due to an increase of 260 basis points in gross margin and a decline of 100 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the favorable impact of approximately 110 basis points related to foreign currency effects.\nAsia operating margin\n improved by 230 basis points, primarily due to an increase of 190 basis points in gross margin and a decline of 40 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues.\nCorporate expenses\n increased by $40.1 million to $230.4 million during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses of $41.5 million.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net.    \nNon-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income (expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses. During the three months ended September 27, 2025, we reported non-operating expense, net, of $2.9 million as compared to non-operating income, net, of $9.2 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024. The $12.1 million increase in non-operating expense, net was driven by:\n•\na $4.5 million increase in interest expense driven by the higher average level of outstanding debt during the three months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior year fiscal period as a result of our issuance of the 5.000% Senior Notes in June 2025 (see \"\nFinancial Conditional and Liquidity \n—\n Cash flows\n\");\n•\na $4.3 million increase in other expense, net driven by higher net foreign currency losses; and\n•\na $3.3 million decline in interest income largely due to lower interest rates in financial markets. \nIncome Tax Provision.\n    The income tax provision represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies.\nThe income tax provision and effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2025 were $35.3 million and 14.6%, respectively, as compared to $40.2 million and 21.4%, respectively, for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The $4.9 million decrease in our income tax provision was primarily driven by a 680 basis point decline in our effective tax \n48\nrate, partly offset by the increase in our pretax income. The decline in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable impact of uncertain tax positions, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the tax impacts of compensation-related adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable tax impact of earnings generated in higher taxed jurisdictions when compared to the prior fiscal period. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income.\n    Net income increased to $207.5 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, from $147.9 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The $59.6 million increase in net income was due to the increase in our operating income, partially offset by the increase in non-operating expense, net, both as previously discussed. Our operating results during the three-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $37.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $29.3 million and $14.2 million, respectively.\nNet Income per Diluted Share.\n    Net income per diluted share increased to $3.32 for the three months ended September 27, 2025, from $2.31 for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The $1.01 per share increase was primarily driven by the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the three months ended September 27, 2025 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share for the three-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 were also negatively impacted by $0.47 per share and $0.23 per share, respectively, attributable to net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits), as previously discussed.\n49\nSix Months Ended September 27, 2025 Compared to Six Months Ended September 28, 2024 \nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions.

On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $135.7 million, reflecting increases of $103.1 million in comparable store sales and $32.6 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected mid-teens AUR growth during the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, as well as higher traffic. The following table summarizes the percentage changes in comparable store sales related to our Asia retail business: \n \n% Change\nDigital commerce\n36\n%\nBrick and mortar\n15\n%\nTotal comparable store sales\n17\n%\nGross Profit.   \n Gross profit increased by $387.2 million, or 17.4%, to $2.609 billion for the six months ended September 27, 2025, including favorable foreign currency effects of $62.7 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 69.9% for the six months ended September 27, 2025 from 68.6% for the six months ended September 28, 2024. The 130 basis point increase reflected favorable foreign currency effects of approximately 20 basis points and the favorable impact of approximately 20 basis points attributable to geographic and channel mix. The remaining 90 basis point improvement was primarily due to AUR growth of approximately low-teens, favorable product mix, and lower cotton costs, more than offsetting pressure from tariffs and non-cotton products costs.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\n    SG&A expenses increased by $224.5 million, or 12.4%, to $2.033 billion for the six months ended September 27, 2025, including unfavorable foreign currency effects of $31.3 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined to 54.5% for the six months ended September 27, 2025 from 55.8% for the six months ended September 28, 2024. The 130 basis point decline was largely attributable to operating leverage on higher net revenues despite higher compensation-related expenses, marketing investments, and variable selling expenses.\nThe $224.5 million increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:\nSix Months Ended September 26, 2025\nCompared to\nSix Months Ended September 28, 2024\n(millions)\nSG&A expense category:\nCompensation-related expenses\n$\n101.2 \nRent and occupancy expenses\n36.9 \nMarketing and advertising expenses\n32.8 \nShipping and handling costs\n15.9 \nSelling-related expenses\n14.4 \nStaff-related expenses\n8.4 \nOther\n14.9 \nTotal increase in SG&A expenses\n$\n224.5 \n52\nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net.    \nDuring the six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, we recorded net restructuring charges of $15.9 million and $12.3 million, respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $5.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations in connection with our restructuring activities for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. In addition, during the six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, we recorded other charges of $36.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively, in connection with our Next Generation Transformation project (refer to \n\"Recent Developments\"\n for additional discussion), and recorded other income of $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively, related to consideration received from Regent, L.P. in connection with our previously sold Club Monaco business. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income.\n   Operating income increased by $131.9 million, or 34.0%, to $519.3 million for the six months ended September 27, 2025, reflecting favorable foreign currency effects of $31.4 million. Our operating results during the six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $56.6 million and $25.8 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 13.9% for the six months ended September 27, 2025, reflecting a 190 basis point increase from the prior fiscal year period. The increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the increase in our gross margin, as well as a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by higher net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) recorded during the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period, all as previously discussed.\nOperating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the comparable prior fiscal year period, are provided below:\n \nSix Months Ended\n \n \nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\n \n \nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\n$\nChange\nMargin\nChange\n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \nSegment:\nNorth America\n$\n297.1 \n20.0%\n$\n241.7 \n17.9%\n$\n55.4 \n210 bps\nEurope\n348.5 \n28.0%\n266.5 \n25.5%\n82.0 \n250 bps\nAsia\n256.6 \n27.9%\n193.5 \n25.1%\n63.1 \n280 bps\nOther non-reportable segments\n68.9 \n87.4%\n63.1 \n84.8%\n5.8 \n260 bps\nTotal segment operating income\n971.1 \n764.8 \n206.3 \nCorporate expenses, net\n(395.2)\n(351.6)\n(43.6)\nRestructuring and other charges, net\n(a)\n \n(56.6)\n(25.8)\n(30.8)\nTotal operating income\n$\n519.3 \n13.9%\n$\n387.4 \n12.0%\n$\n131.9 \n190 bps\n(a)\nSee discussion above for additional information related to restructuring and other charges, net recorded during the fiscal periods presented.\nNorth America operating margin\n improved by 210 basis points, primarily due to a decline of 230 basis points in SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenues.\nEurope operating margin \nimproved by 250 basis points, primarily due to an increase of 240 basis points in gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the favorable impact of approximately 120 basis points related to foreign currency effects.\nAsia operating margin\n improved by 280 basis points, primarily due to an increase of 170 basis points in gross margin and a decline of 110 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impact of approximately 50 basis points related to foreign currency effects.\nCorporate expenses\n increased by $43.6 million to $395.2 million during the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year period. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses of $46.4 million.\n53\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net.    \nDuring the six months ended September 27, 2025, we reported non-operating income, net of $1.5 million as compared to $17.3 million during the six months ended September 28, 2024. The $15.8 million net decrease in non-operating income, net was primarily driven by :\n•\nan $8.6 million decline in interest income largely due to lower interest rates in financial markets;\n•\na $5.1 million increase in interest expense driven by the higher average level of outstanding debt during the six months ended September 27, 2025 as compared to the prior year fiscal period as a result of our issuance of the 5.000% Senior Notes in June 2025 (see \"\nFinancial Conditional and Liquidity \n—\n Cash flows\n\"); and\n•\na $2.1 million increase in other expense, net driven by higher net foreign currency losses.\nIncome Tax Provision.    \nThe income tax provision and effective tax rate for the six months ended September 27, 2025 were $92.9 million and 17.8%, respectively, compared to $88.2 million and 21.8%, respectively, for the six months ended September 28, 2024. The $4.7 million increase in our income tax provision was primarily driven by an increase in our pretax income, partially offset by the 400 basis point decline in our effective tax rate. The decline in our effective tax rate was due to the favorable impact of uncertain tax positions, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the tax impacts of compensation-related adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable tax impact of earnings generated in higher taxed jurisdictions when compared to the prior fiscal period and the absence of favorable state and local credits received in the prior fiscal year period. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income.\n    Net income increased to $427.9 million for the six months ended September 27, 2025, from $316.5 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024. The $111.4 million increase in net income was primarily due to the increase in our operating income, partially offset by the decrease in our non-operating income, net, both as previously discussed. Our operating results during the six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $56.6 million and $25.8 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $44.7 million and $20.2 million, respectively.\nNet Income per Diluted Share.\n    Net income per diluted share increased to $6.85 for the six months ended September 27, 2025, from $4.93 for the six months ended September 28, 2024. The $1.92 per share increase was primarily driven by the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the six months ended September 27, 2025 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share for the six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 were also negatively impacted by $0.71 per share and $0.31 per share, respectively, attributable to net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits), as previously discussed.\n54\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nFinancial Condition\n \nThe following table presents our financial condition as of September 27, 2025 and March 29, 2025:\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nMarch 29,\n2025\n$\nChange\n \n(millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,443.0 \n$\n1,922.5 \n$\n(479.5)\nShort-term investments\n202.5 \n160.5 \n42.0 \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(a)\n— \n(399.7)\n399.7 \nLong-term debt\n(a)\n(1,237.7)\n(742.9)\n(494.8)\nNet cash and short-term investments\n \n$\n407.8 \n$\n940.4 \n$\n(532.6)\nEquity\n$\n2,582.2 \n$\n2,588.5 \n$\n(6.3)\n(a)\nSee Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt.\nThe decrease in our net cash and short-term investments position at September 27, 2025 as compared to March 29, 2025 was primarily due to our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $435.9 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $281.1 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $106.0 million, partially offset by our operating cash flows of $229.3 million and the favorable effect of exchange rate changes of $60.3 million, primarily related to our cash and cash equivalents.\nThe decrease in our equity was attributable to our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during the six months ended September 27, 2025, largely offset by our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table details our cash flows for the six-month periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024:\n \nSix Months Ended\n \nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\n$\nChange\n \n(millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n229.3 \n$\n374.5 \n$\n(145.2)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(309.8)\n(279.8)\n(30.0)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(459.2)\n(439.9)\n(19.3)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n60.3 \n36.8 \n23.5 \nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n(479.4)\n$\n(308.4)\n$\n(171.0)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities.\n    Net cash provided by operating activities was $229.3 million during the six months ended September 27, 2025, as compared to $374.5 million during the six months ended September 28, 2024. The $145.2 million net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by an increase in net income before non-cash charges.\nThe net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:\n•\nan unfavorable change in inventory driven by higher in-transit inventory, as well as higher product and freight costs;\n55\n•\nan unfavorable change in our accounts payable driven by the timing of cash payments, as well as a net unfavorable change in accrued liabilities largely driven by accrued payroll and benefits resulting from the higher bonus payout during the first quarter of Fiscal 2026 as compared to the prior fiscal year period; and\n•\nan unfavorable change in income tax receivables and payables due to higher tax payments in connection with certain non-routine tax transactions and the higher level of pretax income, as well as the timing of tax payments. \nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities.    \nNet cash used in investing activities was $309.8 million during the six months ended September 27, 2025, as compared to $279.8 million during the six months ended September 28, 2024. The $30.0 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $206.0 million increase in capital expenditures. During the six months ended September 27, 2025, we spent $281.1 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $75.1 million during the six months ended September 28, 2024. Our capital expenditures during the six months ended September 27, 2025 primarily related to the purchase of real estate, store openings and renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems, and corporate office renovations.\nThis increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by:\n•\na $171.0 million decrease in purchases of investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. During the six months ended September 27, 2025, we made net investment purchases of $34.7 million, as compared to $205.7 million during the six months ended September 28, 2024.\nOver the course of Fiscal 2026, we expect to spend approximately 4% to 5% of net revenues on capital expenditures, primarily related to purchases of real estate, store openings and renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems (including those related to our Next Generation Transformation project), and a continuation of our corporate office renovations.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities.\n    Net cash used in financing activities was $459.2 million during the six months ended September 27, 2025, as compared to $439.9 million during the six months ended September 28, 2024. The $19.3 million net increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $105.7 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During the six months ended September 27, 2025, we used $313.1 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $122.8 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during the six months ended September 28, 2024, we used $274.7 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $55.5 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes.\nThis increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by:\n•\na $98.2 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During the six months ended September 27, 2025, we received $498.2 million in proceeds from our issuance of the 5.000% Senior Notes (as defined below), a portion of which was used to repay $400 million of our 3.750% unsecured senior notes that matured in September 2025. On a comparative basis, during the six months ended September 28, 2024, we did not issue or repay any debt.\n56\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity and/or funds to refinance existing debt.\nDuring the six months ended September 27, 2025, we generated $229.3 million of net cash flows from our operations. As of September 27, 2025, we had $1.645 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $1.123 billion were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings generated on or before December 31, 2017 that were subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax in connection with U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") are not considered to be permanently reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax. However, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to applicable U.S. and foreign taxes.\nThe following table presents the total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and Commercial Paper Program as of September 27, 2025:\n \nSeptember 27, 2025\nDescription\n(a)\nTotal\nAvailability\nBorrowings\nOutstanding\nRemaining\nAvailability\n \n(millions)\nGlobal Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program\n(b)\n$\n750 \n$\n10 \n(c)\n$\n740 \nPan-Asia Credit Facilities\n34 \n— \n34 \nJapan Overdraft Facility\n33 \n— \n33 \n(a)\nAs defined in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n(b)\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, we do not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Global Credit Facility to exceed $750 million.\n(c)\nRepresents outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the Global Credit Facility as of September 27, 2025.\nWe believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of September 27, 2025, there were seven financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1.500 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments.\nBorrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the \"Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities\") are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating banks (as described within Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), subject to availability of the respective banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility and the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future.\nOur sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, payment of dividends, debt repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and \n57\nother catastrophic events, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations.\nSee Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and Note 11 of the Fiscal 2025 10-K for additional information relating to our credit facilities.\nSupplier Finance Program\nWe support a voluntary supplier finance program which provides certain of our inventory suppliers the opportunity, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables due from us (which are generally due within 90 days) to a participating financial institution in exchange for receipt of a discounted payment amount made earlier than the payment term stipulated between us and the supplier. Our vendor payment terms and amounts due are not impacted by a supplier's decision to participate in the program. We have not pledged any assets and do not provide guarantees under the supplier finance program. Our payment obligations outstanding under our supplier finance program were $243.7 million and $181.0 million as of September 27, 2025 and March 29, 2025, respectively, and were recorded within accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets.\nDebt and Covenant Compliance\nIn August 2018, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on September 15, 2025 with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the \"3.750% Senior Notes\"). In June 2020, we completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on June 15, 2022 with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the \"1.700% Senior Notes\"), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually (the \"2.950% Senior Notes\"). In June 2025, we completed another registered public debt offering and issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2032, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.000%, payable semi-annually (the \"5.000% Senior Notes\"). \nThe indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 2.950% Senior Notes and 5.000% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the \"Indenture\") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. \nWe have a credit facility that provides for a $750 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through June 30, 2028, which may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures, certain investments, general corporate purposes, and for funding of acquisitions, as well as used to support the issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the \"Global Credit Facility\"). Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to expand the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1.500 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.\nThe Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of September 27, 2025, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.\nSee Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and Note 11 of the Fiscal 2025 10-K for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nOn May 15, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase up to an additional $1.500 billion of our Class A common stock, excluding related excise taxes. As of September 27, 2025, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $1.539 billion. Repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions.\nSee Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase program.\n58\nDividends\nWe have generally maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock since 2003. \nOn May 15, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.825 to $0.9125 per share. \nWe intend to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of our common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will ultimately be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.\nSee Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nIn June 2025, we completed a $500 million registered public debt offering of 5.000% Senior Notes due June 15, 2032 (see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Our aggregate interest obligation related to this debt is approximately $175 million, with interest payable semi-annually.\nThere have been no substantial changes to our material cash requirements as disclosed in our Fiscal 2025 10-K, other than as discussed above and those which occur in the ordinary course of business. Refer to the\n \n\"\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity — Contractual and Other Obligations\n\"\n \nsection of the MD&A in our Fiscal 2025 10-K for detailed disclosure of our material cash requirements as of March 29, 2025.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nAs discussed in Note 13 of the Fiscal 2025 10-K and Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of levels and types of risks, including the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, in the normal course of business we assess such risks and, in accordance with our established policies and procedures, may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate them. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.\nGiven our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of September 27, 2025. Further, our derivative instruments, held across seven creditworthy financial institutions, were all in net liability positions by counterparty as of September 27, 2025.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. Refer to Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments as of September 27, 2025.\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nWe use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian \n59\nDollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally hedge a portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses.\nCross-Currency Swap Contracts\nWe periodically designate pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries. These contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of our senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of our fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed rate Euro-denominated obligations.\nSee Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign currency exposures and the types of derivative instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nInvestment Risk Management\nAs of September 27, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $1.443 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included $202.5 million of short-term investments, consisting of investments in time deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days.\nWe actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of September 27, 2025.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 of the Fiscal 2025 10-K. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to the \"\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\" section of the MD&A in our Fiscal 2025 10-K.\nThere have been no significant changes in the application of our critical accounting policies since March 29, 2025.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe performed our annual goodwill assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2026. In performing the assessment, we identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair values and/or carrying amounts of our reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, we also considered the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the results of which indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.\n60\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued accounting standards which have impacted our consolidated financial statements, or may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods."
