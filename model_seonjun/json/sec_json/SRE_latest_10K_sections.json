Our businesses invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure, and provide electric and gas services to customers.\nSempra was formed in 1998 through a business combination of Enova Corporation and Pacific Enterprises, the holding companies of our regulated public utilities in California: SDG&E, which began operations in 1881, and SoCalGas, which began operations in 1867. We have since expanded our regulated public utility presence into Texas through our 80.25% interest in Oncor and 50% interest in Sharyland Utilities. Sempra Infrastructure’s assets include investments in the U.S. and Mexico with a focus on LNG, energy networks and low carbon solutions.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur mission is to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company. We are primarily focused on transmission and distribution investments, among other areas, that we believe are capable of producing stable cash flows and earnings visibility, with the goals of delivering safe, reliable and increasingly clean forms of energy affordably to customers and increasing shareholder value.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT\nSempra’s business activities are organized under the following reportable segments:\n▪\nSempra California\n▪\nSempra Texas Utilities\n▪\nSempra Infrastructure\nSDG&E and SoCalGas each has one reportable segment.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  12\nTable of Contents\nSempra California\nSDG&E\nSDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of, at December 31, 2024, approximately 3.6 million and natural gas services to approximately 3.3 million of that population, covering an approximate 4,100 square mile service territory in Southern California that encompasses San Diego County and an adjacent portion of Orange County. \nSDG&E’s assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory:\nWe describe SDG&E’s electric utility operations below. We describe SDG&E’s natural gas utility operations below in “Sempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations.” For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing SDG&E’s business, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California.”\nElectric Transmission and Distribution System. \nService to SDG&E’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system, which includes substations and overhead and underground lines. These electric facilities are primarily in the San Diego, Imperial and Orange counties of California, and in Arizona and Nevada and consisted of 2,021 miles of transmission lines, 24,149 miles of distribution lines and 159 substations at December 31, 2024. Occasionally, various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth and maintain reliability and safety. \nSDG&E’s 500-kV Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG&E’s share of the line is 1,163 MW, although it can be less under certain system conditions. SDG&E’s Sunrise Powerlink is a 500-kV transmission line constructed by SDG&E and operated by the California ISO. Both of these lines together provide SDG&E with import capability of 3,900 MW of power.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  13\nTable of Contents\nMexico’s Baja California transmission system is connected to SDG&E’s system via two 230-kV interconnections with combined capacity of up to 600 MW in the north-to-south direction and 800 MW in the south-to-north direction. However, it can be less under certain system conditions.\nSDG&E’s system is connected to Edison’s transmission system via five 230-kV transmission lines.\nElectric Resources.\n SDG&E supplies power from its own electric generation facilities and procures power on a long-term basis from other suppliers for resale through CPUC-approved PPAs or purchases on the spot market. SDG&E does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes. SDG&E’s electric resources at December 31, 2024 were as follows: \nELECTRIC RESOURCES\n(1)\nContract \nexpiration date\nNet operating\n capacity (MW)\n% of total\nSDG&E:\nOwned generation facilities, natural gas\n(2)\n1,204 \n24 \n%\nPPAs:\nRenewable energy:\nWind\n2025 to 2042\n918 \n19 \nSolar\n2030 to 2042\n1,526 \n31 \nOther\n2025 and thereafter\n155 \n3 \nTolling and other\n2025 to 2042\n1,113 \n23 \nTotal\n4,916 \n100 \n%\n(1)\n    \nExcludes approximately 367 MW of energy storage owned and approximately 632 MW of energy storage contracted.\n(2)\n    \nSDG&E owns and operates four natural gas-fired power plants, three of which are in California and one is in Nevada.\nCharges under contracts with suppliers are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity. Tolling contracts are PPAs under which SDG&E provides natural gas to the energy supplier. \nSDG&E procures natural gas under short-term contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with PPAs. Purchases from various southwestern U.S. suppliers are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices, which can be subject to volatility.\nSDG&E participates in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities, power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Participants can make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC. Participation in the Western Systems Power Pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk.\nCustomers and Demand.\n SDG&E provides electric services through the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes: \nELECTRIC CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES\nCustomer meter count\nVolumes\n(1)\n(millions of kWh)\nDecember 31,\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSDG&E:\nResidential\n285,881 \n1,348 \n2,004 \n3,940 \nCommercial\n31,313 \n1,363 \n1,868 \n2,850 \nIndustrial\n319 \n441 \n670 \n909 \nStreet and highway lighting\n1,574 \n55 \n77 \n101 \n319,087 \n3,207 \n4,619 \n7,800 \nCCA and DA\n1,213,258 \n13,484 \n12,228 \n9,900 \nTotal\n1,532,345 \n16,691 \n16,847 \n17,700 \n(1)    \nIncludes intercompany sales.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  14\nTable of Contents\nSDG&E currently provides procurement service for a portion of its customer load. Most customers receive electric procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG&E through programs such as CCA and DA. In such cases, SDG&E no longer procures energy for this departed load. Accordingly, SDG&E’s CCA and DA customers receive primarily transportation and distribution services from SDG&E.\nCCA is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction (city or county) offers such a program, and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. Several jurisdictions in SDG&E’s territory have implemented CCA, including the City of San Diego in 2022. Additional jurisdictions may be considering CCA.\nAs a result of customers electing CCA and DA services, SDG&E’s historical energy procurement commitments for future deliveries exceed the needs of its remaining bundled customers. To help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference (as to whether customers’ energy is procured by SDG&E or by CCA or DA), the CPUC revised the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment framework. The framework is intended to more equitably allocate SDG&E’s procurement cost obligations among customers served by SDG&E and customers now served by CCA and DA.\nSan Diego’s mild climate and SDG&E’s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers. Rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by SDG&E. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in SDG&E’s territory totaled 2,318 MW, 2,154 MW and 1,864 MW, respectively.\nElectricity demand is dependent on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, renewable power generation, the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, demand-side management impact and DER. California’s energy policy supports increased electrification, particularly electrification of vehicles, which could significantly increase sales volumes in the coming years. Other external factors, such as the price of purchased power, the use and further development of renewable energy sources and energy storage, the development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for and supply of natural gas and general economic conditions, can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity, which may in turn impact demand. Electricity demand is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns (or “seasonality”), tending to increase in the summer months to meet the cooling load and in the winter months to meet the heating load.\nCompetition. \nSDG&E faces competition to serve its customer load from distributed and local power generation growth, including DER. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with SDG&E’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. Certain FERC transmission development projects are open to competition, allowing independent developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  15\nTable of Contents\nSoCalGas\nSoCalGas is a regulated public utility that owns and operates a natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system that delivers natural gas to a population of, at December 31, 2024, approximately 21.1 million, covering an approximate 24,000 square mile service territory that encompasses Southern California and portions of central California (excluding San Diego County, the City of Long Beach and the desert area of San Bernardino County).\nSoCalGas’ assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory:\nWe describe SoCalGas’ natural gas utility operations below in “Sempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations.” For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing SoCalGas’ business, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California.”\nSempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations\nNatural Gas Procurement and Transportation. \nAt December 31, 2024, SoCalGas’ natural gas facilities included 3,037 miles of transmission and storage pipelines, 52,567 miles of distribution pipelines, 48,999 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations, and SDG&E’s natural gas facilities consisted of 188 miles of transmission pipelines, 9,201 miles of distribution pipelines, 6,794 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station.\nSoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s gas transmission pipelines interconnect with four major interstate pipeline systems: El Paso Natural Gas, Transwestern Pipeline, Kern River Pipeline Company, and Mojave Pipeline Company, allowing customers to bring gas supplies into the SoCalGas gas transmission pipeline system from the various out-of-state gas producing basins. Additionally, an interconnection with PG&E’s intrastate gas transmission pipeline system allows gas to flow into SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system. SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system also has an interconnect with a Mexican gas pipeline company at Otay Mesa on the California/Mexico border that allows gas to not only flow south from the gas producing basins in the southwestern U.S., but to also flow north into SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system from supplies in Mexico. There are also several in-state gas interconnections allowing for delivery of California-produced gas, including a number of direct connections from biomethane producers.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  16\nTable of Contents\nSoCalGas purchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts and on the spot market for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from various sources, including from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern regions of the U.S. Purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid week indices, which can be subject to volatility. The cost of purchases of natural gas for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core customers is billed to those customers without markup.\nTo support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the needs of customers, SoCalGas has firm and variable interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed and variable tariffed and negotiated reservation charges to reserve firm and interruptible transportation rights. Energy companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas.\nNatural Gas Storage. \nSoCalGas owns four natural gas storage facilities with a combined working gas capacity of 137 Bcf and 126 injection, withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage service. SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s core customers, along with certain third-party market participants, are allocated a portion of SoCalGas’ storage capacity. SoCalGas uses the remaining storage capacity for load balancing services for all customers and for storage for noncore customers. Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods, including consumer heating needs in the winter, as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility has a storage capacity of 86 Bcf and, subject to CPUC limitations, represents 63% of SoCalGas’ working natural gas storage capacity. At December 31, 2024, SoCalGas has been authorized by the CPUC to utilize up to 68.6 Bcf of working gas at the facility.\nCustomers and Demand. \nSoCalGas and SDG&E sell, distribute and transport natural gas. SoCalGas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers in its territory and SDG&E’s territory on a combined portfolio basis. SoCalGas also offers natural gas transportation and storage services for others.\nNATURAL GAS CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES\nCustomer meter count\nVolumes (Bcf)\n(1)\nDecember 31,\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSDG&E:\nResidential\n886,031 \nCommercial\n29,009 \nElectric generation and transportation\n3,312 \nNatural gas sales\n45 \n48 \n45 \nTransportation\n38 \n39 \n39 \nTotal\n918,352 \n83 \n87 \n84 \nSoCalGas:\nResidential\n5,940,904 \nCommercial \n248,866 \nIndustrial\n23,833 \nElectric generation and wholesale\n38 \nNatural gas sales\n304 \n321 \n304 \nTransportation\n522 \n549 \n586 \nTotal\n6,213,641 \n826 \n870 \n890 \n(1)\n    \nIncludes intercompany sales.\nFor regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers.\nMost core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG&E. While core customers are permitted to purchase their natural gas supplies from producers, marketers or brokers, SoCalGas and SDG&E are obligated to maintain adequate delivery capacity to serve the requirements of all their core customers. \nSoCalGas’ noncore customers consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, and large commercial and industrial customers. A portion of SoCalGas’ noncore customers are non-end-users, which include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other utilities, including SDG&E, or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems. Noncore customers at SDG&E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  17\nTable of Contents\nNoncore customers are responsible for procuring their natural gas requirements, as the regulatory framework does not allow SoCalGas and SDG&E to recover the cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers.\nNatural gas demand largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, California’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. Other external factors such as weather, the price of, demand for, and supply sources of electricity, the use of and further development of renewable energy sources and energy storage, development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for natural gas outside California, storage levels, transport capacity and availability of supply into California and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of natural gas, which may in turn impact demand.\nOne of the larger drivers of natural gas demand is electric generation. Natural gas-fired electric generation within Southern California (and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants) competes with electric power generated throughout the western U.S. Natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity, growth in self-generation from rooftop solar, the addition of more efficient gas technologies, new energy efficiency initiatives, and the degree to which regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s service areas. The demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to seasonality, weather conditions and other impacts, and the availability of competing supplies of electricity, such as renewable energy sources. Given the significant level and availability of natural gas-fired generation, we believe natural gas is a dispatchable fuel that can continue to help provide electric reliability in our California service territories.\nThe natural gas distribution business is subject to seasonality. Demand for natural gas in our service territory typically rises during the winter months to accommodate heating needs and the summer months to support peak electric generation. As is prevalent in the industry, subject to regulatory limitations, SoCalGas typically injects natural gas into storage during the months of April through October and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the months of November through March.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  18\nTable of Contents\nSempra Texas Utilities \nSempra Texas Utilities is comprised of our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings and Sharyland Holdings. Oncor Holdings is a wholly owned entity of Sempra that owns an 80.25% interest in Oncor. TTI owns the remaining 19.75% interest in Oncor. Sempra owns a 50% interest in Sharyland Holdings, which owns a 100% interest in Sharyland Utilities.\nSempra Texas Utilities’ assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory: \nFor a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings and Sharyland Holdings, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Texas Utilities.”\nOncor\nOncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution utility that operates in the north-central, eastern, western and panhandle regions of Texas. Oncor delivers electricity to end-use consumers through its electrical systems and also provides transmission grid connections to merchant generation facilities and interconnections to other transmission grids in Texas. Oncor’s transmission and distribution assets are located in over 120 counties and more than 400 incorporated municipalities, including the \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  19\nTable of Contents\ncities of Dallas and Fort Worth and surrounding suburbs, as well as Waco, Wichita Falls, Odessa, Midland, Tyler, Temple, Killeen and Round Rock, among others. Most of Oncor’s power lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways, streets and rights-of-way pursuant to permits, public utility easements, franchise or other agreements or as otherwise permitted by law. \nAt December 31, 2024, Oncor had 5,094 employees, including 836 employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement and excluding interns.\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, which we describe in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” are in effect and are intended to enhance Oncor Holdings’ and Oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of, or other adverse financial developments affecting, their owners. Sempra does not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends or other distributions, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions, including limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors. Because Oncor Holdings and Oncor are managed independently (i.e., ring-fenced), we account for our 100% ownership interest in Oncor Holdings as an equity method investment.\nElectricity Transmission.\n \nOncor’s electricity transmission business is responsible for the safe and reliable operations of its transmission network and substations. These responsibilities consist of the construction, maintenance and security of transmission facilities and substations and the monitoring, controlling and dispatching of high-voltage electricity over its transmission facilities in coordination with ERCOT, which we discuss below in “Regulation – Utility Regulation – ERCOT Market.” \nAt December 31, 2024, Oncor’s transmission system included approximately 18,324 circuit miles of transmission lines, a total of 1,288 transmission and distribution substations, and interconnection to 192 third-party generation facilities totaling 58,597 MW. \nTransmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by either the PUCT or, to a small degree related to limited interconnection to other markets, the FERC. Network transmission revenues compensate Oncor for delivery of electricity over transmission facilities operating at 60 kV and above. Other services offered by Oncor through its transmission business include system impact studies, facilities studies, transformation service and maintenance of transformer equipment, substations and transmission lines owned by other parties. \nElectricity Distribution. \nOncor’s electricity distribution business is responsible for the overall safe and reliable operation of distribution facilities, including electricity delivery, power quality, security and system reliability. These responsibilities consist of the ownership, management, construction, maintenance and operation of the electricity distribution system within its certificated service area. Oncor’s distribution system receives electricity from the transmission system through substations and distributes electricity to end-users and wholesale customers through 3,757 distribution feeders at December 31, 2024.\nOncor’s distribution system included more than four million points of delivery at December 31, 2024 and consisted of 125,975 circuit miles of overhead and underground lines.\nDistribution revenues from residential and small business users are generally based on actual monthly consumption (kWh) and distribution revenues from large commercial and industrial users are based on, depending on size and annual load factor, either actual monthly demand (kW) or the greater of actual monthly demand (kW) or 80% of peak monthly demand during the prior eleven months. \nCustomers and Demand. \nOncor operates the largest transmission and distribution system in Texas based on the number of end-use customers and miles of transmission and distribution lines, delivering electricity to more than four million homes and businesses, operating more than 144,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines as of December 31, 2024 in a territory with an estimated population of approximately 13 million. The majority of consumers of the electricity Oncor delivers are free to choose their electricity supplier from retail electric providers who compete for their business. Oncor is not a seller of electricity, nor does it purchase electricity for resale. Rather, Oncor provides wholesale transmission services to its electricity distribution business as well as non-affiliated electricity distribution companies, electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. Oncor also provides distribution services, consisting of retail delivery services to retail electric providers that sell electricity to end-use customers, as well as wholesale delivery services to electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. At December 31, 2024, Oncor’s distribution business customers primarily consisted of over 100 retail electric providers that sell the electricity it distributes to consumers in its certificated service areas.\nOncor’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other electricity usage drivers, with revenues being highest in the summer. \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  20\nTable of Contents\nCompetition.\n Oncor operates in certificated areas designated by the PUCT. The majority of Oncor’s service territory is single certificated, with Oncor as the only certificated electric transmission and distribution provider. However, in multi-certificated areas of Texas, Oncor competes with certain other utilities and rural electric cooperatives for the right to serve end-use customers. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party DER and other technologies may increasingly compete with Oncor’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers.\nSharyland Utilities\nSharyland Utilities is a regulated electric transmission utility that owns and operates, at December 31, 2024, approximately 64 miles of electric transmission lines in south Texas, including a direct current line connecting Mexico and assets in McAllen, Texas. Sharyland Utilities is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient transmission and substation services and investing to support infrastructure needs in its service territory, which we discuss below in “Regulation – Utility Regulation – ERCOT Market.” Transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the PUCT.\nSempra Infrastructure\nOur Sempra Infrastructure segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary, SI Partners, as well as a holding company and certain services companies. SI Partners is included within our Sempra Infrastructure reportable segment but is not the same in its entirety as the reportable segment. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in energy infrastructure to help provide safe, sustainable and reliable access to cleaner energy in markets in the U.S., Mexico and globally.\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra, KKR Pinnacle and ADIA each hold a 70%, 20%, and 10% interest, respectively, in SI Partners. SI Partners owns a 100% interest in Sempra LNG Holding, LP and a 99.9% interest in IEnova at December 31, 2024. \nThe minority partners in SI Partners and Sempra are parties to the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of SI Partners (the LP Agreement). Under the LP Agreement, matters are decided generally by majority vote and the managers designated by the partners of SI Partners each vote on an equity-weighted basis based on the ownership percentage of their respective designating limited partner. SI Partners and its controlled subsidiaries are prohibited from taking certain limited actions without the prior written approval of the minority partners. The LP Agreement contains certain default remedies if any limited partner fails to fund any amounts required to be funded under the LP Agreement and requires that SI Partners distribute to the limited partners at least 85% of distributable cash of SI Partners and its subsidiaries on a quarterly basis, subject to certain exceptions and reserves. Generally, distributions from SI Partners are made on a pro rata basis. However, KKR Pinnacle is entitled to certain priority distributions in the event of material deviations between certain specified projected cash flows and actual cash flows. Additionally, the minority partners are entitled to certain priority distributions in the event a specified project that reaches a positive final investment decision does not have projected internal rates of return greater than a specified threshold or in the event Sempra has not made a positive final investment decision by a certain date on specified LNG projects that are under development. Under the LP Agreement, if the minority partners approve Sempra’s request that a project not be pursued jointly, or if the minority partners decide not to participate in any proposed project for which Sempra nevertheless desires to make a positive final investment decision, then Sempra may proceed with such project either independently through a different investment vehicle or as a “Sole Risk Project” within SI Partners and receive Sole Risk Interests in respect thereof. Sole Risk Projects are separated from other SI Partners projects and are conducted at Sempra’s sole cost, expense and liability, and Sempra receives, through the acquisition of Sole Risk Interests, the economic and other benefits, if any, from such projects.\nSempra Infrastructure consolidates Sempra’s ownership and management of its non-U.S. utility, energy infrastructure assets in North America under a single platform. These assets include LNG and natural gas infrastructure in the U.S. and Mexico and renewable energy, LPG and refined products infrastructure in Mexico, which are managed through three business lines: LNG, Energy Networks and Low Carbon Solutions.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  21\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure owned or held interests in the following assets:\nFor a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing Sempra Infrastructure’s business, see “Part 1 – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure.”\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  22\nTable of Contents\nLNG\nSempra Infrastructure’s LNG business line is comprised of a natural gas liquefaction and regasification portfolio in operation, construction or development, and is focused on securely delivering natural gas to markets around the world. Sempra Infrastructure’s development and/or construction of projects, which we describe below, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nCameron LNG Phase 1 Facility.\n SI Partners owns 50.2% of Cameron LNG JV, resulting in Sempra Infrastructure holding a 35.1% interest in the JV. An affiliate of TotalEnergies SE, an affiliate of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and Japan LNG Investment, LLC (a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha) each own 16.6% of Cameron LNG JV. We account for our ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. No single owner controls or can unilaterally direct significant activities of Cameron LNG JV.\nCameron LNG JV owns and operates the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility, a natural gas liquefaction, export, regasification and import facility with three natural gas pre-treatment, processing and liquefaction trains. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility is located in Hackberry, Louisiana, along the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which handles significant industrial shipping, including large oil and LNG tankers, that we believe is well positioned to supply the Atlantic and Pacific markets. The three liquefaction trains have a combined nameplate capacity of 13.9 Mtpa of LNG with an export capacity of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf of natural gas per day. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of TotalEnergies SE, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., which collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the three trains at the facility.\nECA Regas Facility.\n SI Partners owns and operates the ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico, which is capable of processing one Bcf of natural gas per day and has a storage capacity of 320,000 cubic meters in two tanks of 160,000 cubic meters each.\nThe ECA Regas Facility generates revenues from firm storage service fees under firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell and SEFE that expire in May 2028 and December 2025, respectively, which permit them to collectively use 50% of the terminal’s capacity, with the remaining 50% of the capacity available for Sempra Infrastructure’s use. The land on which the ECA Regas Facility and the ECA LNG liquefaction projects under construction and in development are expected to be situated, as well as land adjacent to those properties, are the subject of litigation. We discuss litigation, regulatory and other matters that could impact the ECA Regas Facility and the ECA LNG liquefaction projects in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” \nSempra Infrastructure uses its 50% capacity at the ECA Regas Facility to satisfy its obligation under an LNG SPA with Tangguh PSC through 2029, which we discuss below, and ECA LNG Phase 1 will be the sole user of this capacity thereafter.\nECA LNG Phase 1 Project.\n SI Partners owns an 83.4% interest in ECA LNG Phase 1, resulting in Sempra Infrastructure holding a 58.4% interest in the project. An affiliate of TotalEnergies SE owns the remaining 16.6% interest in the project. ECA LNG Phase 1 is constructing a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of Sempra Infrastructure’s existing ECA Regas Facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 2.5 Mtpa. We expect the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in the spring of 2026.\nECA LNG Phase 1 has definitive 20-year SPAs with an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE for approximately 1.7 Mtpa of LNG and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. for approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG.\nPA LNG Phase 1 Project. \nSI Partners, KKR Denali and an affiliate of ConocoPhillips own a 28%, 42% and 30% interest, respectively, in the PA LNG Phase 1 project under construction on a greenfield site in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas, located along the Sabine-Neches waterway. Sempra Infrastructure holds a 19.6% interest in the project. The PA LNG Phase 1 project will consist of two liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks, a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of approximately 10.5 Mtpa. We expect the first and second trains of the PA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nPA LNG Phase 1 has definitive SPAs with an affiliate of ConocoPhillips for a 20-year term for 5 Mtpa of LNG, RWE Supply & Trading GmbH for a 15-year term for 2.25 Mtpa of LNG, INEOS for a 20-year term for approximately 1.4 Mtpa of LNG, ORLEN for a 20-year term for approximately 1 Mtpa of LNG, and ENGIE S.A. for a 15-year term for approximately 0.875 Mtpa of LNG.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  23\nTable of Contents\nKKR Denali’s interest in the PA LNG Phase 1 project is governed by a limited liability company agreement under which (i) a subsidiary of SI Partners (a) is the managing member, (b) exclusively holds the right to make decisions with respect to certain expansions, such as the potential PA LNG Phase 2 project, (c) has certain rights to preferential distributions from specified revenues and expansion true-up payments, and (d) through a parent entity that is a subsidiary of Sempra, bears a disproportionately higher allocation of certain capital contribution commitments in certain budgetary overrun scenarios, and (ii) KKR Denali has certain investor protection voting rights.\nAsset and Supply Optimization.\n Sempra Infrastructure has an LNG SPA through 2029 with Tangguh PSC for the supply of the equivalent of 500 MMcf of natural gas per day at a price based on the SoCal Border index for natural gas. The LNG SPA allows Tangguh PSC to divert certain LNG volumes to other global markets in exchange for payments of diversion fees. Sempra Infrastructure may also enter into short-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified at the ECA Regas Facility for sale to other parties. Sempra Infrastructure uses the natural gas produced from this LNG to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to the CFE at prices that are based on the SoCal Border index. If LNG volumes received from Tangguh PSC are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the CFE, Sempra Infrastructure may purchase natural gas in the market to satisfy such commitment.\nSempra Infrastructure purchases, transports and sells natural gas and LNG, and has customers in both the U.S. and Mexico, including the CFE. Sempra Infrastructure may also purchase natural gas from other Sempra affiliates. Natural gas purchases and transportation arrangements are substantially backed by long-term, U.S. dollar-based contracts for the sale of natural gas to third parties (both U.S. sourced and derived from imported LNG), LNG offtake and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity.\nLNG Projects Under Development.\n Sempra Infrastructure is pursuing or evaluating the following development opportunities:\n▪\nCameron LNG Phase 2 project, an expansion of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility that would add one liquefaction train and debottlenecking capacity from the existing three trains\n▪\nECA LNG Phase 2 project, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project to be located at the site of Sempra Infrastructure’s existing ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico\n▪\nPA LNG Phase 2 project, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project and associated infrastructure to be located adjacent to the PA LNG Phase 1 project in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas\n▪\nVista Pacifico LNG project, a mid-scale natural gas liquefaction project and associated infrastructure in the vicinity of Topolobampo in Sinaloa, Mexico\nNo final investment decision has been reached for any of these potential projects.\nDemand and Competition.\n North America benefits from numerous competitive advantages as a potential supplier of LNG to world markets, including the following:\n▪\nhigh levels of developed and undeveloped natural gas resources, including unconventional natural gas and oil relative to domestic consumption levels\n▪\nflexible and mature oil and gas markets resulting in efficient unit costs of gas production\n▪\navailability of extensive natural gas pipeline transmission systems and natural gas storage capacity with proximity to production locations\nGlobal LNG demand and competition may limit North American LNG exports, as international liquefaction projects attempt to match North American LNG production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility. North American LNG exports add market flexibility that is expected to facilitate additional growth of a global commodity market for natural gas and LNG.\nOur LNG projects in development, under construction and in operation all compete globally to market and sell LNG to remarketers and end-users, including gas and electric utilities located in LNG-importing countries around the world. We compete with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global LNG market. In addition to the U.S., these competitors are located in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, Australia and Europe. \nEnergy Networks\n \nSempra Infrastructure’s Energy Networks business line is comprised of a natural gas transportation and distribution network.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  24\nTable of Contents\nCross-Border Interconnections and In-Country Pipelines.\n Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in systems for the receipt, transportation, compression and delivery of natural gas and ethane. At December 31, 2024, these systems consisted of 1,985 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, 17 natural gas compression stations and 139 miles of ethane pipelines in Mexico. The design capacity of these pipeline assets is over 16,900 MMcf per day of natural gas, 204 MMcf per day of ethane gas and 106,000 barrels per day of ethane liquid. Capacity on Sempra Infrastructure’s pipelines and related assets is substantially contracted under long-term, U.S. dollar-based agreements with major industry participants such as the CFE, Centro Nacional de Control de Gas, PEMEX and other similar counterparties. See “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure” for a discussion about Sempra Infrastructure’s Sonora pipeline.\nSempra Infrastructure owns a 40-mile natural gas pipeline in south Louisiana, the Cameron Interstate Pipeline, which links the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility in Cameron Parish in Louisiana to seven pipelines that offer access to major feed gas supply basins in Texas and the northeast, midcontinent and southeast regions of the U.S. The majority of transportation capacity on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline is under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers for delivery to the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility.\nSempra Infrastructure is constructing the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector, a 72-mile pipeline connecting the PA LNG Phase 1 project to Gillis, Louisiana. We expect the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector to be ready for service ahead of the PA LNG Phase 1 project’s gas requirements.\nNatural Gas Distribution.\n Sempra Infrastructure owns the natural gas distribution regulated utility, Ecogas, which operates in three separate distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico. At December 31, 2024, Ecogas had approximately 3,142 miles of distribution pipeline, and approximately 163,000 customer meters serving more than 628,000 residential, commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately 10 MMcf per day in 2024. Ecogas relies on supply and transportation services, including from Sempra Infrastructure and SoCalGas for the natural gas it distributes to its customers.\nLPG Storage and Associated Systems.\n Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TDF, S. de R. L. de C. V. (TDF) pipeline system and the Guadalajara LPG terminal. At December 31, 2024, the TDF pipeline system consisted of approximately 118 miles of 12-inch diameter LPG pipeline with a design capacity of 34,000 barrels per day and associated storage and dispatch facilities. The TDF pipeline system runs from PEMEX’s Burgos facility in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Mexico to Sempra Infrastructure’s approximately 32,000-barrel LPG storage facility near the city of Monterrey, Mexico and is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2027. Sempra Infrastructure’s Guadalajara LPG terminal is an 80,000-barrel LPG storage facility near Guadalajara, Mexico, with associated loading and dispatch facilities, and serves the LPG needs of Guadalajara. The Guadalajara LPG terminal is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2028. Both contracts are U.S. dollar-denominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for inflation.\nRefined Products and Natural Gas Storage.\n Sempra Infrastructure’s refined products storage business develops, constructs and operates systems for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products, principally gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, throughout the Mexican states of Baja California, Colima, Estado de Mexico, Puebla, Sinaloa and Veracruz for private companies, with a combined storage capacity of 4.6 million barrels fully operating as of December 31, 2024. The Topolobampo marine terminal commenced commercial operations in June 2024. Our customer contracts for our refined products storage business are structured as long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated, firm capacity storage agreements with counterparties including Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation and PEMEX. The contracted rate under these contracts is independent from each terminal’s regulated rate as determined by the CRE.\nSempra Infrastructure is constructing Louisiana Storage, a 12.5-Bcf salt dome natural gas storage facility to support the PA LNG Phase 1 project. The construction includes an 11-mile pipeline that will connect to the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. We expect Louisiana Storage to be ready for service in time to support the needs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project.\nDemand and Competition.\n Ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems. Sempra Infrastructure’s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipeline and storage facilities. They compete primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets. The overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months, while the overall demand for power increases during the summer months.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  25\nTable of Contents\nLow Carbon Solutions \nSempra Infrastructure’s Low Carbon Solutions business line is focused on commercializing and deploying low carbon solutions in support of meeting the demand for lower carbon and reliable energy supply. The portfolio of resources includes renewable energy infrastructure, a natural gas-fired power plant, as well as potential hydrogen fuel production and advanced carbon capture, usage and storage technologies that are under development. \nRenewable Power Generation.\n Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have long-term PPAs to sell the electricity they generate to their customers, which are generally load-serving entities, as well as industrial and other customers. Load serving entities sell electric service to their end-users and wholesale customers upon receipt of power delivery from these energy generation facilities, while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities. At December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure had total nameplate capacity of 1,044 MW related to its operating wind and solar power generation facilities. Generation from Sempra Infrastructure’s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, inclement weather and hours of sunlight. Additionally, some of these facilities are impacted by regulatory actions by the Mexican government and related litigation, which we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure.”\nRENEWABLE POWER GENERATION\nLocation\nContract expiration date\nNameplate capacity (MW)\nWind power generation facilities:\nESJ – first phase\nTecate, Baja California\n2035\n155 \nESJ – second phase\nTecate, Baja California\n2042\n108 \nVentika\nNuevo León, Mexico\n2036\n252 \nSolar power generation facilities:\nBorder Solar\nCiudad Juarez, Chihuahua\n2032 and 2037\n150 \nDon Diego Solar\nBenjamin Hill, Sonora\n2034 and 2037\n125 \nPima Solar\nCaborca, Sonora\n2038\n110 \nRumorosa Solar\nTecate, Baja California\n2034\n44 \nTepezalá Solar\nAguascalientes\n2034\n100 \nTotal\n1,044 \nNatural Gas-Fired Generation.\n Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TdM power plant in the vicinity of Mexicali, Baja California, adjacent to the Mexico-U.S. border. TdM is a 625 MW natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant that is connected to our Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system, which enables it to receive regasified LNG from the ECA Regas Facility as well as continental gas supplied from the U.S. on the North Baja pipeline. TdM generates revenue from selling electricity and resource adequacy to the California ISO for delivery to governmental, public utility and wholesale power marketing entities.\nLow Carbon Solutions Projects.\n Sempra Infrastructure is constructing the Cimarrón Wind project, an approximately 320 MW wind generation facility in Baja California, Mexico. Sempra Infrastructure has a 20-year PPA with Silicon Valley Power for the long-term supply of renewable energy to the City of Santa Clara, California. Cimarrón Wind will utilize Sempra Infrastructure’s existing cross-border high voltage transmission line to interconnect and deliver clean energy to the East County substation in San Diego County. We expect the Cimarrón Wind project to begin generating energy in late 2025 and commence commercial operations in the first half of 2026. \nSempra Infrastructure is also evaluating the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration development opportunity, which is a carbon capture and sequestration project that is intended to reduce emissions at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project.\nDemand and Competition. \nSempra Infrastructure competes with Mexican and foreign companies for new energy infrastructure projects in Mexico. Some of its competitors (including public or state-operated companies and their affiliates) may have better access to capital or greater financial and other resources or advantages, which could give them a competitive advantage for such projects.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  26\nTable of Contents\nSempra Infrastructure sells power from its ESJ wind power facility into California, where renewable energy demand is affected by U.S. state mandates requiring a portion of energy to come from renewable sources. These mandates are part of California’s RPS Program. The first and second phases of ESJ, which are in operation, were certified by the CEC under the RPS Program. Certification by the CEC means that the energy produced by a facility can be counted towards the RPS Program requirements, which in turn affects the demand from California load serving entities for energy from that facility. In January 2025, the CEC approved Cimarrón Wind’s application for precertification under the RPS Program.\nTdM competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the California electricity market. Sempra Infrastructure manages commodity price risk at TdM by using a mix of day ahead sales of energy, energy spreads hedging, ancillary services, and short-term to medium-term capacity sales.\nREGULATION\nWe discuss the material effects of compliance with all government regulations, including environmental regulations, on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUtility Regulation\nCalifornia\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are principally regulated at the state level by the CPUC, CEC and CARB.\nThe CPUC:\n▪\nconsists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms;\n▪\nregulates, among other things, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in “U.S. Federal;”\n▪\nhas jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation, transmission and distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California;\n▪\nconducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations related to various matters, such as safety, reliability and planning, deregulation, competition and the environment; and\n▪\nregulates the interactions and transactions of SDG&E and SoCalGas with Sempra and other affiliates, including their marketing functions.\nThe CPUC also oversees and regulates other energy-related products and services, including solar and wind energy, bioenergy, alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy. In addition, the CPUC’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections, investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety and other violations.\nThe CEC publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and specific service territories. Based on these forecasts, the CEC:\n▪\ndetermines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs;\n▪\nsponsors alternative-energy research and development projects;\n▪\npromotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand for natural gas and electricity within California;\n▪\nmaintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and\n▪\ncertifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California.\nThe CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead prices, and transportation and distribution costs. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ long-term investment decisions.\nWe discuss regulatory oversight by CARB below in “Environmental Matters – Air Quality and GHG Emissions.”\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  27\nTable of Contents\nTexas\nOncor’s and Sharyland Utilities’ rates are regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities. The PUCT has original jurisdiction over wholesale transmission rates and services and retail rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the PUCT, and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the retail rates, retail services, and ordinances of municipalities. Generally, the Texas PURA prohibits the collection of any rates or charges by a public utility (as defined by PURA) that do not have the prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authority (i.e., the PUCT or the municipality with original jurisdiction). \nAt the state level, PURA requires utility owners or operators of electric transmission facilities to provide open-access wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility’s own use of its system. The PUCT has adopted rules implementing the state open-access requirements for all utilities that are subject to the PUCT’s jurisdiction over electric transmission services, including Oncor. \nU.S. Federal\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are also regulated at the federal level by the FERC, the EPA, the DOE and the DOT, and for SDG&E the NRC.\nThe FERC regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC also regulates SDG&E’s transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates of return and rates of depreciation on transmission investment, electric rates involving sales for resale and the application of the uniform system of accounts. The U.S. Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for electric transmission service. The California IOUs’ electric transmission facilities are under the operational control of the California ISO. As member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which we discuss below. To a small degree related to limited interconnections to other markets, Oncor’s electric transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the FERC.\nThe NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the U.S., including SONGS, in which SDG&E owns a 20% interest, and which permanently ceased operations in 2013. The NRC and various state regulations require extensive review of these facilities’ safety, radiological and environmental aspects. We provide further discussion of SONGS matters, including the closure and decommissioning of the facility, in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe EPA implements federal laws to protect human health and the environment, including federal laws on air quality, water quality, wastewater discharge, solid waste management, and hazardous waste disposal and remediation. The EPA also sets national environmental standards that state and tribal governments implement through their regulations. As a result, SDG&E, SoCalGas, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to an interrelated framework of environmental laws and regulations.\nThe DOT, through PHMSA, has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures, including procedures intended to manage cybersecurity risks, applicable to SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, as well as natural gas storage facilities. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California. \nERCOT Market\nAs member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which represents approximately 90% of the electricity consumption in Texas. ERCOT is the regional reliability coordinating organization for member electricity systems in Texas and the ISO of the interconnected transmission grid for those systems. ERCOT is subject to oversight by the PUCT and the Texas Legislature. ERCOT is responsible for ensuring reliability, adequacy and security of the electric systems, as well as nondiscriminatory access to transmission service by all wholesale market participants, in the ERCOT region. ERCOT’s membership consists of corporate and associate members, including electric cooperatives, municipal power agencies, independent generators, independent power marketers, transmission service providers, distribution service providers, independent retail electric providers and consumers. \nThe PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas’ main interconnected electric transmission grid. Oncor and Sharyland Utilities, along with other owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities in Texas, assist the ERCOT ISO in its operations. Each of these Texas utilities has planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance and security responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and the load-serving substations it owns, primarily within its certificated distribution service area. Each participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities in obtaining regulatory approvals and planning, designing, constructing and upgrading transmission lines in order to remove any existing constraints and interconnect energy generation on the ERCOT transmission grid. These transmission line projects are necessary to meet reliability needs, support energy production and increase bulk power transfer capability. \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  28\nTable of Contents\nOncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to reliability standards adopted and enforced by the Texas Reliability Entity, Inc., an independent organization that develops reliability standards for the ERCOT region and monitors and enforces compliance with the standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, including critical infrastructure protection, and ERCOT protocols.\nOther U.S. State and Local Territories Regulation\nSDG&E has electric franchise agreements with the two counties and the 27 cities in its electric service territory, and natural gas franchise agreements with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory. These franchise agreements allow SDG&E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity or natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2028 to 2041. SDG&E has electric and natural gas franchises for the City of San Diego. These franchise agreements, which went into effect in July 2021, provide SDG&E the opportunity to serve the City of San Diego for the next 20 years, consisting of 10-year agreements that will automatically renew for an additional 10 years unless the City Council voids the automatic renewal. These franchise agreements have been challenged in two lawsuits that we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSoCalGas has natural gas franchise agreements with the 12 counties and the 232 cities in its service territory. These franchise agreements allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2026 to 2069. In December 2024, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors granted SoCalGas a new, 20-year gas pipeline franchise. The franchise consists of an initial 10-year term beginning on January 9, 2025, followed by a 10-year term that Los Angeles County has the option to terminate. Prior to the granting of the new franchise, SoCalGas continued to serve customers in the unincorporated territory of Los Angeles County in accordance with its prior franchise.\nOther U.S. Regulation\nThe FERC regulates certain Sempra Infrastructure assets pursuant to the U.S. Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, which provide for FERC jurisdiction over, among other things, sales of wholesale power in interstate commerce, transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting of LNG facilities. \nThe FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. FERC-regulated rates at Sempra Infrastructure are market-based for wholesale electricity sales, cost-based for the transportation of natural gas, and market-based for the purchase and sale of LNG and natural gas.\nSempra Infrastructure’s investment in Cameron LNG JV is subject to regulations of the DOE regarding the export of LNG. Under these regulations, the DOE acts on LNG export applications to non-FTA countries after completing a public interest review that includes several criteria, including economic and environmental review of the proposed export. Sempra Infrastructure’s other potential natural gas liquefaction projects would, if completed, be subject to similar regulations.\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and businesses in which Sempra Infrastructure invests are subject to the DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety. PHMSA, acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety, is responsible for administering the DOT’s national regulatory program to help ensure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines, including pipelines associated with natural gas storage, and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to help ensure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities. PHMSA also regulates the safety of onshore LNG facilities.\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nForeign Regulation\nOperations and projects in our Sempra Infrastructure segment are subject to regulation by the CRE, ASEA, SENER, the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Mexico (Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales), and other labor and environmental agencies of city, state and federal governments in Mexico. New energy infrastructure projects may also require a favorable opinion from Mexico’s Competition Commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica) in order to be constructed and operated. Recent Mexican Constitutional reforms have proposed to transfer significant powers from the CRE to SENER; implementing legislation on these reforms is expected to be forthcoming.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  29\nTable of Contents\nLicenses and Permits\nOur utilities in California and Texas obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for, as applicable, the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets, including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities, some of which may require periodic renewal. \nSempra Infrastructure obtains numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for its electric and natural gas distribution, generation and transmission systems from the local governments where these services are provided. The permits for generation, transportation, storage and distribution operations at Sempra Infrastructure are generally for 30-year terms, with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions. Sempra Infrastructure obtains licenses and permits for the construction, operation and expansion of LNG facilities and for the import and export of LNG and natural gas. Sempra Infrastructure also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of facilities for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products. Sempra Infrastructure obtains permits, authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market. Most of the permits and licenses associated with Sempra Infrastructure’s construction and operations are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or expected useful life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years.\nRATEMAKING MECHANISMS\nSempra\n \nCalifornia\nGeneral Rate Case Proceedings\nA CPUC GRC proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow SDG&E and SoCalGas to recover their reasonable forecasted operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. The proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements and provides for attrition, or annual increases in revenue requirements, for each year following the test year. Both the test year revenue requirements and attrition authorize how much SDG&E and SoCalGas can collect from their customers in base rates.\nWe discuss the GRC in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost of Capital Proceedings \nA CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and return on rate base, which is a weighted average of the authorized returns on debt, preferred equity and common equity (referred to as ROE), weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure. The authorized return on rate base approved by the CPUC is the rate that SDG&E and SoCalGas use to establish customer rates to finance investments in CPUC-regulated electric distribution and generation, natural gas distribution, transmission and storage assets, as well as general PP&E and information technology systems investments to support operations.\nThe CPUC established the CCM to apply in the interim years between required cost of capital applications and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody’s (the CCM benchmark) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). The index applicable to SDG&E and SoCalGas is based on each utility’s credit rating. The CCM benchmark rate is the basis of comparison to determine if the CCM is triggered in each measurement period, which occurs if the change in the applicable Moody’s utility bond index relative to the CCM benchmark rate is larger than plus or minus 1.00% for the measurement period. The CCM, if triggered, would automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized ROE upward or downward by 20% of the difference between the CCM benchmark rate and the applicable Moody’s utility bond index during the measurement period, subject to regulatory approval. Alternatively, each of SDG&E and SoCalGas is permitted to file a cost of capital application to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole.\nWe discuss the cost of capital and CCM in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  30\nTable of Contents\nTransmission Rate Cases\n \nSDG&E files separately with the FERC for its authorized ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. The proceeding establishes a ROE and a formulaic rate whereby rates are determined using (i) a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments, and (ii) a true-up period, similar to balancing account treatment, that is designed to provide earnings equal to SDG&E’s actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment. SDG&E makes annual filings with the FERC to update rates for the following calendar year. SDG&E may also file for ROE incentives that might apply under FERC rules. SDG&E’s debt-to-equity ratio is set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year.\nWe discuss the latest FERC rate matters in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncentive Mechanisms \nSoCalGas is subject to the GCIM and is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties depending on its performance in relation to specific benchmarks. We discuss the GCIM in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Cost-Based Regulatory Recovery\nThe CPUC, and the FERC as it relates to SDG&E, authorize SDG&E and SoCalGas to collect, or in the case of CPUC programmatic activities, to apply for additional, revenue requirements beyond base rates from customers for certain operating and capital related costs (depreciation, taxes and return on rate base), including for: \n▪\ncosts to purchase natural gas and electricity; \n▪\ncosts associated with administering public purpose, demand response, environmental compliance, and customer energy efficiency programs; \n▪\nother programmatic activities, such as gas distribution, gas transmission, gas storage integrity management and wildfire mitigation; and\n▪\ncosts associated with third party liability insurance premiums.\nAuthorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered. To the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs, the differences are generally recovered or refunded in a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism. In general, the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met when the costs are incurred. Because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism, changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues. The CPUC and the FERC may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund of amounts accumulated for authorized programs, including limitations on the program’s total cost, revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness. These procedures could result in delays or disallowances of recovery from customers.\nSempra Texas Utilities\nRates and Cost Recovery \nOncor’s and Sharyland Utilities’ rates are each regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities, and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide assurance as to achievement of earnings levels or recovery of actual costs. Instead, their rates are based on an analysis of each utility’s costs and capital structure in a designated test year, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of the Texas utilities’ costs to have been prudently incurred and therefore fully recoverable. The approved levels and timing of recovery could differ significantly from requested levels and timing. There can also be no assurance that the PUCT will approve any other items requested in any rate proceeding or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will necessarily result in rates that produce full recovery of the Texas utilities’ actual post-test year costs and/or the full return on invested capital allowed by the PUCT, particularly during periods of increased capital spending, high inflation or increases in interest rates resulting in increased costs relative to the utility’s most recent base rate review.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  31\nTable of Contents\nPUCT rules provide that a transmission and distribution utility must file a comprehensive base rate review within four years of the last order in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding unless an extension is otherwise approved by the PUCT. However, the PUCT or any city retaining original jurisdiction over rates may direct the utility to file a base rate review, or the utility may voluntarily file a base rate review, any time prior to that deadline. Pursuant to these rules, Oncor’s next base rate review must be filed no later than June 2027. \nWe discuss Oncor’s most recent comprehensive base rate proceeding in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Texas Utilities.”\nSharyland Utilities’ 2020 rate case became effective in July 2021 and remains effective until the next rate case is finalized, which we expect could be in late 2025.\nIn addition, PUCT rules allow Texas electric utilities providing wholesale or retail distribution service to file up to two interim rate adjustment applications per year to recover distribution-related investments placed into service between base rate review proceedings. PUCT rules also allow the Texas utilities to file up to two interim rate adjustment applications per year to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital. These applications for interim rate adjustments between base rate reviews, known as “capital tracker” provisions, are intended to encourage transmission and distribution investments in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by helping to shorten the time period between a utility’s investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure and its ability to start recovering and earning a return on such investments. However, all investments included in a capital tracker are ultimately subject to prudence review by the PUCT in the next base rate review, after such assets are put into service.\nCapital Structure and Return on Equity \nIn April 2023, the PUCT issued a final order in Oncor’s comprehensive base rate review that set Oncor’s authorized ROE at 9.7%, a decrease from its previously authorized ROE of 9.8%, and maintained Oncor’s authorized regulatory capital structure at 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity.\nSharyland Utilities’ PUCT-authorized ROE is 9.38% and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 60% debt to 40% equity. \nSempra Infrastructure\nEcogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in Mexican pesos. The price Ecogas pays to purchase natural gas, which is based on international price indices, is passed through directly to its customers. The service and distribution fees charged by Ecogas are regulated by the CRE, which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to end-users. Ecogas’ rate case for 2021 through 2025 was approved by the CRE in December 2023. The tariffs operate under a return-on-asset-base model. In the annual tariff adjustment, rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates, and inflation indexing includes separate U.S. and Mexican cost components so that U.S. costs can be included in the final distribution rates.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nWe discuss environmental issues affecting us in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions.\nHazardous Substances\nThe CPUC’s Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism allows California’s IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. For sites that are covered by this mechanism, SDG&E and SoCalGas are permitted to recover in rates 90% of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70% of related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, SDG&E and SoCalGas can retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates.\nWe record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  32\nTable of Contents\nAir Quality and GHG Emissions\nThe natural gas and electric industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and GHG emissions standards. AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing GHG emissions. The law requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emissions reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that reports directly to the Governor’s Office. Sempra Infrastructure is also subject to the rules and regulations of CARB.\nCalifornia requires certain electric retail sellers, including SDG&E, to deliver a significant percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the RPS Program. SB 100 (enacted in 2018) and SB 1020 (enacted in 2022) require each California electric utility, including SDG&E, to procure at least 50% of its annual retail electricity delivered from renewable energy or zero-carbon sources by 2026, 60% by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 95% by 2040. SDG&E expects to be in compliance with these RPS program requirements. State law also requires California’s retail electricity supply to be met with a mix of RPS Program-eligible and zero-carbon sources by 2045 without increasing carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid or allowing resource shuffling, and instructs the CPUC, CEC, CARB and other state agencies to incorporate this requirement into all relevant planning. In addition, AB 1279 (enacted in 2022) requires the State of California to achieve net-zero GHG emissions no later than 2045, and to achieve and maintain net negative GHG emissions thereafter. AB 1279 also directs CARB to address this goal in future scoping plans, which affect major sectors of California’s economy, including energy utilities, transportation, agriculture, construction and manufacturing. Other state climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal include executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles, including SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ light-duty fleet vehicles, to be zero-emission by 2035. \nCalifornia has implemented a biomethane procurement program, whereby IOUs providing gas service in California will procure a portion of the natural gas they deliver from biomethane. The rules governing this program are administered by the CPUC under SB 1440, whereby the proportion of biomethane procured will be phased-in with a state-wide, short-term target in 2025 of 17.6 Bcf per year and a medium-term target in 2030 of 72.8 Bcf per year. SDG&E and SoCalGas are allocated 6.77% and 49.26%, respectively, of the 2025 target, and 7.60% and 52.02%, respectively, of the 2030 target. The CPUC is currently evaluating public comments to inform their review of the pending Renewable Gas Procurement Plans filed by the California gas IOUs and work towards identifying potential enhancements to the biomethane procurement program structure, including areas such as increasing market competition, reducing potential barriers for biomethane producers, streamlining procurement requirements, and improving alignment with regulatory goals.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas generally recover the costs to comply with these standards in rates. We discuss GHG emissions standards, allowances and obligations and RECs in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District is the air pollution control agency responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin in Southern California. The district’s territory covers all of Orange County and the urban portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\nSempra continues to decarbonize its operations with an aim to have net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 and an interim target of 50% scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reductions by 2035 (this interim target applies to Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure’s Mexico (non-LNG) operations and is relative to a 2019 baseline). While the company no longer has a specific goal to achieve net-zero scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050, Sempra continues to advocate for programs and initiatives that support regulatory, consumer and market demand for lower- and zero-carbon energy. Additionally, although SDG&E and SoCalGas continue to support California’s goal to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2045, their respective abilities to achieve their net-zero aspirations, as well as Sempra’s ability to achieve its 2035 and 2050 net-zero aspirations, will depend on the development, commercialization and regulatory acceptance of affordable lower carbon generation resources and cleaner fuels, among other factors. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our net-zero and other climate aims, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nWith respect to our net-zero aims, even in a state of “net-zero,” GHG emissions may still be generated, but with innovation and continued development of new technology and solutions, it could allow an equal amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent to be removed from the atmosphere, resulting in a zero increase in overall net emissions. In addition, for purposes of these net-zero aims, we expect that achievement of net-zero GHG emissions will be determined based on operations in 2050 and GHG emissions will be calculated according to widely accepted emissions reporting guidelines or mandates at that time, and our net-zero aim does not include Oncor, which sets its own goals due to certain ring-fencing measures that limit Sempra’s ability to direct the management or activities of Oncor.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  33\nTable of Contents\nOTHER MATTERS\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nINFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nName\nAge\n(1)\nPositions held over last five years\nTime in position\nSempra:\nJeffrey W.

Schwecke, not currently an executive officer, will assume the role as Chief Operating Officer effective March 1, 2025. \nHuman Capital\nOur ability to advance our mission to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company largely depends on the safety, engagement, and responsible actions of our employees. \nSafety is foundational at Sempra and its subsidiaries. We strive to foster a strong safety culture and reinforce this culture through various policies, programs and systems designed to mitigate the occurrence and extent of safety incidents, including, training programs, benchmarking, review and analysis of safety trends, internal compliance assessments and audits, and sharing lessons learned from safety incidents and near misses across our businesses. Our businesses also engage in safety-related scenario planning and simulation, develop and implement operational contingency plans, and review safety plans and procedures with work crews regularly. We also participate in emergency planning and preparedness in the communities we serve and train critical employees in emergency management and response each year. The SST Committee assists the Sempra board of directors in overseeing the company’s oversight programs and performance related to safety, and our executives’ annual incentive compensation is based in part on safety metrics established by the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the board.\nIn addition, we strive to create a high-performing, inclusive and supportive workplace where employees of all backgrounds and experiences feel valued and respected. We invest in recruiting, developing and retaining high-performing employees who represent the communities we serve, and we provide a range of programs for employees, including internal and external mentoring and leadership training and workshops, employee resource groups, and a benefits package including wellness benefits and a tuition reimbursement program. We also invest in internal communications programs, including in-person and virtual learning and networking opportunities as well as regular executive communications to employees on topics of interest. In addition, we offer a variety of employee community service opportunities, and at our U.S. operations, we support employees’ personal volunteering and charitable giving through the charitable matching program of Sempra Foundation, which was founded and is solely funded by Sempra. Employees participate in annual ethics and compliance training, which includes a review of Sempra’s Code of Business Conduct as well as information about resources such as Sempra’s ethics and compliance helpline. We measure culture and employee engagement through a variety of channels including pulse surveys, suggestion boxes and a biannual engagement survey administered by a third party.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  36\nTable of Contents\nThe table below shows the number of employees for each of the Registrants at December 31, 2024, as well as the number of those employees represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements that generally cover wages, benefits, working conditions and other terms and conditions of employment.

Two ratification votes in late 2024 were not successful. SoCalGas is currently operating under the terms of the expired agreement while the parties continue to negotiate revised terms and seek a positive ratification vote from union members. Until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified by employees, there could be labor disruptions, though we do not anticipate that such labor disruptions would have a material impact on service.\nCOMPANY WEBSITES\nThe Registrants’ website addresses are:\n▪\nSempra – www.sempra.com\n▪\nSDG&E – www.sdge.com\n▪\nSoCalGas – www.socalgas.com\nWe make available free of charge on the Sempra website, and for SDG&E and SoCalGas, via a hyperlink on their websites, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nThe references to our websites in this report are not active hyperlinks and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the websites of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas or any other website referenced herein is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this report or any other document that we file with or furnish to the SEC.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  37\nTable of Contents",

Because changes in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ cost of natural gas and/or electricity are recovered in rates, changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings, other than potential impacts related to the GCIM for SoCalGas that we describe below. In addition to the changes in cost or market prices, natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by the difference between customer billings and recorded or CPUC-authorized amounts. These differences are required to be balanced over time, resulting in over- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts. We discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2024 compared to 2023, the increase in earnings of $99 million (6%) to $1.8 billion was primarily due to:\n▪\n$217 million higher income tax benefits primarily from flow-through items, including higher gas repairs tax benefits, offset by $25 million related to income tax benefits in 2023 from previously unrecognized income tax benefits pertaining to gas repairs expenditures \n▪\n$12 million higher electric transmission margin\n▪\n$12 million higher AFUDC equity\n▪\n$11 million higher net regulatory interest income\n▪\n$9 million higher CPUC base operating margin authorized for 2024, net of operating expenses, including higher authorized cost of capital\nOffset by:\n▪\n$89 million charge in 2024 for amounts relating to the FERC order finding that the TO5 adder refund provision has been triggered, requiring SDG&E to refund customers the California ISO adder retroactively from June 1, 2019, which we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n▪\n$60 million higher net interest expense\n▪\n$15 million impairment from disallowed capital costs in the 2024 GRC FD\nSempra Texas Utilities\nIn 2024 compared to 2023, the increase in earnings of $87 million (13%) to $781 million was primarily due to higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings driven by:\n▪\noverall higher revenues primarily attributable to:\n◦\nrate updates to reflect increases in invested capital\n◦\nupdates to transmission billing units\n◦\ncustomer growth\n◦\nbase rates implemented in May 2023\nOffset by:\n◦\nlower customer consumption primarily attributable to weather\n▪\nwrite-off of rate base disallowances in 2023 resulting from the PUCT’s final order in Oncor’s comprehensive base rate review\nOffset by:\n▪\nhigher interest expense and depreciation expense attributable to increases in invested capital\n▪\nhigher

favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects on our monetary positions in Mexico, comprised of a $263 million favorable impact in 2024 compared to a $236 million unfavorable impact in 2023\n▪\n$61 million favorable impact from $19 million net interest income in 2024 compared to $42 million net interest expense in 2023 primarily due to higher capitalization of interest expense in

swaps related to the PA LNG Phase 1 project\n▪\n$21 million favorable impact from $20 million income tax benefit in 2024 compared to $1 million income tax expense in 2023 primarily from outside basis differences and remeasurement of deferred taxes\nOffset by:\n▪\n$463 million from asset and supply optimization driven by unrealized losses in 2024 compared to unrealized gains in 2023 on commodity

SDG&E and SoCalGas to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the CPUC (referred to as “refundable programs”).\nUtilities: Natural Gas Revenues and Cost of Natural Gas\nOur utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure, which includes Ecogas. Intercompany revenues are eliminated in Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nSDG&E and SoCalGas operate under a regulatory framework that permits the cost of natural gas purchased for core customers to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred and without markup. The GCIM provides for SoCalGas to share in the savings and/or costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly market-based benchmarks. This mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price. Any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between SoCalGas and its core customers. We provide further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  69\nTable of Contents\nUTILITIES: NATURAL GAS REVENUES AND COST OF NATURAL GAS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\nNatural gas revenues:\n \n \nSempra California\n$\n7,083 \n$\n9,425 \n$\n7,792 \nSempra Infrastructure\n78 \n87 \n89 \nSegment totals\n7,161 \n9,512 \n7,881 \nEliminations and adjustments\n(20)\n(17)\n(13)\nTotal\n$\n7,141 \n$\n9,495 \n$\n7,868 \nCost of natural gas\n(1)\n:\n \nSempra California\n$\n1,118 \n$\n3,747 \n$\n2,562 \nSempra Infrastructure\n22 \n8 \n37 \nSegment totals\n1,140 \n3,755 \n2,599 \nEliminations and adjustments\n(8)\n(36)\n4 \nTotal\n$\n1,132 \n$\n3,719 \n$\n2,603 \n(1)    \nExcludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately on Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nIn 2024 compared to 2023, Sempra’s natural gas revenues decreased by $2.4 billion (25%) to $7.1 billion driven by Sempra California, which included:\n▪\n$2.6 billion decrease in cost of natural gas sold, which we discuss below\n▪\n$268 million lower revenues from incremental and balanced capital projects that are now in CPUC-authorized revenues as a result of the 2024 GRC FD, offset by higher authorized cost of capital\n▪\n$79 million lower revenues associated with refundable programs, which are fully offset in O&M\n▪\n$31 million lower franchise fee revenues\n▪\n$7 million lower regulatory awards approved by the CPUC\nOffset by:\n▪\n$372 million higher CPUC-authorized revenues in 2024, including certain incremental and balanced capital projects that are now in CPUC-authorized revenues as a result of the 2024 GRC FD and higher authorized cost of capital\n▪\n$310 million higher regulatory revenues primarily from the release of a tax regulatory liability for gas repairs expenditures as a result of the 2024 GRC FD\n▪\n$26 million lower regulatory revenues in 2023 from the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits pertaining to gas repairs expenditures, which are offset in income tax expense\nIn 2024 compared to 2023, Sempra’s cost of natural gas decreased by $2.6 billion to $1.1 billion driven by Sempra California, which included:\n▪\n$2.4 billion lower average natural gas prices \n▪\n$239 million lower volumes driven by weather\nUtilities: Electric Revenues and Cost of Electric Fuel and Purchased Power\nOur utilities revenues include electric revenues at Sempra California, substantially all of which is at SDG&E.

Our pretax income, however, includes 100% of these entities. If our entities with NCI grow, and if we continue to invest in such entities, the impact on our ETR may become more significant.\nIn April 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting for gas repairs expenditures.

In 2024 compared to 2023, the change in our earnings as a result of foreign currency translation rates was negligible.\nTransactional Impacts\nAlthough the financial statements of most of our Mexican subsidiaries and JVs have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, some transactions may be denominated in the local currency; such transactions are remeasured into U.S. dollars. This remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other income, net, for our consolidated entities and in equity earnings for our JVs.\nWe may utilize cross-currency swaps that exchange our Mexican peso-denominated principal and interest payments into the U.S. dollar and swap Mexican fixed interest rates for U.S. fixed interest rates. The impacts of these cross-currency swaps are offset in OCI and are reclassified from AOCI into earnings through other income, net, and interest expense as settlements occur.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  75\nTable of Contents\nCertain of our Mexican pipelines (namely Los Ramones I and San Fernando at IEnova Pipelines and Los Ramones Norte at TAG Pipelines) generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in Mexico, with contracts denominated in Mexican pesos that are indexed to the U.S. dollar, adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate. The resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into U.S. dollars and the offsetting settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues: energy-related businesses or equity earnings.\n \nIncome statement activities at our foreign operations and their JVs are also impacted by transactional gains and losses, a summary of which is shown in the table below:\nTRANSACTIONAL GAINS (LOSSES) FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INFLATION EFFECTS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nTotal reported amounts\nTransactional\n(losses) gains included\nin reported amounts\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\nOther income, net\n$\n136 \n$\n131 \n$\n24 \n$\n(14)\n$\n6 \n$\n(13)\nIncome tax expense\n(219)\n(490)\n(556)\n336 \n(283)\n(169)\nEquity earnings\n1,609 \n1,481 \n1,498 \n64 \n(68)\n(36)\nNet income\n3,500 \n3,618 \n2,285 \n386 \n(345)\n(218)\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(638)\n(543)\n(146)\n(124)\n110 \n54 \nEarnings attributable to common shares\n2,817 \n3,030 \n2,094 \n262 \n(235)\n(164)\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate and Inflation Impacts on Income Taxes and Related Hedging Activity\n \nOur Mexican subsidiaries have U.S. dollar-denominated cash balances, receivables, payables and debt (monetary assets and liabilities) that are affected by Mexican currency exchange rate movements for Mexican income tax purposes. They also have significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities denominated in the Mexican peso that must be translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. As a result, fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and Mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense, other income, net, and equity earnings. We may use foreign currency derivatives as a means to help manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities, and this derivative activity impacts other income, net. However, we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation. \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  76\nTable of Contents\nWe discuss herein SDG&E’s results of operations and significant changes in earnings, revenues and costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

We believe that these cash flow sources, combined with available funds, will be adequate to fund our operations in both the short-term and long-term, including to:\n▪\nfinance capital expenditures\n▪\nrepay debt\n▪\nfund dividends\n▪\nfund contractual and other obligations and otherwise meet liquidity requirements\n▪\nfund capital contribution requirements\n▪\nfund new business or asset acquisitions\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas currently have reasonable access to the money markets and capital markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow or otherwise raise money at market rates from commercial banks, under existing revolving credit facilities, through public offerings of debt or equity securities (including under our ATM program or other offerings), or through private placements of debt supported by our revolving credit facilities in the case of commercial paper. However, our ability to access these markets or obtain credit from commercial banks outside of our committed revolving credit facilities could become materially constrained if economic conditions worsen or disruptions to or volatility in these markets increase. In addition, our financing activities, actions by credit rating agencies and prevailing interest rates, as well as many other factors, could negatively affect the availability and cost of both short-term and long-term debt and equity financing. In January 2025, S&P revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable and downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A. Also, cash flows \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  82\nTable of Contents\nfrom operations may be impacted by the timing and outcomes of regulatory proceedings, commencement and completion of, and potential cost overruns for, large projects and other material events. If cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow or obtain other financing under acceptable terms, we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures (not related to safety/reliability) and investments in new businesses. We monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating, investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our goal to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings.\nCommon Stock Offering and ATM Program\nIn December 2024, upon full physical settlement of forward sale agreements entered into in connection with our November 2023 common stock offering, we received net proceeds of $1.2 billion from the issuance of 17,142,858 shares of Sempra common stock.\nIn November 2024, we established an ATM program providing for the offer and sale of shares of Sempra common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $3.0 billion through agents acting as our sales agents or as forward sellers or directly to the agents as principals. The shares may be offered and sold in amounts and at times to be determined by us from time to time. At December 31, 2024, approximately $2.7 billion of common stock remained available for sale under the ATM program, which reflects the forward sale agreement that we describe below.\nIn November 2024, we entered into a forward sale agreement under the ATM program for the sale of 2,909,274 shares of Sempra common stock. We did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to this forward sale agreement. At December 31, 2024, a total of 2,909,274 shares of Sempra common stock remain subject to future settlement under this forward sale agreement, which may be settled on one or more dates specified by us occurring no later than June 30, 2026, which is the final settlement date under the agreement. At the initial forward price of $92.1546 per share, we expect that the net proceeds from the full physical settlement of the forward sale agreement would be approximately $268 million (net of sales commissions of approximately $2 million, but before deducting equity issuance costs, and subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the forward sale agreements). Although we expect to settle the forward sale agreement entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreement. The forward sale agreement is also subject to acceleration by the forward purchaser upon the occurrence of certain events.\nWe further discuss these activities, including the use of proceeds, in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAvailable Funds\nOur committed lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper. Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas each has a committed line of credit expiring in 2029 and Sempra Infrastructure has four committed lines of credit expiring on various dates from 2025 through 2030, and an uncommitted line of credit expiring in 2026.\nAVAILABLE FUNDS AT DECEMBER 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nSempra \nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents\n(1)\n$\n1,565 \n$\n— \n$\n12 \nAvailable unused credit\n(2)\n8,620 \n1,083 \n863 \n(1)\n    Amounts at Sempra include $70 held in non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Because our commercial paper programs are supported by these lines, we reflect the amount of commercial paper outstanding and any letters of credit outstanding as a reduction to the available unused credit.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nWe use short-term debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements, fund shareholder dividends, and temporarily finance capital expenditures or acquisitions. SDG&E and SoCalGas use short-term debt primarily to meet working capital needs or to help fund event-specific costs. Commercial paper, a term loan and lines of credit were our primary sources of short-term debt funding in 2024.\nWe discuss our short-term debt activities in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and below in “Sources and Uses of Cash.”\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  83\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows selected statistics for our commercial paper borrowings.\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER STATISTICS\n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAmount outstanding at period end\n$\n754 \n$\n1,313 \n$\n417 \n$\n— \n$\n337 \n$\n947 \nWeighted-average interest rate at period end\n4.67 \n%\n5.48 \n%\n4.76 \n%\n— \n%\n4.56 \n%\n5.44 \n%\nDaily weighted-average outstanding balance\n$\n1,320 \n$\n1,329 \n$\n161 \n$\n48 \n$\n313 \n$\n301 \nDaily weighted-average yield\n4.74 \n%\n5.02 \n%\n2.46 \n%\n1.00 \n%\n4.98 \n%\n4.24 \n%\nMaximum daily amount outstanding\n$\n2,503 \n$\n2,119 \n$\n696 \n$\n408 \n$\n966 \n$\n982 \nLong-Term Debt Activities\nSignificant issuances of and payments on long-term debt in 2024 included the following:\nLONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES AND PAYMENTS\n(Dollars in millions)\nIssuances:\nAmount at issuance\nMaturity\nSempra 6.40% junior subordinated notes\n$\n1,250 \n2054\nSempra 6.875% junior subordinated notes\n600 \n2054\nSempra 6.875% junior subordinated notes\n500 \n2054\nSempra 6.55% junior subordinated notes\n600 \n2055\nSempra 6.625% junior subordinated notes\n400 \n2055\nSDG&E 5.55% first mortgage bonds\n600 \n2054\nSoCalGas 5.05% first mortgage bonds\n600 \n2034\nSoCalGas 5.60% first mortgage bonds\n500 \n2054\nSempra Infrastructure variable rate notes (ECA LNG Phase 1 project)\n231 \n2025\nSempra Infrastructure variable rate notes (PA LNG Phase 1 project)\n832 \n2030\nPayments:\nPayments\nMaturity\nSDG&E variable rate term loan\n$\n400 \n2024\nSoCalGas 3.15% first mortgage bonds\n500 \n2024\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra expects to make interest payments on long-term debt totaling $27.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion is expected to be paid in 2025 and $25.7 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2079. At December 31, 2024, SDG&E expects to make interest payments on long-term debt totaling $6.7 billion, of which $400 million is expected to be paid in 2025 and $6.3 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2054. At December 31, 2024, SoCalGas expects to make interest payments on long-term debt totaling $5.6 billion, of which $300 million is expected to be paid in 2025 and $5.3 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2054. We calculate expected interest payments using the stated interest rate for fixed-rate obligations, including floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. We calculate expected interest payments for variable-rate obligations based on forecasted rates in effect at December 31, 2024.\nWe discuss our long-term debt activities, including the use of proceeds on long-term debt issuances, and maturities in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Ratings\nThe issuer credit ratings of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas remained at investment grade levels in 2024.\nISSUER CREDIT RATINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2024\n \nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nMoody’s\nBaa2 with a stable outlook\nA3 with a stable outlook\nA2 with a stable outlook\nS&P\nBBB+ with a stable outlook\nBBB+ with a stable outlook\nA with a negative outlook\nFitch\nBBB+ with a stable outlook\nBBB+ with a stable outlook\nA with a stable outlook\nOn January 9, 2025, S&P affirmed Sempra’s issuer credit rating and revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable. At the same time, S&P downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A and revised SoCalGas’ outlook to stable from negative. \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  84\nTable of Contents\nDowngrades of or other negative actions with respect to Sempra’s or any of its subsidiaries’ credit ratings or rating outlooks may, depending on the severity, result in the imposition of financial or other burdensome covenants or a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities, the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued, and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities. This could make it more costly for Sempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra’s other subsidiaries to issue debt or equity securities, to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of financing. We provide additional information about our credit ratings at Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nSempra has agreed that, if the credit rating of Oncor’s senior secured debt by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or the equivalent), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT. Oncor’s senior secured debt was rated A2, A+ and A at Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, respectively, at December 31, 2024.\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower’s credit rating. Each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower’s credit rating. For example, assuming a one-notch downgrade: \n▪\nIf Sempra were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 bps. The commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 bps.\n▪\nIf SDG&E were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 12.5 bps. The commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 bps. \n▪\nIf SoCalGas were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 12.5 bps. The commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 2.5 bps. \nSempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments, as we discuss in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nLoans due to/from Affiliates\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra had $352 million in loans due to unconsolidated affiliates.\nPostretirement Benefits\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and PBOP. The trusts’ ability to make ongoing required benefit payments has not been materially adversely affected by changes in asset values, which are dependent on market fluctuations, contributions and withdrawals. However, changes in asset values or other factors in future periods (such as changes to discount rates, assumed rates of return, mortality tables and regulations) may impact funding requirements for pension and PBOP plans. Additionally, contributions to our plans are based on our funding policy, which generally limits payments from exceeding plan assets of 110% of the projected benefit obligation, which are subject to maximum income tax deduction limitations. Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas expect to contribute $283 million, $55 million and $189 million, respectively, to pension and PBOP plans in 2025 and $1.5 billion, $480 million and $768 million, respectively, in the nine years thereafter. At SDG&E and SoCalGas, funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates. We discuss our employee benefit plans and our expected contributions to those plans in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPillar Two\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has introduced a framework known as “Pillar Two” to implement a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction (generally, every country) in which a company does business. Many aspects of the Pillar Two framework became effective beginning in 2024. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. or Mexico will enact legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework, other countries are in the process of introducing and enacting legislation to implement Pillar Two. We do not currently expect the Pillar Two framework to have a material effect on Sempra’s, SDG&E’s or SoCalGas’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nSempra California \nSDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity. Their future performance and liquidity will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process, environmental regulations, economic conditions, actions by legislatures, litigation and the changing energy marketplace, as well as other matters described in this report. SDG&E and SoCalGas expect that the available unused funds from their credit facilities described above, which also supports their commercial paper programs, cash flows from operations, and other incurrences of debt including issuing debt securities and \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  85\nTable of Contents\nobtaining term loans will continue to be adequate to fund their respective current operations and planned capital expenditures. SDG&E and SoCalGas manage their capital structures and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors.\nThe implementation of customer assistance programs and higher 2023 winter season customer billings have resulted in certain SDG&E and SoCalGas customers exhibiting slower payment and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas have regulatory mechanisms to recover credit losses and thus record changes in the allowances for credit losses related to Accounts Receivable – Trade that are probable of recovery in regulatory accounts. Although SDG&E and SoCalGas have regulatory mechanisms to recover credit losses, delay in payments by customers impacts the timing of their cash flows.\nAs we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in regulatory balancing accounts for significant costs at SDG&E and SoCalGas, particularly a change between over and undercollected status, may have a significant impact on cash flows. These changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered or refunded in rates through billings to customers. \nCPUC GRC\n2024 Revenue Requirements and Attrition Year Revenues. \nIn December 2024, the CPUC approved an FD in the 2024 GRC for SDG&E and SoCalGas that authorizes SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ revenue requirements for 2024 and attrition year adjustments for 2025 through 2027, inclusively.\nThe GRC FD adopts a 2024 revenue requirement of $2,699 million for SDG&E’s combined operations ($2,193 million for its electric operations and $506 million for its natural gas operations), which represents an increase of $189 million (7.5%) over its authorized 2023 combined revenue requirement. The GRC FD also specifies an increase in SDG&E’s 2025, 2026, and 2027 combined revenue requirements of $147 million (5.45%), $119 million (4.17%) and $122 million (4.11%), respectively, over the preceding year’s combined revenue requirement, all of which will be updated to implement a previously authorized change in the cost of capital that we describe below that adjusted SDG&E’s rate of return to 7.45%.\nThe GRC FD adopts a 2024 revenue requirement of $3,806 million for SoCalGas, which represents an increase of $324 million (9.3%) over its authorized 2023 revenue requirement. The GRC FD also specifies an increase in SoCalGas’ 2025, 2026, and 2027 revenue requirements of $190 million (5.00%), $116 million (2.91%) and $120 million (2.92%), respectively, over the preceding year’s revenue requirement, all of which will be updated to implement a previously authorized change in the cost of capital that we describe below that adjusted SoCalGas’ rate of return to 7.49%.\nSince the GRC FD is effective retroactive to January 1, 2024, SDG&E and SoCalGas recorded the retroactive impacts in the fourth quarter of 2024. The incremental revenue requirements associated with the period from January 1, 2024 through January 31, 2025 are being recovered in rates over an 18-month period that began on February 1, 2025.\nExisting and Anticipated Requests for Recovery of Specified Safety, Maintenance and Reliability Investments.\n The GRC also provides SDG&E and SoCalGas with numerous mechanisms to seek cost recovery of specified projects and programs. We expect that the requests for cost recovery of these projects and programs, which remain subject to CPUC approval, will result in additional amounts of authorized revenue requirement that are not included in the amounts described above. These projects and programs include (i) the Track 2 and Track 3 requests related to SDG&E’s wildfire mitigation plan costs that we describe below, as well as review of SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan costs incurred from 2015 to 2020, inclusively, which the GRC FD added to the Track 3 request, (ii) the ability to file advice letters to implement the revenue requirements associated with the costs of SDG&E’s Moreno compressor station project and SoCalGas’ Honor Rancho compressor station and customer information system replacement projects, which projects were all approved by the CPUC subject to applicable cost caps, and (iii) the opportunity to file separate applications for cost recovery of mobile home park and gas integrity management programs at both SDG&E and SoCalGas, advanced metering infrastructure replacements at SDG&E, and other projects and programs.\nCCM\nA CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base. The CCM applies in the interim years and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody’s (CCM benchmark rate) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). Alternatively, each of SDG&E and SoCalGas is permitted to file a cost of capital application to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole. In October 2024, the CPUC \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  86\nTable of Contents\nissued an FD to modify the CCM. The FD updates the upward or downward adjustment to authorized ROE, if the CCM is triggered, from 50% to 20% of the change in the benchmark rate during the measurement period. The FD adopted this change effective January 1, 2025, reducing both SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ ROE by 42 bps to 10.23% and 10.08%, respectively, and allowing SDG&E and SoCalGas to update their respective costs of preferred equity and debt for 2025.\nSDG&E\nWildfire Fund\nThe carrying value of SDG&E’s Wildfire Fund asset totaled $276 million at December 31, 2024. We describe the Wildfire Legislation and SDG&E’s commitment to make annual shareholder contributions to the Wildfire Fund through 2028 in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSDG&E is exposed to the risk that the participating California electric IOUs may incur third-party wildfire costs for which they will seek recovery from the Wildfire Fund with respect to wildfires that have occurred since enactment of the Wildfire Legislation in July 2019. In such a situation, SDG&E may recognize a reduction of its Wildfire Fund asset and record accelerated amortization against earnings when available coverage is reduced due to recoverable claims from any of the participating IOUs. PG&E is seeking reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie Fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021. In the case of the recent LA fires, the causes of these fires have not been determined and therefore these fires may not impact the Wildfire Fund. If any California electric IOUs’ assets are determined to be a cause of fires, including fires of the size and scope of the recent LA Fires, payments of claims associated with those events could have a material adverse effect on the Wildfire Fund and on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s financial condition and results of operations up to the carrying value of our Wildfire Fund asset, with additional potential material exposure if SDG&E’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. In addition, the Wildfire Fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in the other California electric IOUs’ service territories, by fires in SDG&E’s service territory or by a combination thereof. In the event that the Wildfire Fund is materially diminished, exhausted or terminated, SDG&E will lose the protection afforded by the Wildfire Fund, and as a consequence, a fire in SDG&E’s service territory could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWildfire Mitigation Cost Recovery Mechanism\n2024 GRC Track 2. \nIn October 2023, SDG&E submitted a separate request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 2 request. This request seeks review and recovery of $1.5 billion of wildfire mitigation plan costs incurred from 2019 through 2022 that were in addition to amounts authorized in the 2019 GRC and not addressed in the 2024 GRC FD. SDG&E expects to receive a proposed decision for its Track 2 request in the first half of 2025.\nRevenue requirements associated with the Track 2 request have been recorded in a regulatory account. In February 2024, the CPUC approved an interim cost recovery mechanism that permits SDG&E to recover in rates $194 million and $96 million of this regulatory account balance in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Such recovery of SDG&E’s wildfire mitigation plan regulatory account balance will be subject to refund, contingent on the reasonableness review decision for its Track 2 request.\n2024 GRC Track 3. \nSDG&E expects to submit in the first half of 2025 an additional request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 3 request, for review and recovery of wildfire mitigation plan costs incurred in 2023.\nFERC Rate Matters\nSDG&E files separately with the FERC for its authorized transmission revenue requirement and ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. \nSDG&E’s authorized TO5 settlement provided for an ROE of 10.60%, consisting of a base ROE of 10.10% plus the California ISO adder. In December 2024, the FERC issued an order, which SDG&E has appealed, finding that SDG&E is not eligible for the California ISO adder and that the TO5 adder refund provision has been triggered, requiring SDG&E to refund customers the California ISO adder retroactively from June 1, 2019. In June 2024, SDG&E exercised its right to terminate the TO5 settlement. Accordingly, in October 2024, SDG&E submitted its TO6 filing to the FERC, requested to be effective January 1, 2025, and subject to refund. SDG&E’s TO6 filing proposes, among other items, an increase to SDG&E’s currently authorized base ROE from 10.10% to 11.75% plus the California ISO adder, for a total ROE of 12.25%. In December 2024, the FERC accepted SDG&E’s TO6 filing but suspended the effective date to June 1, 2025 and disallowed the inclusion of the California ISO adder, which SDG&E has appealed.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  87\nTable of Contents\nSONGS Decommissioning \nSDG&E has significant investments in the SONGS NDT to provide for future payments of nuclear decommissioning. The NDT’s ability to make ongoing required payments has not been materially or adversely affected by changes in asset values, which are dependent on market fluctuations, contributions and withdrawals. However, asset values could be materially and adversely affected by future activity in the equity and fixed income markets, and changes in the estimated decommissioning costs, or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates, could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets. Funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates. We discuss SDG&E’s NDT and its expected SONGS decommissioning payments in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSDG&E has entered into PPAs and tolling agreements that are variable interests in unconsolidated entities. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSoCalGas\nLA Fires\nThe LA Fires burned in SoCalGas’ service territory. As of February 6, 2025, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimated that the Palisades and Eaton fires damaged approximately 2,000 structures and destroyed approximately 16,200 structures.\nThe potential costs to SoCalGas will depend on various factors, including the number of customers impacted and the nature and extent of damage to SoCalGas’ facilities. Due to the limited amount of time that has elapsed since the start of the LA Fires and the limited available information, including continued uncertainty as to the magnitude of their impacts on customers and utility facilities, SoCalGas cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of such potential costs at this time. \nSoCalGas has mechanisms available for potential recovery of costs associated with declared disasters, such as the LA Fires, including through insurance and customer rates. Failure by SoCalGas to timely recover all or a substantial portion of its costs related to the LA Fires or any conclusion that such recovery is no longer probable could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nAliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility \nLitigation.\n From October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced the Leak, which we describe in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” As of February 19, 2025, there are approximately 520 plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits related to the Leak or who declined to participate in a previous settlement related to the Leak and are able to continue to pursue their claims. SoCalGas’ loss contingency accruals do not include any amounts in excess of what has been reasonably estimated to resolve these matters, nor any amounts that may be necessary to resolve threatened litigation, other potential litigation or other costs. We are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued, which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOperations and Reliability. \nNatural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods, including consumer heating needs in the winter and peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest SoCalGas storage facility and an important component of SoCalGas’ delivery system. In December 2024, the CPUC approved an FD in the SB 380 OII finding that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is currently necessary for natural gas and electric reliability and affordable rates and closed the OII. Among other things, and subject to future CPUC biennial reviews and potential additional proceedings, the FD authorizes the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility to continue operating and sets the maximum working natural gas storage level at 68.6 bcf.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of $1.0 billion. If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we would record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, we could incur materially higher than expected operating costs and/or be required to make material additional capital expenditures (any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates), and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  88\nTable of Contents\nLos Angeles County Franchise Agreement\nIn December 2024, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors granted SoCalGas a new, 20-year gas pipeline franchise. The franchise consists of an initial 10-year term beginning on January 9, 2025, followed by a 10-year term that Los Angeles County has the option to terminate. Prior to the granting of the new franchise, SoCalGas continued to serve customers in the unincorporated territory of Los Angeles County in accordance with its prior franchise.\nLabor Relations\nField, technical and most clerical employees at SoCalGas are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America or the International Chemical Workers Union Council. The collective bargaining agreement for these employees covering wages, hours, working conditions, and medical and other benefit plans was due to expire on September 30, 2024, but was extended by mutual agreement through February 7, 2025, while SoCalGas and the unions continued negotiations. Two ratification votes in late 2024 were not successful. SoCalGas is currently operating under the terms of the expired agreement while the parties continue to negotiate revised terms and seek a positive ratification vote from union members. Until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified by employees, there could be labor disruptions, though we do not anticipate that such labor disruptions would have a material impact on service.\nSempra Texas Utilities \nOncor relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the event that Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements, access sufficient capital, or raise capital on favorable terms to finance its ongoing needs, we may elect to make additional capital contributions to Oncor (as our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor), which could be substantial and reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, increase our indebtedness and ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Oncor’s ability to make distributions may be limited by factors such as its credit ratings, regulatory capital requirements, increases in its capital plan, debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT and other restrictions and considerations. In addition, Oncor will not make distributions if a majority of Oncor’s independent directors or any minority member director determines it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements.\nRates and Cost Recovery \nThe PUCT issued a final order in Oncor’s most recent comprehensive base rate proceeding in April 2023, and rates implementing that order went into effect on May 1, 2023. In June 2023, the PUCT issued an order on rehearing in response to the motions for rehearing filed by Oncor and certain intervenor parties in the proceeding. The order on rehearing made certain technical and typographical corrections to the final order but otherwise affirmed the material provisions of the final order and did not require modification of the rates that went into effect on May 1, 2023. In September 2023, Oncor filed an appeal in Travis County District Court seeking judicial review of certain rate base disallowances and related expense effects of those disallowances in the PUCT’s order on rehearing. In February 2024, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In March 2024, Oncor appealed the court’s dismissal, which is currently with the Fifteenth Court of Appeals in Texas.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement \nOur investment in Oncor Holdings is a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSempra Infrastructure\nSempra Infrastructure expects to fund capital expenditures, investments and operations in part with available funds, including existing credit facilities, and cash flows from operations from the Sempra Infrastructure businesses. We expect Sempra Infrastructure will require additional funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects, which may be financed through a combination of funding from the parent and NCI owners, bank financing, issuances of debt, project financing, partnering in JVs and asset sales.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, Sempra Infrastructure distributed $297 million, $730 million and $237 million, respectively, to its NCI owners, and NCI owners contributed $1,235 million, $1,770 million and $31 million, respectively, to Sempra Infrastructure.\nSempra Infrastructure is in various stages of development or construction of natural gas liquefaction projects, pipeline and terminal projects, and renewable power generation and sequestration projects, which we describe below. The successful development and/or construction of these projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  89\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to projects in development, these risks and uncertainties include, as applicable depending on the project, any failure to:\n▪\nsecure binding customer commitments\n▪\nidentify suitable project and equity partners\n▪\nobtain sufficient financing\n▪\nreach agreement with project partners or other applicable parties to proceed\n▪\nobtain, modify, and/or maintain permits and regulatory approvals, including LNG export applications to non-FTA countries\n▪\nnegotiate, complete and maintain suitable commercial agreements, which may include EPC, tolling, equity acquisition, governance, LNG sales, gas supply and transportation contracts\n▪\nreach a positive final investment decision\nWith respect to projects under construction, these risks and uncertainties include, in addition to the risks described above as applicable to each project, construction delays and cost overruns.\nAn unfavorable outcome with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on (i) the development and construction of the applicable project, including a potential impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the project to date, which could be material, and (ii) for any project that has reached a positive final investment decision, Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. For a further discussion of these risks, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nThe descriptions below discuss several HOAs, MOUs and other non-binding development agreements with respect to Sempra Infrastructure’s various development projects. These arrangements do not commit any party to enter into definitive agreements or otherwise participate in the applicable project, and the ultimate participation by the parties remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors.\nLNG\nCameron LNG Phase 2 Project.\n Cameron LNG JV is developing a proposed expansion project that would add one electric drive liquefaction train with an expected maximum production capacity of approximately 6.75 Mtpa and would increase the production capacity of the existing three trains at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility by up to approximately 1 Mtpa through debottlenecking activities. The Cameron LNG JV site can accommodate additional trains beyond the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project.\nCameron LNG JV has received major permits, which have been amended to allow the use of electric drives for a one-train electric drive expansion along with other design enhancements, and FTA and non-FTA approvals associated with the potential expansion. The non-FTA approval for the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project includes, among other things, a May 2026 deadline to commence commercial exports, for which we expect to request an extension.\nSempra Infrastructure and the other Cameron LNG JV members, namely affiliates of TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Japan LNG Investment, LLC, a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, have entered into a non-binding HOA for the potential development of the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. The non-binding HOA provides a commercial framework for the proposed project, including the contemplated allocation to SI Partners of 50.2% of the fourth train production capacity and 25% of the debottlenecking capacity from the project under tolling agreements. The non-binding HOA contemplates the remaining capacity to be allocated equally to the existing Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility customers. \nCameron LNG JV concluded additional value engineering work on the proposed project in December 2024, which improved the overall value of the project and enabled evaluation of another potential EPC contractor. In collaboration with our partners, we continue to evaluate these materials as well as the timeframe to make a final investment decision, which remains subject to satisfactory conclusion on the EPC process as well as negotiation and finalization of definitive offtake agreements and completion of all related financing and permitting activities.\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC, a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, and Cameron LNG JV have an electricity service agreement (and related ancillary agreements) for the supply to Cameron LNG JV of up to 950 MW of power from new renewable sources in Louisiana.\nExpansion of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the JV project financing agreements, including among others, scope restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the existing project lenders. Under the Cameron LNG JV equity agreements, the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the members, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each member.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  90\nTable of Contents\nECA LNG Phase 1 Project.\n ECA LNG Phase 1 is constructing a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of Sempra Infrastructure’s existing ECA Regas Facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 2.5 Mtpa. We do not expect the construction or operation of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility. \nWe received authorizations from the DOE to export U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and to re-export LNG to non-FTA countries from the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. ECA LNG Phase 1 has definitive 20-year SPAs with an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE for approximately 1.7 Mtpa of LNG and with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. for approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG. The customers have a termination right if the ECA LNG Phase 1 project does not commence commercial operations under the SPAs by February 24, 2026, subject to certain additional conditions, for which we expect to request an extension if necessary.\nWe have an EPC contract with TP Oil & Gas Mexico, S. De R.L. De C.V., an affiliate of Technip Energies N.V., to construct the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. We estimate the total price of the EPC contract to be approximately $1.6 billion, with capital expenditures approximating $2.5 billion including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual cost of the EPC contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. We expect the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in the spring of 2026.\nECA LNG Phase 1 has a five-year loan agreement with a syndicate of seven external lenders that matures in December 2025, which we expect to extend, for an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion was outstanding at December 31, 2024. Proceeds from the loan are being used to finance the cost of construction of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project.\nWith respect to the ECA LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects, recent and proposed changes to the Mexican Constitution and certain laws in Mexico and an unfavorable resolution of land disputes and permit challenges, in each case that we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, could have a material adverse effect on the development and construction of these projects.\nECA LNG Phase 2 Project.\n Sempra Infrastructure is developing a second, large-scale natural gas liquefaction project at the site of its existing ECA Regas Facility. We expect the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project to be comprised of two trains and one LNG storage tank and produce approximately 12 Mtpa of export capacity. We expect that construction of the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the ECA Regas Facility, which currently has firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell and SEFE that expire in May 2028 and December 2025, respectively.\nWe received authorizations from the DOE to export U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and to re-export LNG to non-FTA countries from the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project.\nWe have non-binding MOUs and/or HOAs with Mitsui & Co., Ltd., an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE, and ConocoPhillips that provide a framework for their potential offtake of LNG from the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project and potential acquisition of an equity interest in ECA LNG Phase 2. \nPA LNG Phase 1 Project.\n Sempra Infrastructure is constructing a natural gas liquefaction project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas, located along the Sabine-Neches waterway. The PA LNG Phase 1 project will consist of two liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks, a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of approximately 10.5 Mtpa.\nSempra Infrastructure has received authorizations from the DOE that permit the LNG to be produced from the PA LNG Phase 1 project to be exported to all current and future FTA and non-FTA countries. In April 2019, the FERC approved the siting, construction and operation of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. Port Arthur LNG has received authorization from the FERC to increase its work force and implement a 24-hours-per-day construction schedule to further enhance construction efficiency while reducing temporal impacts to the community and environment in the vicinity of the project. The authorization provides the EPC contractor with more optionality to meet or exceed the project’s construction schedule.\nThe PA LNG Phase 1 project holds two Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration permits issued by the TCEQ, which we refer to as the “2016 Permit” and the “2022 Permit.” The 2022 Permit also governs emissions for the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. In November 2023, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision to vacate and remand the 2022 Permit to the TCEQ for additional explanation of the agency’s permit decision. In February 2024, the court withdrew its opinion and referred the case to the Supreme Court of Texas to resolve the question of the appropriate standard to be applied by the TCEQ. In February 2025, the Supreme Court of Texas adopted Port Arthur LNG’s interpretation of the standard. Port Arthur LNG continues to litigate this matter before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will apply the standard adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas. The 2022 Permit is effective during the pending litigation. The 2016 Permit was not the subject of, and is unaffected by, the pending litigation of the 2022 Permit. Construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project is proceeding \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  91\nTable of Contents\nuninterrupted under existing permits, and we do not currently anticipate the pending litigation to materially impact the PA LNG Phase 1 project cost, schedule or expected commercial operations at this stage.\nSempra Infrastructure has definitive SPAs for LNG offtake from the PA LNG Phase 1 project with:\n▪\nan affiliate of ConocoPhillips for a 20-year term for 5 Mtpa of LNG, as well as a natural gas supply management agreement whereby an affiliate of ConocoPhillips will manage the feed gas supply requirements for the PA LNG Phase 1 project.\n▪\nRWE Supply & Trading GmbH, a subsidiary of RWE AG, for a 15-year term for 2.25 Mtpa of LNG.\n▪\nINEOS for a 20-year term for approximately 1.4 Mtpa of LNG.\n▪\nORLEN for a 20-year term for approximately 1 Mtpa of LNG.\n▪\nENGIE S.A. for a 15-year term for approximately 0.875 Mtpa of LNG.\nWe have an EPC contract with Bechtel to construct the PA LNG Phase 1 project, which has an estimated price of approximately $10.7 billion. We estimate the capital expenditures for the PA LNG Phase 1 project will be approximately $13 billion including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual cost of the EPC contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. We expect the first and second trains of the PA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nAs we discuss in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, SI Partners and ConocoPhillips have provided guarantees relating to their respective affiliate’s commitment to make its pro rata equity share of capital contributions to fund 110% of the development budget of the PA LNG Phase 1 project, in an aggregate amount of up to $9.0 billion. SI Partners’ guarantee covers 70% of this amount plus enforcement costs of its guarantee. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate amount of $2.7 billion has been paid by SI Partners’ subsidiary in satisfaction of its commitment to fund its portion of the development budget of the PA LNG Phase 1 project.\nPort Arthur LNG has a seven-year term loan facility for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.8 billion and an initial working capital facility for up to $200 million, each of which matures in March 2030. At December 31, 2024, $1.1 billion of borrowings were outstanding under the term loan facility agreement. Proceeds from the loan are being used to finance the cost of construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. \nIn November 2024, Port Arthur LNG signed an agreement to issue senior secured notes in January 2025 for $750 million and April 2025 for $250 million. The net proceeds from the January 2025 issuance and the expected net proceeds from the April 2025 issuance were or will be used to pay transaction fees and repay borrowings under the existing Port Arthur LNG term loan facility. The senior secured notes mature in December 2042 and the January 2025 and April 2025 issuances bear interest at the rate of 6.27% and 6.32% per annum, respectively.\nPA LNG Phase 2 Project.\n Sempra Infrastructure is developing a second phase of the Port Arthur natural gas liquefaction project that we expect will be a similar size to the PA LNG Phase 1 project. We are progressing the development of the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project, while continuing to evaluate overall opportunities to develop the entirety of the Port Arthur site.\nIn September 2023, the FERC approved the siting, construction and operation of the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project, including the potential addition of up to two liquefaction trains. In February 2020, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the DOE to permit LNG produced from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project to be exported to all current and future non-FTA countries. We received FTA authorization from the DOE in July 2020.\nAs we discuss above, a U.S. federal court previously issued and subsequently withdrew a decision that would have vacated and remanded the 2022 Permit authorizing emissions from the PA LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects to the TCEQ for additional explanation of the agency’s permit decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit referred the case to the Supreme Court of Texas to resolve the question of the appropriate standard to be applied by the TCEQ. In February 2025, the Supreme Court of Texas adopted Port Arthur LNG’s interpretation of the standard. Port Arthur LNG continues to litigate this matter before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will apply the standard adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas. The 2022 Permit is effective during the pending litigation.\nSempra Infrastructure has entered into a non-binding HOA for a 20-year SPA with Aramco for 5 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. The HOA further contemplates Aramco’s 25% participation in the project-level equity of the PA LNG Phase 2 project.\nIn July 2024, Sempra Infrastructure entered into an $8.2 billion EPC contract with Bechtel for the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. The EPC contract contemplates the construction of two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa, an additional LNG storage tank and marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services. We have no obligation to move forward on the EPC contract, and we may release Bechtel to perform \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  92\nTable of Contents\nportions of the work pursuant to limited notices to proceed. The price is subject to increase if certain limited notices to proceed and the full notice to proceed are not issued, each by specified dates. We expect to work with Bechtel with respect to such changes based on the ultimate timeline for the project and plan to fully release Bechtel to perform all the work to construct the PA LNG Phase 2 project only after we reach a final investment decision, which we are targeting in 2025, and after certain other conditions are met, including obtaining permits, executing definitive agreements for LNG offtake and equity investments, and securing project financing.\nVista Pacifico LNG Liquefaction Project. \nSempra Infrastructure is developing the Vista Pacifico LNG project, a mid-scale natural gas liquefaction export facility proposed to be located in the vicinity of the Port of Topolobampo in Sinaloa, Mexico. In June 2024, we extended the non-binding development agreement with the CFE through December 2025. We continue to progress with the CFE on the negotiation of definitive agreements, including a natural gas supply agreement. The proposed LNG export terminal would be supplied with U.S. natural gas and would use excess capacity on existing pipelines in Mexico with the intent of helping to meet growing demand for natural gas and LNG in the Mexican and Pacific markets.\nSempra Infrastructure received authorization from the DOE to permit the export of U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and for LNG produced from the proposed Vista Pacifico LNG facility to be re-exported to all current and future FTA countries and non-FTA countries.\nIn March 2022, TotalEnergies SE and Sempra Infrastructure entered into a non-binding MOU that contemplates TotalEnergies SE potentially contracting approximately one-third of the long-term export production of the proposed Vista Pacifico LNG project and potentially participating as a minority partner in the project.\nAsset and Supply Optimization. \nAs we discuss in “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” Sempra Infrastructure enters into hedging transactions to help mitigate commodity price risk and optimize the value of its LNG, natural gas pipelines and storage, and power-generating assets. Some of these derivatives that we use as economic hedges do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not elected, and as a result, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. Consequently, significant changes in commodity prices have in the past and could in the future result in earnings volatility, which may be material, as the economic offset of these derivatives may not be recorded at fair value.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. \nOur investment in Cameron LNG JV is a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIn June 2021, Sempra provided a promissory note, which constitutes a guarantee, for the benefit of Cameron LNG JV with a maximum exposure to loss of $165 million. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of Cameron LNG JV’s debt, scheduled to occur in 2039, or replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA. We discuss this guarantee in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn July 2020, Sempra entered into a Support Agreement, which contains a guarantee and represents a variable interest, for the benefit of CFIN with a maximum exposure to loss of $979 million. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of the guaranteed debt by 2039, including repayment following an event in which the guaranteed debt is put to Sempra. We discuss this guarantee in Notes 1, 5 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnergy Networks \nSonora Pipeline.\n Sempra Infrastructure’s Sonora natural gas pipeline consists of two pipeline segments, the Sasabe-Puerto Libertad-Guaymas segment and the Guaymas-El Oro segment. Each segment has its own service agreement with the CFE. Following the start of commercial operations of the Guaymas-El Oro segment, Sempra Infrastructure reported damage to the pipeline in the Yaqui territory that has made that section inoperable since August 2017 because it was not able to be repaired due to legal challenges, which were resolved in March 2023, by some members of the Yaqui tribe.\nIn September 2019, Sempra Infrastructure and the CFE reached an agreement to modify the tariff structure and extend the term of the contract by 10 years. Under the revised agreement, the CFE will resume making payments only when the damaged section of the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline is back in service.\nSempra Infrastructure and the CFE have agreed to an amendment to their transportation services agreement and to re-route the portion of the pipeline that is in the Yaqui territory, whereby the CFE would pay for the re-routing with a new tariff. This amendment will terminate if certain conditions are not met, and Sempra Infrastructure retains the right to terminate the transportation services agreement and seek to recover its reasonable and documented costs and lost profit. Sempra Infrastructure continues to acquire and pursue the necessary rights-of-way and permits for the portion of the pipeline that needs to be re-routed.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  93\nTable of Contents\nThe Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline currently constitutes a Sole Risk Project under the terms of the SI Partners limited partnership agreement, which means that Sempra Infrastructure holds a 100% interest in the project. Sole Risk Projects are separated from other SI Partners projects and are conducted at Sempra’s sole cost, expense and liability and Sempra Infrastructure receives, through the acquisition of Sole Risk Interests, any economic and other benefits from such projects. At December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure had $401 million in PP&E, net, related to the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline, which could be subject to impairment if Sempra Infrastructure is unable to re-route a portion of the pipeline and resume operations or if Sempra Infrastructure terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery, which in each case could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nRefined Products Terminals.\n Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates terminals for the receipt, storage, and delivery of refined products; one such terminal located in Topolobampo commenced commercial operations in June 2024. Sempra Infrastructure is also developing terminals for the receipt, storage, and delivery of refined products in the vicinity of Manzanillo and Ensenada.\nPort Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. \nSempra Infrastructure is constructing the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector, a 72-mile pipeline connecting the PA LNG Phase 1 project to Gillis, Louisiana. In April 2019, the FERC approved the siting, construction and operation of the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector, which will be used to supply feed gas to the PA LNG Phase 1 project. Sempra Infrastructure received FERC approval to implement construction process enhancements and minor modifications to several discrete sections of the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. These modifications are intended to decrease environmental impacts, accommodate landowner routing requests and enhance construction procedures. We expect the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector to be ready for service ahead of the PA LNG Phase 1 project’s gas requirements. We estimate the capital expenditures for the project will be approximately $1 billion, including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates.\nLouisiana Storage. \nSempra Infrastructure is constructing Louisiana Storage, a 12.5-Bcf salt dome natural gas storage facility to support the PA LNG Phase 1 project. The construction includes an 11-mile pipeline that will connect to the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. In September 2022, the FERC approved the development of the project. We expect Louisiana Storage to be ready for service in time to support the needs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. We estimate the capital expenditures for the project will be approximately $300 million, including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates.\nLow Carbon Solutions\nCimarrón Wind.\n Sempra Infrastructure has made a positive final investment decision on and begun constructing the Cimarrón Wind project, an approximately 320 MW wind generation facility in Baja California, Mexico. Sempra Infrastructure has a 20-year PPA with Silicon Valley Power for the long-term supply of renewable energy to the City of Santa Clara, California. Cimarrón Wind will utilize Sempra Infrastructure’s existing cross-border high voltage transmission line to interconnect and deliver clean energy to the East County substation in San Diego County. We estimate the capital expenditures for the project will be approximately $550 million, including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. We expect the Cimarrón Wind project to begin generating energy in late 2025 and commence commercial operations in the first half of 2026. \nHackberry Carbon Sequestration Project.\n Sempra Infrastructure is developing the potential Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project near Hackberry, Louisiana, together with TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation. This proposed project is designed to permanently sequester carbon dioxide from the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility, the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project and potentially other sources. In 2021, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the EPA for a Class VI carbon injection well permit, which is under review by the State of Louisiana.\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nSee Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” for discussions of the following legal and regulatory matters affecting our operations in Mexico and risks associated with Mexican laws, policies and government influence: \nEnergía Costa Azul\n▪\nLand Disputes\n▪\nEnvironmental and Social Impact Permits\nOne or more unfavorable final decisions on these land disputes or environmental and social impact permit challenges could materially adversely affect our existing natural gas regasification operations and proposed natural gas liquefaction projects at the \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  94\nTable of Contents\nsite of the ECA Regas Facility and have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nRegulatory and Other Actions by the Mexican Government\n▪\nAmendments to Mexico’s Hydrocarbons Law\n▪\nAmendments to Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law\nSempra Infrastructure and other parties affected by these amendments to Mexican law have challenged them by filing amparo and other claims, some of which remain pending. In particular, Sempra Infrastructure filed one lawsuit concerning the provision of Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law permitting revocation of self-supply permits deemed improperly obtained that was dismissed by the court. Consequently, the CRE may be required to seek to revoke such self-supply permits, under a legal standard that is ambiguous and not well defined under the law. An unfavorable decision on one or more of these amparo or other challenges, the impact of the amendments that have become effective (due to unsuccessful amparo challenges or otherwise), or the possibility of future reforms to the energy industry through additional amendments to Mexican laws, regulations or rules (including through amendments to the Mexican Constitution) may impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, may result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and its customers, may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, may result in decreased revenues and cash flows, and may negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which may have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSubsequent to the federal elections in Mexico in 2024 and, as noted above, the Mexican government has begun to introduce significant changes to the Mexican Constitution, which will require changes in laws, policies, and regulations in order to be implemented. These changes have included Mexican Constitutional reforms affecting the judiciary and the for-profit status of certain state-owned enterprises. The changes to the judiciary include a requirement that all judges be elected rather than appointed. The energy reforms have the potential to increase government control and participation in the energy sector and to create novel challenges for infrastructure development and operations. Additionally, a set of six energy-related laws, including modifications to the Hydrocarbons Law and Electricity Industry Law, were submitted to Mexico’s Congress in January 2025. The legislative session runs from February 1 to April 30, and the government is targeting approval by the end of March 2025. These reforms and any further Mexican Constitutional, legal or regulatory changes could affect the Mexican economy, energy sector and our businesses, the extent of which we currently are unable to predict.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  95\nTable of Contents\nSOURCES AND USES OF CASH\nWe discuss herein our sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Risk Factors.” In 2025, we expect to make capital expenditures for PP&E and investments of approximately $12.5 billion, as summarized by segment in the following table.\nFUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PP&E AND INVESTMENTS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYear ending December 31, 2025\nSempra:\nSempra California\n(1)\n$\n4,740 \nSempra Texas Utilities\n1,935 \nSempra Infrastructure\n5,777 \nSegment totals\n12,452 \nParent and other\n2 \nTotal Sempra\n$\n12,454 \n(1)\n    \nIncludes expected future capital expenditures of $2,632 and $2,108 at SDG&E and SoCalGas, respectively.\nWe expect the majority of our capital expenditures for PP&E and investments in 2025 will relate to investments in transmission and distribution safety and reliability at our regulated public utilities and construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project, ECA LNG Phase 1 project and natural gas pipelines at Sempra Infrastructure.\nFrom 2025 through 2029, and subject to the factors described below, which could cause these estimates to vary substantially, Sempra expects to make aggregate capital expenditures for PP&E and investments of approximately $41.4 billion, as follows: $22.4 billion at Sempra California (which includes $12.7 billion at SDG&E and $9.7 billion at SoCalGas), $8.1 billion at Sempra Texas Utilities, and $10.9 billion at Sempra Infrastructure. Capital expenditure amounts for PP&E include capitalized interest and AFUDC related to debt.\nWhen (i) including Sempra’s proportionate ownership interest in expected capital expenditures for PP&E at unconsolidated equity method investees while excluding Sempra’s expected capital contributions to those unconsolidated equity method investees and (ii) excluding NCI’s proportionate ownership interest in expected capital expenditures for PP&E at Sempra and at unconsolidated equity method investees, we expect capital expenditures for PP&E from 2025 through 2029 to total $55.5 billion. \nOncor currently anticipates that its five-year capital expenditures plan could grow by approximately $12 billion over the 2025 through 2029 period due to potential additions to its system resiliency plan expected to occur in 2028 and 2029, potential projects that are pending regulatory action and customer projects that are in Oncor’s transmission interconnection queue but do not yet have signed agreements. Significant changes in Oncor’s capital expenditures plan could result in significant changes to our capital expenditures plan. To the extent Oncor’s five-year capital expenditures plan grows, Sempra expects that its five-year plan for capital expenditures for PP&E and investments, as well as its plan when including its proportionate ownership interest in Oncor’s capital expenditures and excluding Sempra’s expected capital contributions to Oncor, would each grow by Sempra’s 80.25% interest in Oncor’s incremental capital expenditures. \nPeriodically, we review our construction, investment and financing programs and revise them in response to changes in regulation, economic conditions, competition, customer growth, inflation, customer rates, the cost and availability of capital, and safety and environmental requirements. \nOur level of capital expenditures for PP&E and investments in the next few years may vary substantially and will depend on, among other things, the cost and availability of financing, regulatory approvals, changes in tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return, among various other factors described in this MD&A and in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We aim to finance our capital expenditures for PP&E and investments in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.\nRate Base\nFor SDG&E and SoCalGas, rate base is the value of assets on which SDG&E and SoCalGas are permitted to earn a specified rate of return in accordance with rules set by regulatory agencies, including the CPUC and the FERC (for SDG&E), which is calculated using a 13-month average in accordance with CPUC methodology as adopted in rate-setting proceedings. The following table summarizes the weighted-average rate base for SDG&E and SoCalGas for the last three years. \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  98\nTable of Contents\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE RATE BASE\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSDG&E\n$\n16,842 \n$\n15,220 \n$\n13,780 \nSoCalGas\n12,446 \n11,671 \n10,494 \nThe increase in weighted-average rate base reflects the significant capital investments that SDG&E and SoCalGas have made in transmission and distribution safety and reliability. We expect the weighted-average rate base to continue to increase in 2025 based on our expected capital investments. \nFor Oncor, rate base represents the total invested capital, as adjusted in accordance with PUCT rules, at the end of the previous calendar year as reported in the Earnings Monitoring Report filed with the PUCT on an annual basis. Oncor’s regulatory rate base as reported in these filings as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $23.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively. As calculated on a similar basis, its estimated regulatory rate base at December 31, 2024 was $26.6 billion. The increase in rate base reflects the significant capital investments that Oncor has made in its transmission and distribution system, and we expect rate base to continue to increase in 2025 based on Oncor’s expected capital investments.\nCapital Stock Transactions\nSempra \nCash provided by issuances of common stock was:\n▪\n$1,219 million in 2024 \n▪\n$145 million in 2023 \n▪\n$4 million in 2022 \nCash used for repurchases of common stock was:\n▪\n$43 million in 2024 \n▪\n$32 million in 2023 \n▪\n$478 million in 2022 \nWe discuss the issuances and repurchases of common stock in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nSempra \nSempra paid cash dividends of:\n▪\n$1,499 million for common stock and $44 million for preferred stock in 2024 \n▪\n$1,483 million for common stock and $44 million for preferred stock in 2023 \n▪\n$1,430 million for common stock and $44 million for preferred stock in 2022 \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  99\nTable of Contents\nDIVIDENDS PER SHARE ON SEMPRA COMMON STOCK\n(As approved by our board of directors)\nOn February 24, 2025, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.645 per share on our common stock and a dividend of $24.375 per share on our series C preferred stock, both payable on April 15, 2025. \nAll declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors. While we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return, the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other relevant factors at that time. As a result, Sempra’s dividends on common stock and preferred stock declared on a historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations. \nSDG&E\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, SDG&E paid common stock dividends to Enova Corporation and Enova Corporation paid corresponding dividends to Sempra of $225 million, $100 million and $100 million, respectively. SDG&E’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations. Rather, SDG&E’s common stock dividends in the next few years may be impacted as available cash is used to maintain its authorized capital structure while supporting its capital investment program.\nEnova Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra, owns all of SDG&E’s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SDG&E to Enova Corporation and dividends paid by Enova Corporation to Sempra are eliminated in Sempra’s consolidated financial statements.\nSoCalGas\nIn 2024 and 2023, SoCalGas paid common stock dividends to Pacific Enterprises and Pacific Enterprises paid corresponding dividends to Sempra of $200 million and $100 million, respectively. SoCalGas did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2022. SoCalGas’ dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations. Rather, SoCalGas’ common stock dividends in the next few years may be impacted as available cash is used to maintain its authorized capital structure while supporting its capital investment program.\nPacific Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra, owns all of SoCalGas’ outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SoCalGas to Pacific Enterprises and dividends paid by Pacific Enterprises to Sempra are eliminated in Sempra’s consolidated financial statements.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  100\nTable of Contents\nDividend Restrictions\nThe board of directors for each of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas has the discretion to determine whether to declare and, if declared, the amount of any dividends by each such entity. The CPUC’s regulation of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to Sempra. At December 31, 2024, based on these regulations, Sempra could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately $672 million from SDG&E and $457 million from SoCalGas. In addition, the terms of Sempra’s series C preferred stock limit Sempra’s ability to declare dividends on its common stock under certain circumstances.\nWe provide additional information about dividend restrictions in “Restricted Net Assets” in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapitalization\nOur total capitalization, which is the sum of total debt and equity, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which is calculated as total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, was as follows:\nTOTAL CAPITALIZATION AND DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIO\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal capitalization\nDebt-to-capitalization ratio\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nSempra\n$\n73,636 \n$\n64,730 \n49 \n%\n48 \n%\nSDG&E\n21,041 \n19,796 \n50 \n50 \nSoCalGas\n16,602 \n15,167 \n51 \n51 \nIn 2024 compared to 2023, Sempra’s total capitalization increased by $8.9 billion (14%) due to:\n▪\nincrease in long-term debt\n▪\nincrease in equity primarily from comprehensive income exceeding dividends, issuances of common stock and contributions from NCI\nOffset by:\n▪\ndecrease in short-term debt\n▪\ndistributions to NCI\nIn 2024 compared to 2023, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ total capitalization increased by $1.2 billion (6%) and $1.4 billion (9%), respectively, due to increases in equity from comprehensive income exceeding dividends and increases in debt.\n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement views the accounting estimates that we describe below as critical because their application is the most relevant, judgmental and/or material to our financial position and results of operations, and/or because they require the use of material judgments and estimates. We discuss critical accounting estimates that are material to our financial statements with the Audit Committee of Sempra’s board of directors.\nREGULATORY ACCOUNTING\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\nAs regulated entities, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates, as set and monitored by regulators, are designed to recover the cost of providing service and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. SDG&E and SoCalGas assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new and/or unusual events occur, such as:\n▪\nchanges in the regulatory and political environment or the utility’s competitive position\n▪\nissuance of a regulatory commission order\n▪\npassage of new legislation\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  101\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change, the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate.\nSignificant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund, as well as the existence and amount of regulatory liabilities. Adverse regulatory or legislative actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the associated regulatory assets would need to be written off against current period earnings, or adverse regulatory or legislative actions could give rise to material new or higher regulatory liabilities. We discuss details of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances in Notes 1, 4, 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nINCOME TAXES\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\nOur income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates. Amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. When we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues, we consider:\n▪ past resolutions of the same issue or similar issues\n▪ the status of any income tax examination in progress\n▪ positions taken by taxing authorities with other taxpayers with similar issues\nThe likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income, based on our strategic planning. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we would record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of:\n▪ future impacts of various items, including changes in tax laws, regulations, interpretations and rulings\n▪ our financial condition in future periods\n▪ the resolution of various income tax issues between us and taxing and regulatory authorities\nUnrecognized income tax benefits involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained. The final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe discuss these matters and additional information related to accounting for income taxes, including uncertainty in income taxes, in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPENSION AND PBOP PLANS\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\nTo measure our pension and PBOP obligations, costs and liabilities, we rely on several assumptions. We consider current market conditions, including interest rates, in making these assumptions. We review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate. \nThe critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors: \n▪\ndiscount rates\n▪\nexpected return on plan assets\n▪\nhealth care cost trend rates\n▪\ninterest crediting rate on cash balance accounts\n▪\nmortality rate\n▪\nrate of compensation increases\n▪\ntermination and retirement rates\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  102\nTable of Contents\n▪\nutilization of postretirement welfare benefits\n▪\npayout elections (lump sum or annuity)\n▪\nlump sum interest rates\nThe actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to: \n▪\nreturn on plan assets\n▪\nchanging market and economic conditions\n▪\nhigher or lower withdrawal rates\n▪\nlonger or shorter participant life spans\n▪\nmore or fewer lump sum versus annuity payout elections made by plan participants\n▪\nhigher or lower retirement rates\nChanges in the estimated costs or timing of pension and PBOP, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates (primarily the discount rate and expected return on plan assets), as well as changes in the circumstances associated with rate recovery, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. The following tables summarize the impact to our projected benefit obligation for pension and accumulated benefit obligation for PBOP at December 31, 2024, and 2024 net periodic benefit costs, in each case if the discount rate or expected return on plan assets were changed by 1%.\nIMPACT DUE TO INCREASE/DECREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE\n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nIncrease \nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nPension:\n(Decrease) increase to projected benefit obligation,\nnet\n$\n(292)\n$\n(379)\n$\n(38)\n$\n59 \n$\n(241)\n$\n304 \n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n(1)\n16 \n2 \n(1)\n(4)\n17 \nPBOP:\n(Decrease) increase to accumulated benefit\nobligation, net\n(67)\n94 \n(9)\n22 \n(56)\n69 \n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n(6)\n7 \n(1)\n1 \n(4)\n5 \nIMPACT DUE TO INCREASE/DECREASE IN RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS \n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nPension:\n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n$\n(39)\n$\n39 \n$\n(9)\n$\n9 \n$\n(28)\n$\n28 \nPBOP:\n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n(12)\n12 \n(1)\n1 \n(10)\n10 \nFor SDG&E and SoCalGas plans, the effects of the assumptions on earnings are expected to be recovered in rates and therefore are offset in regulatory accounts. We provide details of our pension and PBOP plans in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSONGS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nSempra, SDG&E \nSDG&E’s legal AROs related to the decommissioning of SONGS are estimated based on a site-specific study performed no less than every three years. The estimate of the obligations includes: \n▪ estimated decommissioning costs, including labor, equipment, material and other disposal costs \n▪ inflation adjustment applied to estimated cash flows \n▪ discount rate based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate \n▪ actual decommissioning costs, progress to date and expected duration of decommissioning activities \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  103\nTable of Contents\nSDG&E’s nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and, therefore, rate-making accounting treatment is applied to SDG&E’s nuclear decommissioning activities. SDG&E recognizes a regulatory asset, or liability, to the extent that its SONGS ARO exceeds, or is less than, the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in SDG&E’s NDT.\nSDG&E’s ARO related to the decommissioning of SONGS was $471 million as of December 31, 2024, based on the decommissioning cost study prepared in 2024. Changes in the estimated costs, execution strategy or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission this facility, which could have a material effect on the recorded liability.\nThe following table illustrates the increase to SDG&E’s and Sempra’s ARO liability if the cost escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant:\nINCREASE TO ARO AND REGULATORY ASSET\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nUniform increase in escalation percentage of 1%\n$\n62\nThe increase in the ARO liability driven by an increase in the cost escalation rate would result in a decrease in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of ARO liabilities. We provide additional detail in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIMPAIRMENT TESTING OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nSempra \nWhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. If so, we estimate the fair value of the asset to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value. For such an estimate, we may consider data from multiple valuation methods, including data from market participants. We exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful life of a long-lived asset and to determine our intent to use the asset. Our intent to use or dispose of a long-lived asset is subject to re-evaluation and can change over time. If such an impairment test is required, the fair value of a long-lived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. Critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include:\n▪\nconsideration of market transactions\n▪\nfuture cash flows\n▪\nthe appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, including the impacts of country risk and entity risk\nWe discuss impairment of long-lived assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL\nSempra \nWhen determining if goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. As a result, recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required. When we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value. Our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant. We consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments, if available, as well as an income-based approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit. Critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include:\n▪\nconsideration of market transactions\n▪\nfuture cash flows\n▪\nprojected revenue and expense growth rates\n▪\nthe appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, including the impacts of country risk, customer creditworthiness and entity risk\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  104\nTable of Contents\nHistorically, we determined based on a quantitative goodwill impairment test that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in Mexico, to which goodwill was allocated, were substantially above their respective carrying values as of October 1, our annual goodwill impairment testing date. Upon performing a qualitative analysis as of October 1, 2024, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of such reporting units was less than their respective carrying values. Our goodwill impairment test is determined based on assumptions existing as of that point in time. Changes in the business (such as loss of future cash flows from customer disputes, renegotiation of customer contracts or the macroeconomic environment, including rising interest rates) may result in us having to perform an interim goodwill impairment test, which could result in an impairment of our goodwill.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nWe discuss the recent accounting pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements and/or disclosures in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",
