Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRecent Trends\nIn recent months, the United States government announced additional tariffs and trade restrictions on goods imported into the U.S. from various nations. The U.S. government is negotiating with several of these nations regarding the tariffs, however, the outcome of these negotiations is still uncertain. Our businesses have been proactive in addressing the potential impacts of tariffs, including targeted pricing initiatives, strategic adjustments to our global supply chains, and leveraging our worldwide manufacturing footprint to localize production and adapt to changing demand patterns. The recent tariff modifications did not materially impact our results for the first nine months of 2025, however, as the situation continues to evolve, we cannot be certain of the outcome, which could adversely impact demand for our products, costs, inflation, customers, suppliers, and the overall global economy. We continue to monitor and analyze the impacts of the tariffs and will continue to implement appropriate actions as necessary to mitigate their effects.\nResults of Operations\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2025, the Company posted record sales, operating income, orders, and backlog  as well as strong operating margins. Contributions from the acquisitions of Virtek Vision International (\"Virtek\") in October 2024, Kern Microtechnik (\"Kern\") in January 2025, and FARO Technologies (\"FARO\") in July 2025, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives had a positive impact on the third quarter of 2025 results.

Integration costs are recorded in Cost of sales and primarily include employee severance, change in control costs, and  fair-value inventory adjustments.
