Such net product sales are recorded by us or others, as further described in the footnotes to the table. We believe the information in the table is useful to investors as it demonstrates our pipeline productivity and our ability to innovate, discover, and develop new products, and bring those products to market either alone or based on contractual arrangements with other parties, which has a direct impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The table also shows the degree to which we, a collaborator, and/or a licensee is currently commercializing the products discovered by Regeneron. In addition, this information allows management and investors to assess the commercial trends and developments impacting Regeneron-discovered products. In arrangements where our collaborator or licensee is currently commercializing such products and is recording net product sales as a result, the net product sales shown in the table also are an important metric for management's review and assessment of (i) the revenues we record for our share of profits and/or royalties from such sales and (ii) the impact of our obligation to supply commercial product to certain of these collaborators or licensees.\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n(In millions)\nU.S.\nROW\n(f)\nTotal\nU.S.\nROW\nTotal\n(Total Sales)\nEYLEA HD\n(a)\n$\n430.6 \n$\n232.4 \n$\n663.0 \n$\n392.3 \n$\n75.2 \n$\n467.5 \n42\n%\nEYLEA\n(a)\n$\n680.6 \n$\n621.4 \n$\n1,302.0 \n$\n1,144.6 \n$\n856.5 \n$\n2,001.1 \n(35\n%)\nTotal EYLEA HD and EYLEA\n$\n1,111.2 \n$\n853.8 \n$\n1,965.0 \n$\n1,536.9 \n$\n931.7 \n$\n2,468.6 \n(20\n%)\nDupixent\n(b)\n$\n3,618.8 \n$\n1,238.2 \n$\n4,857.0 \n$\n2,824.7 \n$\n992.5 \n$\n3,817.2 \n27\n%\nLibtayo\n(c)\n$\n219.1 \n$\n146.1 \n$\n365.2 \n$\n194.5 \n$\n94.1 \n$\n288.6 \n27\n%\nPraluent\n(d)\n$\n67.7 \n$\n148.0 \n$\n215.7 \n$\n52.9 \n$\n138.5 \n$\n191.4 \n13\n%\nKevzara\n(b)\n$\n102.9 \n$\n51.1 \n$\n154.0 \n$\n72.7 \n$\n47.4 \n$\n120.1 \n28\n%\nOther products\n(e)\n$\n43.9 \n$\n28.0 \n$\n71.9 \n$\n68.2 \n$\n24.4 \n$\n92.6 \n(22\n%)\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n(In millions)\nU.S.\nROW\nTotal\nU.S.\nROW\nTotal\n(Total Sales)\nEYLEA HD\n(a)\n$\n1,130.6 \n$\n620.5 \n$\n1,751.1 \n$\n896.5 \n$\n149.5 \n$\n1,046.0 \n67\n%\nEYLEA\n(a)\n$\n2,170.9 \n$\n2,068.8 \n$\n4,239.7 \n$\n3,576.7 \n$\n2,539.4 \n$\n6,116.1 \n(31\n%)\nTotal EYLEA HD and EYLEA\n$\n3,301.5 \n$\n2,689.3 \n$\n5,990.8 \n$\n4,473.2 \n$\n2,688.9 \n$\n7,162.1 \n(16\n%)\nDupixent\n(b)\n$\n9,453.2 \n$\n3,414.0 \n$\n12,867.2 \n$\n7,652.9 \n$\n2,797.5 \n$\n10,450.4 \n23\n%\nLibtayo\n(c)\n$\n659.4 \n$\n367.4 \n$\n1,026.8 \n$\n536.1 \n$\n313.8 \n$\n849.9 \n21\n%\nPraluent\n(d)\n$\n190.3 \n$\n440.7 \n$\n631.0 \n$\n179.0 \n$\n405.6 \n$\n584.6 \n8\n%\nKevzara\n(b)\n$\n271.4 \n$\n151.2 \n$\n422.6 \n$\n187.8 \n$\n136.1 \n$\n323.9 \n30\n%\nOther products\n(e)\n$\n117.1 \n$\n81.5 \n$\n198.6 \n$\n124.4 \n$\n65.2 \n$\n189.6 \n5\n%\n(a)\n We record net product sales of EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the United States, and Bayer records net product sales outside the United States.

The delay resulted from observations from a July 2025 FDA general site inspection (not specific to EYLEA HD) at Catalent Indiana, LLC (\"Catalent\"), part of Novo Nordisk A/S, the manufacturing filler in the EYLEA HD BLA. The FDA extended the review periods after determining that the information submitted by the manufacturing filler in August 2025 to address the observations constituted a major amendment to each regulatory application.\nIn October 2025, the Company was notified by Catalent that they received an official action indicated (\"OAI\") letter from the FDA citing unresolved issues related to a July 2025 FDA general site inspection. On October 27, 2025, the FDA issued a CRL for the pre-filled syringe sBLA. The sole approvability issue cited in the CRL relates to unresolved inspection findings at Catalent. The Company is planning to submit by January 2026 an application to include a new pre-filled syringe manufacturing filler in the EYLEA HD BLA. \nIn addition, the Company has submitted an application to include an additional vial filler, should this be needed for approval of every-four-week dosing and RVO label enhancements, with an FDA decision regarding this new vial filler expected by late December 2025. \nItepekimab\nIn May 2025, the Company and Sanofi announced that a Phase 3 trial, AERIFY-1, in adults who were former smokers with inadequately controlled COPD met the primary endpoint of significantly reducing moderate or severe acute exacerbations by 27% compared to placebo at week 52, a clinically meaningful benefit. A second Phase 3 trial, AERIFY-2, did not meet the same primary endpoint, although a benefit was seen earlier in the trial. The safety profile of itepekimab observed in the Phase 3 trials was consistent with prior clinical trials. The Company and Sanofi are evaluating next steps.\nFianlimab\nIn April 2025, a pre-planned interim analysis was conducted on two ongoing Phase 2/3 studies evaluating the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab in first-line advanced NSCLC. Due to limited follow-up, the Phase 2 portion of the studies will continue unchanged until additional data are available. The next analyses for these studies are expected in the first half of 2026, at which time a decision whether to advance to Phase 3 is expected to be made. No new safety signals were observed in either study.\nOrdspono (odronextamab)\nOn July 30, 2025, the FDA issued a CRL for the BLA for odronextamab in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, which was also impacted by the Catalent Indiana LLC site inspection (as described in the \"EYLEA HD\" section above).\nCollaboration, License, and Other Agreements\nSanofi\nWe are collaborating with Sanofi on the global development and commercialization of Dupixent, Kevzara, and itepekimab (the \"Antibody Collaboration\"). Under the terms of the Antibody Collaboration, Sanofi is generally responsible for funding 80% to 100% of agreed-upon development costs. We are obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 30% to 50% of development expenses that were funded by Sanofi based on our share of collaboration profits; however, we are only required to apply 20% of our share of profits from the collaboration each calendar quarter to reimburse Sanofi for these development expenses. As of September 30, 2025, the total amount of our contingent reimbursement obligation to Sanofi (i.e., \"development balance\") in connection with such development expenses was approximately $905 million. \nUnder our collaboration agreement, Sanofi records product sales for commercialized products, and we have the right to co-commercialize such products on a country-by-country basis. We co-commercialize Dupixent in the United States and in certain countries outside the United States. We supply certain commercial bulk product to Sanofi. We and Sanofi equally share profits from sales within the United States, and share profits outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (Sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (Sanofi)/45% (us). \n36\nTable\n of Contents\nBayer \nWe and Bayer are parties to a license and collaboration agreement for the global development and commercialization of EYLEA 8 mg and EYLEA outside the United States. Agreed-upon development expenses incurred by the Company and Bayer are generally shared equally. Bayer is responsible for commercialization activities outside the United States, and the companies share equally in profits from such sales.\nWe are obligated to reimburse Bayer for 50% of the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from our share of the collaboration profits. The reimbursement payment in any quarter will equal 5% of the then outstanding repayment obligation, but never more than our share of the collaboration profits in the quarter unless we elect to reimburse Bayer at a faster rate. \nWithin the United States, we retain exclusive commercialization rights and are entitled to all profits from such sales.\nAlnylam\nWe and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are parties to a collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize RNAi the\nrapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing therapeutic disease targets expressed in the eye and central nervous system, in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration, the parties perform discovery research until designation of lead candidates. Following designation of a lead candidate, the parties may further advance such lead candidate under either a co-development and co-commercialization agreement or a license agreement. The initial target nomination and discovery period of five years has been automatically extended until the earlier of seven years from the effective date of the collaboration or the achievement of certain milestones (the \"Research Term\"). In addition, we have an option to extend the Research Term for an additional five-year period for a research extension fee of $300.0 million.\nWe have also entered into various license agreements with Alnylam, with us as the licensee, including for cemdisiran (a small interfering RNA (\"siRNA\") therapeutic ta\nrgeting the C5 component of the human complement pathway) as a monotherapy and for a combination consisting of cemdisiran and pozelimab.\nIntellia\nWe and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. are parties to a license and collaboration agreement to advance CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology for \nin vivo\n therapeutic development, including therapies focused on neurological and muscular diseases. We have the right to select targets under the license and collaboration agreement until April 2026.\nIntellia leads the design of the editing methodology, we lead the design of the targeted viral vector delivery approach, and the parties share costs. Each company has the opportunity to lead potential development and commercialization of product candidates for a target, and the company that is not leading development and commercialization will have the option to enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement for the target.\nNex-z, which is in clinical development, is subject to a co-development and co-commercialization arrangement pursuant to which Intellia leads development activities and the parties share development expenses 75% (Intellia)/25% (us). If nex-z is commercialized, Intellia will lead commercialization activities and we will be entitled to 25% of any profits. \nHansoh\nIn July 2025, our license agreement with Hansoh Pharmaceuticals Group Company Limited to acquire development and commercial rights outside of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau for HS-20094 (a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist currently in Phase 3 clinical development in China) became effective. In-licensing a late-stage GLP-1/GIP agonist enables us to study combinations with our products and product candidates in order to address muscle loss and potentially other comorbidities of obesity, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and liver conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an $80.0 million up-front payment in July 2025. In addition, we are obligated to make additional payments upon achievement of development, regulatory, and sales milestones, as well as a low double-digit royalty on sales.\nGeneral\nOur ability to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on the success in commercializing our products, including EYLEA HD and Dupixent. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, and our research and development activities and related costs which are not reimbursed by collaborators are expected to expand and require additional resources. We also expect to incur substantial costs related to the commercialization of our marketed products. Our financial results may fluctuate from \n37\nTable\n of Contents\nquarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our products; the scope and progress of our research and development efforts; the timing of certain expenses; the continuation of our collaborations, in particular with Sanofi and Bayer, including our share of collaboration profits from sales of commercialized products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators; and the amount of income tax expense we incur, which is partly dependent on the profits or losses we earn in each of the countries in which we operate. There is uncertainty surrounding whether or when new products or new indications for marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such products and whether or when they may become profitable.\nResults of Operations\n \nNet Income\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions, except per share data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenues\n$\n3,754.3 \n$\n3,720.7 \n$\n10,458.6 \n$\n10,412.8 \nOperating expenses\n2,727.5 \n2,541.2 \n7,760.6 \n7,412.3 \nIncome from operations\n1,026.8 \n1,179.5 \n2,698.0 \n3,000.5 \nOther income (expense)\n736.5 \n313.5 \n1,489.0 \n821.3 \nIncome before income taxes\n1,763.3 \n1,493.0 \n4,187.0 \n3,821.8 \nIncome tax expense\n303.3 \n152.4 \n526.7 \n326.9 \nNet income\n$\n1,460.0 \n$\n1,340.6 \n$\n3,660.3 \n$\n3,494.9 \nNet income per share - diluted\n$\n13.62 \n$\n11.54 \n$\n33.61 \n$\n30.23 \nRevenues\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\nNet product sales:\nEYLEA HD - U.S.\n$\n430.6 \n$\n392.3 \n$\n38.3 \n$\n1,130.6 \n$\n896.5 \n$\n234.1 \nEYLEA - U.S.\n680.6 \n1,144.6 \n(464.0)\n2,170.9 \n3,576.7 \n(1,405.8)\nTotal EYLEA HD and EYLEA - U.S.\n1,111.2 \n1,536.9 \n(425.7)\n3,301.5 \n4,473.2 \n(1,171.7)\nLibtayo - U.S.\n219.1 \n194.5 \n24.6 \n659.4 \n536.1 \n123.3 \nLibtayo - ROW\n146.1 \n94.1 \n52.0 \n367.4 \n313.8 \n53.6 \nTotal Libtayo - Global\n365.2 \n288.6 \n76.6 \n1,026.8 \n849.9 \n176.9 \nPraluent - U.S.\n67.7 \n52.9 \n14.8 \n190.3 \n179.0 \n11.3 \nEvkeeza - U.S.\n42.8 \n32.4 \n10.4 \n114.9 \n87.6 \n27.3 \nInmazeb - U.S.\n— \n35.6 \n(35.6)\n— \n36.6 \n(36.6)\nOther products - Global\n0.8 \n— \n0.8 \n0.8 \n— \n0.8 \nTotal net product sales\n$\n1,587.7 \n$\n1,946.4 \n$\n(358.7)\n$\n4,634.3 \n$\n5,626.3 \n$\n(992.0)\nCollaboration revenue:\nSanofi\n$\n1,617.0 \n$\n1,263.4 \n$\n353.6 \n$\n4,243.8 \n$\n3,318.8 \n$\n925.0 \nBayer \n344.8 \n390.8 \n(46.0)\n1,103.7 \n1,121.9 \n(18.2)\nOther\n6.6 \n5.9 \n0.7 \n12.8 \n10.2 \n2.6 \nOther revenue\n198.2 \n114.2 \n84.0 \n464.0 \n335.6 \n128.4 \nTotal revenues\n$\n3,754.3 \n$\n3,720.7 \n$\n33.6 \n$\n10,458.6 \n$\n10,412.8 \n$\n45.8 \n38\nTable\n of Contents\nNet Product Sales\nNet product sales of EYLEA HD increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, due to higher sales volumes, partly offset by a lower net selling price.\nNet product sales of EYLEA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, were negatively impacted by (i) lower sales volumes as a result of continued competitive pressures (as described below), loss in market share to compounded bevacizumab due to patient affordability constraints, and the continued transition of patients to EYLEA HD, and (ii) a lower net selling price.\nEYLEA net product sales have been, and are likely to continue to be, negatively impacted by increased competition from other anti-VEGF products, including biosimilars, as well as the transition of patients from EYLEA to EYLEA HD. The magnitude and duration of such impact is presently unknown. For more information, see Part II, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Marketed Products, Product Candidates, and New Indications for Our Marketed Products - \nWe are substantially dependent on the success of EYLEA, EYLEA HD, and Dupixent\n\"\n \nand\n \n\"\nThe commercial success of our products and product candidates is subject to significant competition - \nMarketed Products.\" In addition, if independent not-for-profit patient assistance funds that provide copay assistance are unable to support eligible patients, this will likely have a continued negative impact on patient affordability resulting in lower utilization of higher-cost anti-VEGF agents.\nCollaboration Revenue\nSanofi Collaboration Revenue\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRegeneron's share of profits\n$\n1,455.5 \n$\n1,088.3 \n$\n3,755.7 \n$\n2,880.6 \nReimbursement for manufacturing of commercial supplies\n(a)\n161.5 \n175.1 \n488.1 \n438.2 \nTotal Sanofi collaboration revenue\n$\n1,617.0 \n$\n1,263.4 \n$\n4,243.8 \n$\n3,318.8 \n(a)\n Corresponding costs incurred by the Company in connection with such manufacturing is recorded within Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing\nGlobal net product sales of Dupixent and Kevzara are recorded by Sanofi, and we and Sanofi share profits on such sales.\nRegeneron's share of profits in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara is summarized below: \nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nDupixent and Kevzara net product sales\n$\n5,011.0 \n$\n3,937.3 \n$\n13,289.8 \n$\n10,774.3 \nRegeneron's share of collaboration profits in connection with commercialization of antibodies \n$\n1,723.6 \n$\n1,263.4 \n$\n4,400.5 \n$\n3,338.5 \nReimbursement of development expenses incurred by Sanofi in accordance with Regeneron's payment obligation\n(a)\n(268.1)\n(175.1)\n(644.8)\n(457.9)\nRegeneron's share of profits\n$\n1,455.5 \n$\n1,088.3 \n$\n3,755.7 \n$\n2,880.6 \nRegeneron's share of profits as a percentage of Dupixent and Kevzara net product sales\n29%\n28%\n28%\n27%\n(a)\n See \"Collaboration, License, and Other Agreements - Sanofi\" above for additional details on our contingent reimbursement obligation\nThe increase in our share of profits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, was driven by higher profits associated with an increase in Dupixent sales. \n39\nTable\n of Contents\nBayer Collaboration Revenue\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRegeneron's share of profits\n$\n311.9 \n$\n367.6 \n$\n1,012.6 \n$\n1,054.5 \nReimbursement for manufacturing of commercial supplies\n(a)\n32.9 \n23.2 \n91.1 \n67.4 \nTotal Bayer collaboration revenue\n$\n344.8 \n$\n390.8 \n$\n1,103.7 \n$\n1,121.9 \n(a)\n Corresponding costs incurred by the Company in connection with such manufacturing is recorded within Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing\nBayer records net product sales of EYLEA 8 mg and EYLEA outside the United States, and we and Bayer share profits on such sales. \nRegeneron's share of profits in connection with commercialization of EYLEA 8 mg and EYLEA outside the United States is summarized below:\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nEYLEA 8 mg and EYLEA net product sales outside the United States \n$\n853.8 \n$\n931.7 \n$\n2,689.3 \n$\n2,688.9 \nRegeneron's share of collaboration profit from sales outside the United States\n$\n328.0 \n$\n384.2 \n$\n1,061.5 \n$\n1,103.7 \nReimbursement of development expenses incurred by Bayer in accordance with Regeneron's payment obligation\n(a)\n(16.1)\n(16.6)\n(48.9)\n(49.2)\nRegeneron's share of profits\n$\n311.9 \n$\n367.6 \n$\n1,012.6 \n$\n1,054.5 \nRegeneron's share of profits as a percentage of EYLEA 8 mg and EYLEA net product sales outside the United States\n37%\n39%\n38%\n39%\n(a)\n See \"Collaboration, License, and Other Agreements - Bayer\" above for additional details on our contingent reimbursement obligation\nThe decrease in our share of profits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, was driven by lower profits associated with a decrease in EYLEA sales outside the United States. \nOther Revenue \nOther revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024.

Direct research and development expenses are comprised primarily of costs paid to third parties for clinical and product development activities, including costs related to preclinical research activities, clinical trials, and the portion of research and development expenses incurred by our collaborators that we are obligated to reimburse. Indirect research and development expenses have not been allocated directly to each program, and primarily consist of costs to compensate personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs to maintain our facilities, and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects. Clinical manufacturing costs primarily consist of costs to manufacture bulk drug product for clinical development purposes as well as related drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs. Clinical manufacturing costs also include pre-launch commercial supplies which did not meet the criteria to be capitalized as inventory. The table below also includes reimbursements of research and development expenses by collaborators, as when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of such expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts in the period in which such costs are incurred.\n41\nTable\n of Contents\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n*\n$ Change\n2025\n2024\n*\n$ Change\nDirect research and development expenses:\nFianlimab\n$\n55.8 \n$\n53.4 \n$\n2.4 \n$\n155.3 \n$\n168.4 \n$\n(13.1)\nOrdspono (odronextamab)\n50.1 \n33.8 \n16.3 \n119.1 \n94.1 \n25.0 \nLynozyfic (linvoseltamab)\n32.8 \n25.4 \n7.4 \n118.1 \n111.8 \n6.3 \nItepekimab\n28.1 \n24.2 \n3.9 \n90.9 \n67.8 \n23.1 \nDupixent (dupilumab)\n27.6 \n31.3 \n(3.7)\n81.1 \n96.4 \n(15.3)\nEYLEA HD (aflibercept) 8 mg\n21.1 \n28.9 \n(7.8)\n73.9 \n76.0 \n(2.1)\nLibtayo (cemiplimab)\n18.0 \n17.9 \n0.1 \n57.3 \n60.7 \n(3.4)\nTrevogrumab\n17.9 \n6.4 \n11.5 \n57.0 \n18.7 \n38.3 \nPozelimab\n16.5 \n17.6 \n(1.1)\n45.6 \n49.3 \n(3.7)\nOther product candidates in clinical development and other research programs\n186.4 \n147.5 \n38.9 \n498.4 \n415.3 \n83.1 \nTotal direct research and development expenses\n454.3 \n386.4 \n67.9 \n1,296.7 \n1,158.5 \n138.2 \nIndirect research and development expenses:\nPayroll and benefits\n438.3 \n407.8 \n30.5 \n1,339.5 \n1,249.2 \n90.3 \nLab supplies and other research and development costs\n67.5 \n63.0 \n4.5 \n192.4 \n175.4 \n17.0 \nOccupancy and other operating costs\n166.3 \n158.7 \n7.6 \n479.2 \n434.9 \n44.3 \nTotal indirect research and development expenses\n672.1 \n629.5 \n42.6 \n2,011.1 \n1,859.5 \n151.6 \nClinical manufacturing costs\n381.4 \n306.6 \n74.8 \n1,028.8 \n841.3 \n187.5 \nReimbursement of research and development expenses by collaborators\n(32.8)\n(51.0)\n18.2 \n(112.5)\n(139.4)\n26.9 \nTotal research and development expenses\n$\n1,475.0 \n$\n1,271.5 \n$\n203.5 \n$\n4,224.1 \n$\n3,719.9 \n$\n504.2 \n*\n Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation\nResearch and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $125.1 million and $123.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $405.1 million and $369.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThere are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in Part II, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\" There is also variability in the duration and costs necessary to develop a product candidate, potential opportunities and/or uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, and the estimated cost and scope of the projects. The lengthy process of seeking FDA and other applicable approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. We are unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.\n42\nTable\n of Contents\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (\"IPR&D\") Expenses\nAcquired IPR&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 included an $80.0 million up-front payment in connection with our license agreement with Hansoh Pharmaceuticals Group Company Limited.\nAcquired IPR&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a $45.0 million development milestone in connection with our collaboration agreement with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, Inc.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, primarily due to lower charitable contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. Selling, general, and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $92.0 million and $83.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $279.0 million and $251.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nCost of Goods Sold\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions, except gross margin on net product sales)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nCost of goods sold\n$\n281.0\n$\n262.3\n$\n822.1\n$\n760.5\nGross margin on net product sales\n(a)\n82%\n87%\n82%\n86%\n(a)\n \nGross margin on net product sales represents gross profit expressed as a percentage of total net product sales recorded by the Company. Gross profit is calculated as net product sales (see \"Net Product Sales\" section above) less cost of goods sold.\nGross margin on net product sales decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, partly due to ongoing investments to support our manufacturing operations. In addition, gross margin on net product sales decreased due to higher amortization expense associated with our Libtayo intangible asset as each quarter we record additions to the intangible asset related to royalties due to Sanofi.\nOther Operating (Income) Expense\nOther operating (income) expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a charge of $37.9 million related to the increase in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability recognized in connection with our 2023 acquisition of Decibel Therapeutics, Inc.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nGains on marketable and other securities, net\n$\n577.7 \n$\n134.7 \n$\n967.6 \n$\n331.2 \nInterest income\n175.1 \n187.4 \n523.5 \n528.3 \nOther\n3.0 \n5.2 \n29.5 \n6.5 \nOther income (expense), net\n755.8 \n327.3 \n1,520.6 \n866.0 \nInterest expense\n(19.3)\n(13.8)\n(31.6)\n(44.7)\nTotal other income (expense)\n$\n736.5 \n$\n313.5 \n$\n1,489.0 \n$\n821.3 \n43\nTable\n of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions, except effective tax rate)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIncome tax expense\n$\n303.3\n$\n152.4\n$\n526.7\n$\n326.9\nEffective tax rate\n17.2\n%\n10.2\n%\n12.6\n%\n8.6\n%\nOn July 4, 2025, bill H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" or \"OBBBA,\" was signed into law, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others in 2026. The OBBBA significantly revises U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, restoring the option for immediate expense recognition for U.S.-based research and development expenditures and making permanent the ability to claim first-year bonus depreciation on qualified property. The OBBBA also modifies U.S. taxation on foreign earnings by, among other things, changing the tax rates for global intangible low-taxed income (now known as Net CFC Tested Income) and foreign-derived intangible income (now known as foreign-derived deduction eligible income), modifying the allocation of expenses in calculating foreign tax credits, as well as changing foreign tax credit limitations. As a result of the OBBBA being signed into law, we recognized a charge of $44.5 million in the third quarter of 2025 related to the re-measurement of our U.S. net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was positively impacted, compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily by income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and federal tax credits for research activities, partially offset by the impact of the OBBBA being signed into law. In addition, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was positively impacted by the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions recognized upon the effective settlement of the IRS audit of our 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns in the second quarter of 2025, which reduced our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 by 1.4%.\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, was primarily impacted by the net change in uncertain tax positions, as well as lower tax benefits from less stock option exercises and the enactment of the OBBBA.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial condition is summarized as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,506.4 \n$\n2,488.2 \n$\n18.2 \nMarketable securities - current \n5,937.2 \n6,524.3 \n(587.1)\nMarketable securities - noncurrent\n10,285.7 \n8,900.1 \n1,385.6 \n$\n18,729.3 \n$\n17,912.6 \n$\n816.7 \nWorking capital:\nCurrent assets\n$\n17,980.7 \n$\n18,660.9 \n$\n(680.2)\nCurrent liabilities\n4,425.1 \n3,944.3 \n480.8 \n$\n13,555.6 \n$\n14,716.6 \n$\n(1,161.0)\nBorrowings and finance lease liabilities:\nLong-term debt\n$\n1,985.5 \n$\n1,984.4 \n$\n1.1 \nFinance lease liabilities\n$\n720.0 \n$\n720.0 \n$\n— \nAs of September 30, 2025, we also had borrowing availability of $750.0 million under a revolving credit facility.\n44\nTable\n of Contents\nSources and Uses of Cash for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\nCash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n3,808.2 \n$\n3,157.7 \n$\n650.5 \nInvesting activities\n$\n(849.4)\n$\n(2,818.7)\n$\n1,969.3 \nFinancing activities\n$\n(2,935.3)\n$\n(1,065.0)\n$\n(1,870.3)\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included costs incurred in connection with the expansion of our research, preclinical manufacturing, and support facilities at our Tarrytown, New York corporate headquarters. We expect to incur capital expenditures of $850 million to $890 million for the full year of 2025.\nPayments for intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included $155.0 million related to our purchase of an FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher from a third party in the second quarter of 2025. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nShare Repurchase Programs\nIn each of April 2024 and February 2025, our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to $3.0 billion of our Common Stock (up to $6.0 billion in the aggregate). The programs have no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2025, $2.156 billion remained available for share repurchases under the programs.\nDividends\nIn each of the first, second, and third quarters of 2025, our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.88 per share on our Common Stock and Class A Stock. Each quarterly dividend was paid to our shareholders in the quarter in which the dividend was declared.\nAdditionally, in October 2025, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.88 per share on our Common Stock and Class A Stock. The dividend will be payable on December 5, 2025 to our shareholders of record as of November 20, 2025.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nA summary of critical accounting estimates is presented in Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (filed February 5, 2025). There have been no material changes to critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nFuture Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a description of recently issued accounting standards."
