MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFortive Corporation (“Fortive,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) innovates essential technologies to keep the world safe and productive. Our strategic segments - Intelligent Operating Solutions (“IOS”) and Advanced Healthcare Solutions (“AHS”) - include iconic inventor brands with leading positions in their markets. Our businesses design, develop, manufacture, and market products, software, and services, building upon leading brand names, innovative technologies, and strong market positions. Our research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service, and administrative facilities are located in approximately 50 countries around the world.\nPrecision Technologies Separation\nOn June 28, 2025 (the “Distribution Date”), the Company completed the separation (the “Separation” or the “PT Separation”) of its former Precision Technologies segment by distributing to Fortive shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Ralliant Corporation (“Ralliant”), the entity incorporated to hold the PT businesses. The accounting requirements for reporting Ralliant as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this report refer to continuing operations. Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the MD&A and consolidated financial statements included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our MD&A is divided into five sections:\n•\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nINFORMATION RELATING TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \nCertain statements included or incorporated by reference in this quarterly report, in other documents we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in our press releases, webcasts, conference calls, materials delivered to shareholders and other communications, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States federal securities laws. All statements other than historical factual information are forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenue, expenses, profit, profit margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, our liquidity position or other financial measures; impact of government actions, including tariffs, other trade policies, government spending and tax laws; management’s plans and strategies for future operations, including statements relating to anticipated operating performance, cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic opportunities, stock repurchases, and dividends; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into, including the expected impact of trade and tariff policies; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions, including expected impact of inflation or interest rate changes; impact of geopolitical events and other hostilities; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address events or developments that we intend or believe will or may occur in the future. Terminology, such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “should,” “could,” “intend,” “will,” “plan,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “may,” “possible,” “potential,” “forecast” and “positioned” and similar references to future periods, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors they believe to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not \n26\nTable of Contents\nplace undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those envisaged in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\nRisk Related to Our Business Operations\n•\nConditions in the global economy, the markets we serve, and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n•\nIf we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity, supply chain management or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions, international trade policies, customer demand, prolonged government shutdown, and supply chain disruptions, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components, and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. \n•\nOur financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities or components that we use in our operations.\n•\nOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated, or experience cyclicality.\n•\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.\n•\nOur growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.\n•\nOur ability to attract, develop, and retain senior leaders and other key employees is critical to our success.\n•\nDisruptions in, or breaches in security of, our information technology systems have adversely affected, and in the future could adversely affect, our business.\n•\nDefects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products (including software) or services could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results.\n•\nAdverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns, or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial results.\n•\nOur restructuring activities could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\n•\nWork stoppages, works council campaigns, and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.\n•\nIf we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.\n•\nIf we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\n•\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses, or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\n•\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial results.\n•\nClimate change, or legal or regulatory measures to address climate change, may negatively affect us.\n•\nWe use artificial intelligence in our business and in our products, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk Related to our International Operations\n•\nInternational economic, political, legal, trade policies, compliance, and business factors could negatively affect our financial results.\n27\nTable of Contents\n•\nTrade relations between the United States and other countries, including imposition of tariffs and related uncertainty thereof, and the impact on cost and demand resulting therefrom could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n•\nForeign currency exchange rates, including the volatility thereof, may adversely affect our financial results.\nRisk Related to Our Acquisitions, Investments, and Dispositions\n•\nAny inability to consummate acquisitions at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments and capital allocation that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.\n•\nOur acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures, and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial results.\n•\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.\n•\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial results.\n•\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Ralliant Corporation (“Ralliant”) and Vontier Corporation (“Vontier”) pursuant to the respective separation agreements could materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisk Related to Regulatory and Compliance Matters\n•\nChanges in industry standards and governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.\n•\nOur reputation, ability to do business, and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.\n•\nOur operations, products, and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health, and safety liabilities, costs, and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results.\n•\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation, including healthcare regulations; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial results and our business, including our reputation.\nRisk Related to Our Tax and Accounting Matters\n•\nChanges in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\n•\nWe could incur significant liability if our separation from Danaher, our separation of our Automation and Specialty business, our separation of Vontier, or our separation of Ralliant (collectively, the “Separation Transactions”) is determined to be a taxable transaction.\n•\nChanges in U.S. GAAP could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\n•\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nRisk Related to Our Financing Activities\n•\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt, and our debt obligations, including the cost of such debt, will increase further if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt, our credit rating declines, or if the applicable interest rates rise.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding reasons that actual results may differ materially from the results, developments, and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the report, document, press release, webcast, call, materials or other communication in which they are made (or such earlier date as may be specified in such statement). We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nFortive is a multinational business with global operations with approximately 44% of our sales derived from customers outside the United States in 2024. As a company with global operations, our businesses are affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic, trade policies, fiscal policies, regulatory, and political factors. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of products, software, and services we offer, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country, except for the United States, on our operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided, and geographies served, we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including their sales, to the extent possible, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.\nAs a result of our geographic and industry diversity, we face a variety of opportunities and challenges, including technological development in most of the markets we serve, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in growing markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, trade policies, and consolidation of our competitors. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth and profitability will depend, in particular, on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments, identify, consummate, and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services, and software, expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, attract relevant talent and retain, grow, and empower our talented workforce, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world.\nSegment Presentation\nThe IOS segment provides advanced instrumentation, software and services to tens of thousands of customers enabling their mission-critical workflows. The AHS segment supplies critical workflow solutions enabling healthcare providers to deliver exceptional patient care more efficiently. Refer to Note 10 of the consolidated condensed financial statements for further description of each segment.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn this report, references to sales from existing businesses (“core revenue”) refer to sales from operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) the impact from acquired and divested businesses and (2) the impact of foreign currency translation. References to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, less the amount of sales attributable to certain businesses or product lines that have been divested, or, at the time of reporting, are pending divestiture, but are not, and will not be, considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Core revenue should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \nManagement believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of core revenue provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisition and divestiture related items because the nature, size, and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from core revenue because the impact of currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility. Management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation may facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of long-term performance. References to sales volume from existing businesses refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.\n29\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Trends\nOur financial outlook is subject to various assumptions and risks, including but not limited to: ongoing geopolitical events; global economic and consumer trends and sentiments; monetary policies; inflationary pressures on expenses and pricing; uncertainties in governmental policies on international trade, regulations, sanctions, and healthcare; prolonged government shutdown; operational challenges from tariffs; foreign exchange rate volatility, including the impact of unhedged foreign currency debts; reduction in U.S. government spending due to H.R.1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; and overall fiscal policies, including investment and taxation policy initiatives being considered in the U.S.; the incremental impacts of the Pillar Two initiative from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”); and the impact from the Separation.\nThe development of tariffs and trade relations remains uncertain. While most of the reciprocal tariffs have been implemented in August of 2025, certain of these tariffs have been temporarily postponed until November of 2025, with periodic escalation. For additional discussion of risks related to tariffs and trade relations, please refer to the risk factor, “Trade relations between the United States and other countries, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs and related uncertainty thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results” in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2025.\nWe continue to monitor the conditions above and deploy the Fortive Business System (“FBS”), including tools and processes to leverage existing sourcing strategies and optimize production and logistics to actively manage these challenges and utilize pricing, cost and productivity actions and other countermeasures designed to offset the aforementioned dynamics.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales Growth\nThe following table summarizes total aggregate year-over-year sales growth and the components thereof for the third quarter as compared to the comparable period of 2024:\nComponents of Sales Growth\n% Change Three Months Ended September 26, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 Period\n% Change Nine Months Ended September 26, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 Period\nTotal revenue growth (GAAP)\n2.3\n \n%\n0.9\n \n%\nExcluding impact of:\nDivestitures\n0.3 \n%\n0.2 \n%\nCurrency exchange rates\n(0.7)\n%\n— \n%\nCore revenue growth (Non-GAAP)\n1.9\n \n%\n1.1\n \n%\nSales in the three months ended September 26, 2025 (the “quarter” or the “third quarter”) were driven by favorable pricing of 2.6%, partially offset by volume decline of 0.7%. Sales in the nine months ended September 26, 2025 (“year-to-date period”) were driven by favorable pricing of 2.3%, partially offset by volume decline of 1.2%. \nGeographically, in the third quarter, core revenue growth was driven primarily by strengthening demand in North America, led by the IOS segment, partially offset by modest declines in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), mostly in Europe. In the year-to-date period, core revenue growth was driven by moderate growth in North America in both segments, partially offset by modest declines in EMEA, mostly in Europe. \nFor further detail, refer to the Intelligent Operating Solutions and Advanced Healthcare Solutions sections below.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOperating Profit Margins\nIn the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively, operating profit margin was 15.5% and 16.3%, comparing to 17.1% and 16.8% in the comparable period of 2024, resulting in a decrease of 160 basis points and 50 basis points: \n•\nThe year-over-year increase in price and gains from productivity measures through our FBS initiatives partially offset by volume declines, higher employee compensation, and unfavorable impacts from tariffs net of countermeasures — favorable 205 basis points and 105 basis points, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively\n•\nThe year-over year effect of all other items in the \nthird quarter \nincluding -370 basis points primarily from incremental stock-based compensation costs related to the Separation, +25 basis points from amortization of existing businesses and -20 basis points in discrete restructuring charges \n— \nunfavorable 365\n basis points\n \n•\nThe year-over year effect of all other items in the year-to-date period including -125 basis points primarily from \nincremental stock-based compensation costs related to the Separation\n, -45 basis points in discrete restructuring charges, +15 basis points from amortization of existing businesses — unfavorable 155 basis points\nINTELLIGENT OPERATING SOLUTIONS\nSelected Financial Data\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n($ in millions)\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSales\n$\n698.8\n$\n681.3\n$\n2,086.6\n$\n2,062.3\nOperating profit\n180.7\n169.0\n526.1\n507.2\nDepreciation\n12.7\n10.7\n36.3\n30.3\nAmortization\n46.4\n46.9\n139.6\n141.7\nOperating profit as a % of sales\n25.9 \n%\n24.8 \n%\n25.2 \n%\n24.6 \n%\nDepreciation as a % of sales\n1.8 \n%\n1.6 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n1.5 \n%\nAmortization as a % of sales\n6.6 \n%\n6.9 \n%\n6.7 \n%\n6.9 \n%\nComponents of Sales Growth\n \n% Change Three Months Ended September 26, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 Period\n% Change Nine Months Ended September 26, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 Period\nTotal revenue growth (GAAP)\n2.6\n \n%\n1.2\n \n%\nExcluding impact of:\nDivestitures\n0.5 \n%\n0.3 \n%\nCurrency exchange rates\n(0.9)\n%\n(0.2)\n%\nCore revenue growth (Non-GAAP)\n2.2\n \n%\n1.3\n \n%\nSales growth in the third quarter and year-to-date period were driven by favorable pricing of 2.4%, and 2.1%, respectively, including countermeasures to mitigate unfavorable tariff impacts. Volume declined slightly in the third quarter, and declined modestly in the year-to-date period, driven by declines in professional instrumentation, partially offset by increases in facilities and asset lifecycle software and gas detection. \nGeographically, in the third quarter, core revenue growth was driven primarily by solid growth in North America, partially offset by declines in EMEA, mostly in Europe. In the year to date period, core revenue growth was driven by moderate growth in North America, partially offset by modest declines in EMEA, mostly in Europe.\nIn the third quarter and year-to-date period, operating profit margin increased 110 basis points and 60 basis points, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2024: \n•\nThe year-over-year increase in price and gains achieved from productivity measures through our FBS initiatives partially offset by volume decline, higher employee compensation, and unfavorable impact from tariffs net of \n31\nTable of Contents\ncountermeasures — favorable 110 basis points and 90 basis points, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively\n•\nThe year-over year effect of all other items in the third quarter, including +20 basis points from amortization of existing businesses, offset by -20 basis points in discrete restructuring charges — relatively flat\n•\nThe year-over year effect of all other items in the year-to-date period, including -55 basis points in discrete restructuring charges, offset by +20 basis points from amortization from existing businesses, and +5 basis points from lower acquisition and divestiture-related costs — unfavorable 30 basis points\nADVANCED HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS\nSelected Financial Data\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n($ in millions)\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSales\n$\n328.3\n$\n322.4\n$\n950.0\n$\n945.8\nOperating profit\n42.5\n36.7\n100.0\n95.8\nDepreciation\n4.5\n4.8\n14.7\n15.0\nAmortization\n45.1\n45.1\n134.7\n135.4\nOperating profit as a % of sales\n12.9 \n%\n11.4 \n%\n10.5 \n%\n10.1 \n%\nDepreciation as a % of sales\n1.4 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nAmortization as a % of sales\n13.7 \n%\n14.0 \n%\n14.2 \n%\n14.3 \n%\nComponents of Sales Growth\n \n% Change Three Months Ended September 26, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 period\n% Change Nine Months Ended September 26, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 Period\nTotal revenue growth (GAAP)\n1.9\n \n%\n0.4\n \n%\nExcluding impact of:\nCurrency exchange rates\n(0.8)\n%\n0.1 \n%\nCore revenue growth (Non-GAAP)\n1.1\n \n%\n0.5\n \n%\nSales growth in the third quarter was primarily driven by favorable pricing of 3.0%.

Sales growth in the year-to-date period was driven by favorable pricing of 2.8%. Volume declined moderately resulting from demand decline in sterilization equipment and biomedical test products partially offset by growth in healthcare software and dosimetry services. \nGeographically, in the third quarter, core revenue growth was driven by a modest increase in North America. In the year-to-date period, core revenue was relatively stable with modest increases in North America mostly offset by moderate declines in Latin America and EMEA driven mostly by Europe. \nIn the third quarter and year-to-date period, operating profit margin increased 150 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2024: \n•\nYear-over-year increases due to favorable pricing, gains from productivity measures through our FBS initiatives partially offset by moderate volume decline and higher employee compensation — favorable 120 basis points and favorable 30 basis points, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively\n•\nThe year-over-year effect of amortization from existing businesses — favorable 30 basis points and 10 basis points, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively\n32\nTable of Contents\nCOST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n($ in millions)\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSales\n$\n1,027.1 \n$\n1,003.7 \n$\n3,036.6 \n$\n3,008.1 \nCost of sales\n(377.9)\n(362.2)\n(1,104.4)\n(1,084.5)\nGross profit\n$\n649.2 \n$\n641.5 \n$\n1,932.2 \n$\n1,923.6 \nGross profit margin\n63.2 \n%\n63.9 \n%\n63.6 \n%\n63.9 \n%\nThe year-over-year increase in gross profit during both the third quarter and year-to-date period was driven by favorable pricing and gains from productivity measures and FBS initiatives, partially offset by volume decline, higher employee compensation, di\nscrete restructuring charges, and unfavorable tariff impacts. \nOPERATING EXPENSES\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n($ in millions)\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSales\n$\n1,027.1\n$\n1,003.7\n$\n3,036.6\n$\n3,008.1\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)\n427.6\n407.5\n1,244.3\n1,233.4\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\n62.0\n62.0\n193.2\n186.1\nSG&A as a % of sales\n41.6 \n%\n40.6 \n%\n41.0 \n%\n41.0 \n%\nR&D as a % of sales\n6.0 \n%\n6.2 \n%\n6.4 \n%\n6.2 \n%\nThe year-over-year increase in SG&A during both the third quarter and year-to-date period were primarily due to \nincremental stock-based compen\nsation related to the Separation incurred in 2025, higher employee compensation costs, and discrete restructuring charges, all partially offset by benefits from productivity measures through our FBS initiatives. \nR&D, consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs, remained relatively flat during the third quarter and increased slightly during the year-to-date period as compared to the comparable period of 2024 due to ongoing investments in innovation.\nNON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\nInterest costs\nNet interest expense for the third quarter and year-to-date period was $25.4 million and $89.5 million as compared to $37.1 million and $119.8 million in the comparable periods in 2024. The year-over-year decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt and lower interest rates on floating rate debt instruments. For discussion of our outstanding indebtedness, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated condensed financial statements.\nOther non-operating income (expense), net\nOther non-operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date period was $0.8 million and $3.1 million, as compared to expense of $25.8 million and $58.2 million in the comparable periods in 2024. The year-over-year change in both the third quarter and year-to-date was primarily due to losses from our equity investments recognized in the comparable prior year periods. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, there was a charitable contribution made to the Fortive Foundation, a related party, without any donor imposed conditions or restrictions.\nINCOME TAXES\nOur effective tax (benefit) rate for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2025 was 13.3% and 16.4%, respectively, as compared to (2.2)% and 11.3%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 26, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily related to changes in applicable statutory tax rates, resulting in a discrete benefit in the comparable prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 26, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was primarily related to changes in applicable statutory tax rates.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2025, differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the impact of credits and deductions provided by law, including those associated with state income taxes, and changes in our uncertain tax position reserves.\nGlobally, the Company monitors legislative action and OECD initiatives related to global taxation. The impact of the OECD framework for a “Pillar Two” global minimum corporate income tax rate of fifteen percent (15%) has been included within the provision for income taxes. On June 28, 2025, the OECD released a statement recognizing an agreement between OECD and the G20 to recognize the U.S. minimum tax rules to exempt U.S. multinationals certain portions of the Pillar Two framework. We continue to monitor further guidance and legislative developments related to the Pillar Two framework. \nH.R.1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted in the U.S on July 4, 2025 resulted in significant income tax provisions with effective dates spanning from 2025 through 2027. Changes from H.R.1 include modifications to allow for immediate expensing of certain business investments and provides certain permanent extensions and modifications to the U.S. international tax framework. There is no material impact of H.R.1 to our continuing operations financial statements. \nRepatriation\nForeign cumulative earnings remain subject to foreign remittance taxes. We have made an election regarding the amount of earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs, local law restrictions, high foreign remittance costs, previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions, or future growth needs. For most of our foreign operations, we make an assertion regarding the amount of earnings in excess of intended repatriation that are expected to be held for indefinite reinvestment. No provisions for foreign remittance taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely. The amount of foreign remittance taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given local law restrictions that may apply to a portion of such earnings, unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the applicable restriction periods caused by applicable local corporate law for cash repatriation, and the various tax planning alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME \nComprehensive income decreased by $267 million during the third quarter as compared to the comparable period in 2024 due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency translation of $100 million, partially offset by a $6 million increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Additionally, there was a $172 million decrease in net earnings from discontinued operations.\nComprehensive income decreased by $55 million during the year-to-date period as compared to the comparable period in 2024 due primarily to favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of $176 million and a $52 million increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Additionally, there was a $283 million decrease in net earnings from discontinued operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. We generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity, which consist of available cash, our revolving credit facility, and access to commercial paper, bank loans, and capital markets, will be sufficient to allow us to continue funding and investing in our existing businesses, consummate strategic acquisitions, execute strategic separations, repurchase common stock, make interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, fulfill our contractual obligations, and manage our capital structure on a short and long-term basis. \nAs of September 26, 2025, we held approximately $431 million of cash and equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less, of which approximately 93% was held outside of the United States. \nWe have generally satisfied any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash through issuances of commercial paper under our U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper program. Credit support for this program is provided by a five-year $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on October 18, 2027 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) which, to the extent not otherwise providing credit support for the commercial paper programs, can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2025, no borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.\nThe availability of the Revolving Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Commercial Paper Programs when we have outstanding \n34\nTable of Contents\nborrowings. We expect to limit any future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow, if needed, and repay any outstanding commercial paper as it matures. \nOn June 7, 2023, we filed with the SEC an “automatic shelf” registration statement (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). Under the Shelf Registration Statement, we may from time to time sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, purchase contracts, purchase units, warrants and subscription rights in one or more offerings. \nWe continue to monitor the financial markets, the stability of U.S. and international banks and general global economic conditions. In addition, our access to the capital markets and other financing sources is impacted by any change in our credit rating. If changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy or downgrade in our credit rating adversely affect our access to the capital markets and other financing sources, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing available capacity under our credit facilities to provide short-term funding. As of September 26, 2025, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.\nRefer to Note 4 of the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness.\nOverview of Cash Flows and Liquidity \nFollowing is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity ($ in millions): \n \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 26, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nTotal operating cash provided by continuing operations\n$\n691.5 \n$\n700.8 \nPurchases of property, plant and equipment\n$\n(74.7)\n$\n(63.5)\nProceeds from sale of property\n0.4 \n0.8 \nCash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received\n— \n(3.7)\nAll other investing activities\n10.8 \n(1.6)\nTotal investing cash used in continuing operations\n$\n(63.5)\n$\n(68.0)\nNet proceeds from (repayments of) commercial paper borrowings\n$\n105.8 \n$\n(571.2)\nRepurchase of common shares\n(1,345.1)\n(423.0)\nPayment of dividends \n(73.4)\n(83.9)\nProceeds from borrowings (maturities greater than 90 days), net of issuance costs\n— \n1,733.5 \nRepayment of borrowings (maturities greater than 90 days)\n(715.7)\n(1,000.0)\nProceeds from Ralliant Dividend\n1,150.0 \n— \nAll other financing activities\n15.6 \n47.9 \nTotal financing cash used in continuing operations\n$\n(862.8)\n$\n(296.7)\nOperating Activities\nOperating cash flows from continuing operations can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, interest, pension funding, and other items impact reported cash flows.\nOperating cash flows from continuing operations were $692 million during the year-to-date period, representing a decrease of $9 million when compared to the comparable period of 2024. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n•\nYear-over-year increase of $46 million in Operating cash flows from net earnings, net of non-cash items (Amortization, Depreciation, Stock-based compensation, and Loss from equity investments). \n•\nThe aggregate changes in accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable generated $12 million of cash during the year-to-date period as compared to generating $48 million in the comparable period of 2024. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle, which generally represents the number of \n35\nTable of Contents\ndays that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers, and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. \n•\nThe aggregate changes in prepaid expenses and other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $85 million of cash in the year-to-date period as compared to using $66 million of cash in the comparable period of 2024. The year-over-year changes were driven by timing differences related to contract assets, contract liabilities, and payments of income taxes and interest.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting cash outflows from continuing operations were $5 million less than the prior year. The current year had higher capital expenditures offset by cash inflows related to acquisitions and divestments.\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing production capacity, replacing aged equipment, supporting product development initiatives for hardware and software offerings, improving information technology systems, and purchasing equipment that is used in revenue arrangements with customers. \nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayment of debt and commercial paper, payments of cash dividends to shareholders and share repurchases. \nIn the year-to-date period, financing activities from continuing operations used cash of $863 million, reflecting the following transactions: \n•\nWe incurred $106 million in net commercial paper borrowings.\n•\nWe received a cash dividend of $1.15 billion from Ralliant in connection with the Separation (the “Ralliant Dividend”).\n•\nWe repurchased 25.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1,345 million, with $426 million from the Ralliant Dividend.\n•\nOn July 15, 2025, we used approximately $294 million of the Ralliant Dividend to redeem €252 million of the outstanding principal of the 3.7% Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2026.\n•\nOn July 24, 2025 and July 25, 2025, we used approximately $421 million of the Ralliant Dividend to repay the outstanding principal of the Euro Term Loan and Yen Term Loan.\n•\nWe made dividend payments to common shareholders totaling $73 million.\nIn the comparable 2024 period, financing activities from continuing operations used cash of $297 million, reflecting the following transaction:\n•\nWe repaid $571 million in net commercial paper borrowings.\n•\nOn January 2, 2024, we drew down $450 million of the Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2024.\n•\nOn February 13, 2024, we completed the sale of our registered offering of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, yielding net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. \n•\nOn February 13 2024, Fortive repaid $1.0 billion in outstanding principal of the Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2024, using net proceeds from the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes.\n•\nWe repurchased 5.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $423 million.\n•\nWe made dividend payments to common shareholders totaling $84 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThere were no material changes during the three and nine-month periods ended September 26, 2025 to the items we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n36\nTable of Contents"
