We have a vision to create transformative products and experiences that build meaningful connections, unlocking greater possibility and wellbeing for all. Since our inception, we have fostered a distinctive corporate culture; we promote a set of core values in our business which include taking personal responsibility, acting with courage, valuing connection and inclusion, and choosing to have fun. These core values attract passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals, and share our purpose \"to elevate human potential by helping people feel their best.\"\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2025, lululemon athletica inc. (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as \"lululemon,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our.\" We refer to the fiscal year ended February 2, 2025 as \"2024,\" the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 as \"2023.\" Our next fiscal year ends on February 1, 2026 and is referred to as \"2025.\"\nComponents of this discussion of our business include:\n•\nOur Products\n•\nOur Markets and Segments\n•\nIntegrated Marketing\n•\nProduct Design and Development\n•\nSourcing and Manufacturing\n•\nDistribution Facilities\n•\nCompetition\n•\nSeasonality\n•\nHuman Capital\n•\nIntellectual Property\n•\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Filings\nOur Products\nWe offer a comprehensive line of technical athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories marketed under the lululemon brand. Our apparel assortment includes items such as pants, shorts, tops, and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle including \n1\nTable\n of Contents\nathletic activities such as yoga, running, training, and most other activities. We also offer apparel designed for being on the move and fitness-inspired accessories. We expect to continue to broaden our merchandise offerings through expansion across these product areas. \nOur design and development team continues to source technically advanced fabrics, with new feel and fit, and craft innovative functional features for our products. Through our vertical retail strategy and direct connection with our customers, whom we refer to as guests, we are able to collect feedback and incorporate unique performance and fashion needs into our design process. In this way, we believe we are better positioned to address the needs of our guests, helping us advance our product lines and differentiate us from our competitors.\nDuring 2024, our women's range represented 63% of net revenue and our men's range represented 24% of net revenue. Our comprehensive men's line is a key pillar of our strategic growth plans. We believe net revenue from our men's range is growing as more guests discover the technical rigor and premium quality of our men's products, and are attracted by our distinctive brand. \nWe continue to innovate and introduce new products for our guests. This includes introducing new product categories and expanding our accessories assortment. We believe this is another way in which we can attract new guests and enable them to experience our products. Net revenue from our other product categories represented 13% of net revenue in 2024.\nOur Markets and Segments\nWe operate in over 25 countries around the world and organize our operations into four regional markets: Americas, China Mainland, Asia Pacific (\"APAC\"), and Europe and the Middle East (\"EMEA\"). \nWe report three segments, Americas, China Mainland, and Rest of World, which is comprised of the APAC and EMEA regions on a combined basis. \nWe operate an omni-channel retail model and aim to efficiently and effectively serve our guests in the ways most convenient to them. We continue to evolve and integrate our digital and physical channels in order to enrich our interactions with our guests, and to provide a seamless omni-channel experience. We have invested in technologies which enable our omni-channel retailing model. Our capabilities differ by market and include: \n•\nBuy online pick-up in store\n - guests can purchase our products via our website or digital app and then collect that product from a retail location; \n•\nBack-back room\n - our store educators can access inventory located at our other locations and have product shipped directly to a guest's address or a store;\n•\nShip from store\n – we are able to fulfill e-commerce orders by accessing inventory at both our distribution centers and at our retail locations, expanding the pool of accessible inventory;\n•\nReturns processing\n – e-commerce guests are able to return products either online or in-store; and\n•\nOne inventory pool\n – we are able to view and allocate the product held at our distribution centers to either our physical retail locations, or make it available to fulfill online demand.\n2\nTable\n of Contents\nWe operate a combination of physical retail locations and e-commerce services via our websites, other region-specific websites, digital marketplaces, and mobile apps. Our physical retail locations remain a key part of our growth strategy and we view them as a valuable tool in helping us build our brand and product line as well as enabling our omni-channel capabilities. We plan to continue to expand square footage and open new company-operated stores to support our growth objectives. \nAmericas\nWe have operated in the Americas for over 25 years. We opened our first ever store in Vancouver, Canada in 1998. In 2024, the net revenue we generated in the Americas represented 75% of our total net revenue. \n2024\n2023\n(In thousands)\nNet revenue\n$\n7,928,156 \n$\n7,631,647 \nNet revenue growth\n3.9 \n%\n11.9 \n%\nOur operations in the Americas are core to our business and we aim to continue to grow our net revenue in this market through ongoing product innovation and by building brand awareness. We also plan to continue to invest in our omni-channel capabilities, to open new retail locations, and to relocate, optimize, and renovate our existing locations as needed.\nWe generate net revenue in the Americas through our lululemon branded retail locations which include different sizes of company-operated stores, outlets, pop-ups, and other temporary locations. We also serve our guests via our e-commerce website www.lululemon.com, our mobile app, our “Like New” re-commerce program, and through certain wholesale arrangements including university campus retailers and other organizations that we partner with to sell co-branded lululemon products as well as through wholesale arrangements with yoga and fitness studios and other select partners. \nOn September 10, 2024, we acquired the lululemon branded retail locations and operations run by a third party in Mexico. We had previously granted the third party the right to operate retail locations and to sell lululemon products in Mexico. \nChina Mainland \nWe opened our first store in China Mainland in fiscal 2014. In 2024, the net revenue we generated in China Mainland represented 13% of our total net revenue. \n2024\n2023\n(In thousands)\nNet revenue\n$\n1,361,337 \n$\n963,760 \nNet revenue growth\n41.3 \n%\n67.2 \n%\nWe have experienced significant net revenue growth in China Mainland and believe that as we continue to expand our operations and build our brand awareness, net revenue will continue to increase in this market. We believe China Mainland net revenue growth will drive an increase in our overall international net revenue. We plan to continue to invest in China Mainland and expect that the majority of our company-operated store openings in 2025 will be in this market. \nWe operate lululemon branded retail locations in China Mainland in a variety of different formats including different sizes of company-operated stores, outlets, pop-ups, and other temporary locations. We also serve our guests via our WeChat store and on third party marketplaces such as T-Mall and JD.com. \n3\nTable\n of Contents\nRest of World \nIn 2024, the net revenue we generated in APAC and EMEA represented 12% of our total net revenue. \n2024\n2023\n(In thousands)\nNet revenue\n$\n1,298,633 \n$\n1,023,871 \nNet revenue growth\n26.8 \n%\n42.9 \n%\nWe have experienced significant net revenue growth in APAC and EMEA and intend to continue to invest in these markets to build brand awareness. Where we identify growth opportunities, we plan to open new retail locations, including in new markets across the EMEA and APAC regions. \nWe operate lululemon branded retail locations in these markets in a variety of different formats including different sizes of company-operated stores, outlets, pop-ups, and stores operated by third-parties under license and supply arrangements. We also serve our guests via our country specific websites, our mobile app, and through third party regional marketplaces, such as Zalando, Lazada, and SSG. \nOur Selling Channels \nWe conduct our business through a number of different channels in each market: \nCompany-operated stores\n: In addition to serving as a venue to sell our products, our stores give us a direct connection to our guests, which we view as a valuable tool in helping us build our brand and product lines as well as enabling our omni-channel capabilities. Our retail stores are located primarily on street locations, in lifestyle centers, and in malls. Our sales per square foot was $1,574 and $1,609 for 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNumber of company-operated stores by market\nFebruary 2, 2025\nJanuary 28, 2024\nUnited States\n374 \n367 \nCanada\n71 \n71 \nMexico\n17 \n— \nAmericas\n462 \n438 \nChina Mainland\n151 \n127 \nAustralia\n33 \n33 \nSouth Korea\n20 \n19 \nHong Kong SAR\n10 \n9 \nJapan\n10 \n8 \nNew Zealand\n8 \n8 \nTaiwan\n8 \n8 \nSingapore\n7 \n7 \nMalaysia\n5 \n3 \nThailand\n4 \n1 \nMacau SAR\n2 \n2 \nAPAC\n107 \n98 \n4\nTable\n of Contents\nNumber of company-operated stores by market\nFebruary 2, 2025\nJanuary 28, 2024\nUnited Kingdom\n19 \n20 \nGermany\n9 \n9 \nFrance\n6 \n6 \nIreland\n4 \n4 \nSpain\n3 \n3 \nNetherlands\n2 \n2 \nSweden\n2 \n2 \nNorway\n1 \n1 \nSwitzerland\n1 \n1 \nEMEA\n47 \n48 \nTotal company-operated stores\n767 \n711 \nE-commerce\n: We believe e-commerce is convenient for our guests and also allows us to reach and serve guests in markets beyond where our physical retail locations are based. We believe this channel is effective in building brand awareness, especially in new markets. We serve our guests via our e-commerce websites, other country and region-specific websites, digital marketplaces, and mobile apps. E-commerce net revenue includes our buy online pick-up in store, back-back room, and ship from store omni-channel retailing capabilities. \nOther channels\n: We also use certain other distribution channels, generally with the goal of building brand awareness and providing broader access to our products. These other channels include:\n•\nTemporary locations \n- Our seasonal stores and pop-ups are typically opened for a short period of time enabling us to serve guests during peak shopping periods in markets where we do not ordinarily have a physical location, or to expand access in markets where we see high demand at our existing locations. \n•\nWholesale\n - We sell to partners that offer convenient access for both core and new guests, including university campus retailers and other organizations that we partner with to sell co-branded lululemon products. We also sell to yoga and fitness studios and other select partners. \n•\nOutlets\n - We utilize outlets to sell slower moving inventory and inventory from prior seasons at discounted prices. As of February 2, 2025, we operated 52 outlets, the majority of which were in the Americas.\n•\nLike New\n - Our re-commerce program allows guests to exchange their gently used lululemon products for merchandise credit. Those products are then verified and quality checked before being resold online at likenew.lululemon.com. We believe this program is a step towards a circular eco-system and helps reduce our environmental footprint. \n•\nLicense and supply arrangements\n - We enter into license and supply arrangements when we believe it will be to our advantage to partner with third parties with significant experience and proven success in certain target markets. Under these arrangements we have granted certain third parties the right to operate lululemon branded retail locations and to sell lululemon products on websites in specific countries. On September 10, 2024, we acquired the lululemon branded retail locations and operations run by a third party in Mexico. We had previously granted the third party the right to operate retail locations and to sell lululemon products in Mexico.\n5\nTable\n of Contents\nNumber of retail locations operated by third parties by market\nFebruary 2, 2025\nJanuary 28, 2024\nMexico\n— \n15 \nUnited Arab Emirates\n10 \n8 \nSaudi Arabia\n8 \n6 \nIsrael\n7 \n3 \nKuwait\n4 \n3 \nQatar\n4 \n3 \nBahrain\n1 \n1 \nTotal locations operated by third parties under license and supply arrangements\n34 \n39 \nIntegrated Marketing\nWe believe that our brand awareness is relatively low, especially outside of the Americas, and also with men. This represents an opportunity for us and we have designed a multi-faceted strategy that leverages what guests know us for; our products, community, and experiences. This strategy is designed to leverage owned and paid channels, our ambassador network, events, and content – to drive awareness, consideration, engagement, conversion, and ultimately loyalty and engagement at the global, regional, and local levels. \nProduct Design and Development\nOur product design and development efforts are led by a team of researchers, scientists, engineers, and designers. Our team is comprised of athletes and users of our products who embody our design philosophy and dedication to premium quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our guests and our ambassadors, and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of function, style, and technical superiority.\nAs we strive to continue to provide our guests with technically advanced fabrics, our team works closely with our suppliers to incorporate the latest in technical innovation, bringing particular specifications to our products. We partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including pilling, shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and colorfastness. We develop proprietary fabrics and collaborate with leading fabric and trims suppliers to manufacture fabrics and trims that we generally seek to protect through agreements, trademarks, and as trade-secrets.\nSourcing and Manufacturing\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide fabrics for, and to produce, our products. The following statistics are based on cost.\nWe work with a group of approximately 52 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced 49% of our products in 2024, with the largest manufacturer producing 15%. During 2024, 40% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 11% in Indonesia, and 7% in Bangladesh, and the remainder in other regions.\nWe work with a group of approximately 67 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In 2024, 52% of our fabrics were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, with the largest manufacturer producing 18%. During 2024, 35% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, 28% from China Mainland, and 11% from South Korea, and the remainder from other regions. \nWe also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in APAC and China Mainland.\nWe have developed long-standing relationships with a number of our vendors and take care to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term contracts with the majority of our suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of our fabrics and garments, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, and production. Our product quality and sustainability teams closely assess and monitor each supplier's compliance with applicable laws and our Vendor Code of Ethics, including by partnering with leading inspection and verification firms.\n6\nTable\n of Contents\nDistribution Facilities\nWe operate and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. We own our distribution center in Groveport, Ohio, and lease our other distribution facilities. We also utilize third-party logistics providers in a number of countries in which we operate to warehouse and distribute finished products from their warehouse locations. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and consolidate or expand our distribution capacity as we believe appropriate for our operations and to meet anticipated needs.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the athletic apparel industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe we successfully compete on the basis of our premium brand image and our technical product innovation. We also believe our ability to introduce new product innovations, combine function and fashion, and connect through in-store, online, and community experiences sets us apart from our competition. In addition, we believe our vertical retail distribution strategy and community-based marketing differentiates us further, allowing us to more effectively control our brand image and connect with our guests.\nThe market for athletic apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. We are in direct competition with global as well as regional and country-specific wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel and footwear.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is typically weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season in the Americas, while our operating expenses are generally more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating profits are typically generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 42% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarter of 2024. \nHuman Capital\nOur Impact Agenda sets out our social and environmental goals and strategy across three pillars - Be Human, Be Well, and Be Planet. Details can be found in our Impact Report on our website. Included within our Impact Agenda is a goal to invest a total of $75.0 million to advance equity in well-being by the end of 2025. As of February 2, 2025, we have invested a total of $71.0 million\n(1)\n towards this goal. \nThe Be Human pillar of our Impact Agenda sets out our focus areas with respect to human capital, including inclusion for all, employee empowerment, and fair labor practices and the well-being of the people who make our products. \nInclusion for All\nWe are committed to fostering an environment where every individual feels valued and included, recognizing that diverse perspectives drive innovation and enrich our workplace.\nWe are proud that as of February 2, 2025, approximately 55% of our board of directors, 60% of our senior executive leadership team, and 45% of our vice presidents and above are women, while approximately 75% of our overall workforce are women. \nDuring 2024, we implemented an ongoing feedback approach to gain insights into our workforce composition and gather measurable data on employees' feelings of engagement, inclusion, and belonging. Our primary objective is to cultivate a workforce inspired and informed by the diversity of the communities we serve and where we operate. \nWe strive to maintain equitable pay, by geography, for comparable work across all our global operations. We have achieved full pay equity across various demographics in regions where we analyze this data.\nWe offer all employees education, training, and facilitated discussions on topics such as preventing bias, ensuring equal opportunity, and fostering inclusive leadership behaviors. We see strong engagement in inclusion-focused education and \n(1)\n We have contributed $71.0 million to lululemon's Centre for Social Impact, $45.5 million of which has been contributed directly to social impact organizations. The remaining $25.5 million primarily consists of contributions toward a donor-advised fund for future grant making.\n7\nTable\n of Contents\ntraining across our global employee base. We strive to foster a culture where inclusion is part of everyday conversations and regularly review our policies, programs, and practices to try to ensure they support a more inclusive and fair workplace.\nEmployee Empowerment\nWe believe our people are key to the success of our business. As of February 2, 2025, we employed approximately 39,000 people worldwide. We strive to foster a distinctive culture rooted in our core values that attracts and retains passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals. We believe our people succeed because we create an environment that fosters growth and provides opportunities for all.\nWe understand that health and wealth programs need to offer choice at all stages of life. Our current offerings support our goal of becoming the number one place where people come to develop and grow as inclusive leaders, and we regularly use feedback to inform opportunities to support this goal. These offerings include, among other things: \n•\nCompetitive compensation which rewards exceptional performance;\n•\nA Fund your Future program for eligible employees which offers partial contribution matches to a pension plan and employee share purchase plan;\n•\nAn annual paid VALUES (Volunteer, Awareness, Life, Unity, Empowerment, Support) Day, competitive paid time off, and sick leave;\n•\nAn employee discount program, which includes a lifetime discount to celebrate the contribution of our long-tenured employees to keep them within our collective, even when they have moved on to pursue goals outside of lululemon; \n•\nReimbursement programs which reward physical activity;\n•\nA parenthood program that provides all eligible employees up to six months of paid leave; \n•\nAn employee assistance program which provides free confidential support to all our employees and their families in a variety of areas from mental well-being to financial services to advice for new parents; and\n•\nTraining and development of all of our employees including, but not limited to, mentorship programs, global internships, leadership development, vision and goals, and coaching.\nFair Labor Practices and the Well-Being of the People who Make our Products \nWe work with suppliers who we believe share our values and collaborate with us to uphold robust standards, address systemic challenges, and support the well-being of people who make our products. Our Responsible Supply Chain program is built on three pillars:\n•\nMonitoring\n - Assessing and, in collaboration with suppliers, improving working conditions in facilities.\n•\nIntegration\n - Integrating responsible purchasing practices across key lululemon strategies, processes, and tools. \n•\nCollaboration\n - Working with multi-stakeholder organizations, industry, suppliers, and brands to support systemic change and impact. \n8\nTable\n of Contents\nOur Vendor Code of Ethics outlines our commitment to respect human and labor rights, and promote safe and fair working conditions for people in our supply chain. The code, which is based on international standards, sets the minimum standards for our supplier partners and is a component of our supplier and manufacturer agreements. Our finished goods and fabric suppliers are assessed against the Vendor Code of Ethics prior to forming a business relationship, and regularly thereafter; we work with factories that can uphold our strict requirements.\nOur Foreign Migrant Worker Standard sets out our minimum requirements for what we believe are the appropriate and ethical recruitment, employment, and repatriation of foreign migrant workers.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have trademark rights on many of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in building our brand image and in distinguishing our products from the products of others. We consider our lululemon and wave design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. In addition, we own many other trademarks for the names of several of our brands, slogans, fabrics and products. We own registered and pending U.S. and foreign utility and design patents, industrial designs in Canada, and registered community designs in Europe that protect our product innovations, distinctive apparel, and accessory designs.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Filings\nOur website address is www.lululemon.com. We provide free access to various reports that we file with, or furnish to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed or furnished.

Fiscal 2024 was a 53-week year. Net revenue includes results from the 53rd week; however, comparable sales exclude the 53rd week. Fiscal 2023 was a 52-week year.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe use comparable sales as a metric to evaluate the performance of our business. Refer to the Comparable Sales and Sales Per Square Foot\n \nsection of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information. \nWe provide constant dollar changes and adjusted financial results which exclude certain inventory provisions, asset impairments, and restructuring costs recognized in relation to lululemon Studio and their related tax effects. The constant dollar changes and adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures, and we provide them as supplemental information that enable evaluation of the underlying trend in our operating performance, and enable a comparison to our historical financial information. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for reconciliations between the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://corporate.lululemon.com/investors), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts. Information contained on or accessible through our websites is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this annual report or any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only. \nOverview\nFiscal 2024 was another year of growth for lululemon. Net revenue increased 10%, operating margin expanded 150 basis points, or 50 basis points on an adjusted basis, and diluted earnings per share grew 20%, or 15% on an adjusted basis. Our teams continued to execute against our Power of Three ×2 growth plan and the compound annual growth rate in net revenue was 19% between fiscal 2021 and 2024.\nWe saw growth across our regions, merchandise categories, and channels as we continue to engage with guests and provide them with innovative products that help enable their wellness journey. In the Americas, revenue grew 4% driven by strength in Canada. In the United States, we have been working to increase the level of seasonal newness within our assortment mix. In China Mainland, revenue increased 41%, and in Rest of World, revenue grew 27%. By category, we saw a 9% increase in women's, 14% growth in men's, and an 10% increase in other categories. We expanded our retail presence by adding 56 net new company-operated stores, contributing to a 14% increase in square footage. These metrics include our stores in Mexico which we now operate directly, the result of the acquisition of the Mexico operations from our license and \n26\nTable\n of Contents\nsupply partner in September 2024. Company-operated store net revenue increased 14% and e-commerce net revenue increased 6%.\nWe repurchased 5.1 million shares for $1.6 billion in 2024, and our board of directors approved increases in our stock repurchase authorization totaling $2.0 billion during 2024. \nBrand Campaigns and Activations\nDeepening our relationship with existing guests while also bringing new guests into the lululemon brand remains an important priority for us. We believe our unaided brand awareness is relatively low across most of the regions where we operate. In 2024, we brought several activations to life aimed at increasing loyalty with existing guests while, at the same time, attracting new guests into our brand.\nOur partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee was on full display during the Paris Olympics, as we outfitted the athletes for their off-field activities. In the Americas, we continued to grow our membership program and began offering new benefits including our Partner Perks program which provides members with exclusive experiences and perks from select partner brands. \nIn China Mainland, we expanded our Summer Sweat Games to over 70 stores across nearly 40 cities and for World Mental Health Day, we hosted activities in nine cities across China Mainland, anchored by our event along the West Bund in Shanghai. We also extended our World Mental Health Day activations to additional countries, including South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nIn 2024, we also welcomed additional new ambassadors to the brand, including six-time PGA tour winner Max Homa, Chinese director, actress, and screenwriter Jia Ling, and Frances Tiafoe our newest tennis ambassador.\nProduct Innovation\nWe continue to seek to create product that solves the unmet needs of our guests. We believe our technical product is a key competitive advantage for us, and our positioning as a premium athletic brand, with high style and high performance product, helps differentiate us from our peers.\nIn 2024, we remained focused on our core activities of yoga, run, and train and also our newer \"play\" activities including golf and tennis. In women's, Align, Define, and Scuba continued to be key product franchises for us, and towards the end of the year, we launched our Daydrift trouser; a refined, casual pant to be worn all day into night. For men, guests continued to respond to our lounge franchises including Steady State, Soft Jersey, and Smooth Spacer, and our performance franchises including Pacebreaker and Zeroed In. In footwear, we expanded our offering with new casual and performance styles including our first collection for men. And in accessories, we continued to bring innovation across our offering of bags, which drove good response from our guests.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe summary below compares 2024 to 2023 and provides both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The adjusted financial measures for 2023 exclude $72.1 million of post-tax asset impairment and other charges recognized in relation to lululemon Studio.

Such factors are expected to continue to impact our business throughout 2025, with the impact varying by market.\nConsumer confidence, purchasing behaviors, and their propensity to spend in our sector have been impacted by uncertain economic conditions including inflation, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors. We continue to monitor the economic environment, including in the US, Canada, and China Mainland. \nWe experienced revenue and traffic growth in 2024 compared to 2023 in all regions, but have experienced a reduction in our revenue growth rate in the Americas compared to the growth we had in previous years, driven by our operations in the United States. During 2024, Americas comparable sales decreased 1%. We are monitoring government policies in the Americas, including changes in tariffs, and while we do not expect current changes to have a material impact on the cost of our products, tariffs and related uncertainties could impact consumer confidence, traffic, and demand for our products.\nForeign currency fluctuations have adversely impacted our financial results. Foreign currency fluctuations reduced the growth of our net revenue by $75.3 million when comparing 2024 to 2023, primarily due to the overall appreciation of the US dollar. We expect future exchange rate volatility to impact our results.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated:\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n \n(In thousands)\n(Percentage of net revenue)\nNet revenue\n$\n10,588,126 \n$\n9,619,278 \n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of goods sold\n4,317,315 \n4,009,873 \n40.8 \n41.7 \nGross profit\n6,270,811 \n5,609,405 \n59.2 \n58.3 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n3,762,379 \n3,397,218 \n35.5 \n35.3 \nImpairment of goodwill and other assets, restructuring costs\n— \n74,501 \n— \n0.8 \nAmortization of intangible assets\n2,735 \n5,010 \n— \n0.1 \nIncome from operations\n2,505,697 \n2,132,676 \n23.7 \n22.2 \nOther income (expense), net\n70,380 \n43,059 \n0.7 \n0.4 \nIncome before income tax expense\n2,576,077 \n2,175,735 \n24.3 \n22.6 \nIncome tax expense\n761,461 \n625,545 \n7.2 \n6.5 \nNet income\n$\n1,814,616 \n$\n1,550,190 \n17.1 \n%\n16.1 \n%\n28\nTable\n of Contents\nComparison of 2024 to 2023 \nNet Revenue\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nYear over year change\n \n(In thousands)\n(Percentage of net revenue)\n(In thousands)\n(Percentage)\n(Constant dollar change)\nAmericas\n$\n7,928,156 \n$\n7,631,647 \n74.9 \n%\n79.3 \n%\n$\n296,509 \n4 \n%\n4 \n%\nChina Mainland\n1,361,337 \n963,760 \n12.9 \n10.0 \n397,577 \n41 \n43 \nRest of World\n1,298,633 \n1,023,871 \n12.3 \n10.6 \n274,762 \n27 \n29 \nNet revenue\n$\n10,588,126 \n$\n9,619,278 \n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n$\n968,848 \n10 \n%\n11 \n%\nThe increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased China Mainland net revenue.

It allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We believe investors would similarly find these metrics useful in assessing the performance of our business. \nComparable sales includes comparable company-operated store and all e-commerce net revenue. E-commerce net revenue includes buy online pick-up in store, back-back room, and ship from store net revenue in addition to our websites, \n33\nTable\n of Contents\nother region-specific websites, digital marketplaces, and mobile apps. Our back-back room capability allows our store educators to access inventory located at our other locations and have product shipped directly to a guest's address or a store. Comparable company-operated stores have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a company-operated store is included in comparable sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable sales excludes sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed, and sales from company-operated stores that have closed. Comparable sales also excludes sales from our selling channels other than company-operated stores and e-commerce. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCompany-operated stores acquired as a result of the acquisition of the Mexico operations will be considered comparable beginning October 2025, after 12 full fiscal months of sales from the date of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, wholesale sales were made to a third party under a license and supply arrangement.\nIn fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. \nSales Per Square Foot\nWe use sales per square foot to assess the performance of our company-operated stores relative to their square footage. We believe that sales per square foot is useful in evaluating the performance of our company-operated stores. Sales per square foot is calculated using total net revenue from all company-operated stores divided by the average ending square footage of the stores for each period during the year. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of sales per square foot. The square footage of our company-operated stores includes all retail related space, including selling space as well as storage and back-office areas. The sales per square foot metric we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant dollar changes and adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures. \nA constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in our results to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFor 2023, adjusted gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, income tax expense, effective tax rates, net income, and diluted earnings per share exclude certain inventory provisions, asset impairments, and restructuring costs recognized in relation to lululemon Studio, and the related income tax effects of these items. \nWe believe these adjusted financial measures are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information that enable evaluation of the underlying trend in our operating performance, and enable a comparison to our historical financial information. Further, due to the finite and discrete nature of these items, we do not consider them to be normal operating expenses that are necessary to run our business, or impairments that are expected to arise in the normal course of our operations. Management uses these adjusted financial measures and constant currency metrics internally when reviewing and assessing financial performance.\nThe presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n34\nTable\n of Contents\nConstant Dollar Changes\nThe below changes in net revenue and comparable sales show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily as a result of a decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $251.1 million, primarily driven by changes in accounts payable, inventories, accrued compensation, and other assets, partially offset by changes in income taxes and accrued liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was also a result of changes in impairment and other charges recognized in relation to lululemon Studio in 2023, and lower cash inflows related to derivatives, partially offset by increased deferred incomes taxes and depreciation. \nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of the lululemon branded retail locations and operations run by a third party in Mexico. Please refer to Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The increase in cash used in investing activities was also due to increased capital expenditures primarily due to an increase in supply chain infrastructure, company-operated stores expenditures, and system initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in corporate infrastructure capital expenditures. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the settlement of net investment hedges.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in our stock repurchases. During 2024, we repurchased 5.1 million shares at a total cost including commissions and excise taxes of $1.6 billion. During 2023, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total cost including commissions and excise taxes of $558.7 million. The common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.\nLiquidity Outlook\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of \n36\nTable\n of Contents\ndebt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nThe following table includes certain measures of our liquidity:\nFebruary 2, 2025\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,984,336 \nWorking capital\n(1)\n excluding cash and cash equivalents\n156,336 \nCapacity under committed revolving credit facility\n393,935 \n__________\n(1)\nWorking capital is calculated as current assets of $4.0 billion less current liabilities of $1.8 billion.\nCapital expenditures are expected to range between $740.0 million and $760.0 million in 2025.\nOur current commitments with respect to inventory purchases are included within our purchase obligations outlined below. The timing and cost of our inventory purchases will vary depending on a variety of factors such as revenue growth, assortment and purchasing decisions, product costs including freight and duty, and the availability of production capacity and speed. Our inventory balance as of February 2, 2025 was $1.4 billion, an increase of 9% from January 28, 2024. We expect that our inventories will continue to grow in 2025, and we expect the growth rate will exceed net revenue growth in 2025. \nOur existing Americas credit facility provides for $400.0 million in commitments under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. The credit facility has a maturity date of December 14, 2026. As of February 2, 2025, aside from letters of credit of $6.1 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Further information regarding our credit facilities and associated covenants is outlined in Note 12. Revolving Credit Facilities included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLeases.\n We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between two and 15 years, and generally can be extended in increments between two and five years, if at all. The following table details our future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance. \nPurchase obligations. \nThe amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets as of February 2, 2025.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements due by fiscal year as of February 2, 2025, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n \nTotal\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\n \n(In thousands)\nOperating leases (minimum rent)\n$\n1,845,624 \n$\n336,521 \n$\n314,027 \n$\n299,214 \n$\n243,199 \n$\n182,854 \n$\n469,809 \nPurchase obligations\n803,579 \n725,155 \n22,982 \n16,807 \n25,635 \n13,000 \n— \nAs of February 2, 2025, our minimum operating lease commitment for distribution center operating leases which have been committed to, but not yet commenced, was $274.8 million, which is not reflected in the table above.\nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of February 2, 2025, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $12.6 million had been issued, including $6.1 million under our committed revolving credit facility. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, \n37\nTable\n of Contents\nrequires the use of significant judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. \nOur critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are as follows, and see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of Part II for additional information:\nInventory provision\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a provision for obsolescence and goods that have quality issues or that are damaged. We record a provision at an amount that is equal to the difference between the inventory cost and its net realizable value. As of February 2, 2025, the net carrying value of our inventories was $1.4 billion, which included provisions for obsolete and damaged inventory of $82.3 million. The provision is determined based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions.\nDeferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries. \nWe have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future. \nFor the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be made as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and therefore would not be subject to Canadian withholding tax.\nAs of February 2, 2025, the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $3.7 billion, of which $1.6 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. The paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries was approximately $165.2 million.\nWe have recognized a deferred tax liability of $107.0 million as of February 2, 2025 which represents the Canadian withholding taxes payable on the portion of our Canadian earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested and cannot be repatriated as a return of capital, and U.S. state income taxes payable upon repatriation of the amounts which are not indefinitely reinvested.\nIn future periods, if the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries continues to grow, whether due to the accumulation of profits by these subsidiaries or due to a change in the amount that is indefinitely reinvested, we will record additional deferred tax liabilities, including both Canadian withholding taxes for the amount in excess of the paid-up capital balance and U.S. state income taxes.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities when a loss is assessed to be probable and its amount is reasonably estimable. If it is reasonably possible that a material loss could occur through ongoing litigation, we provide disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements. Assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Should we experience adverse court judgments or should negotiated outcomes differ to our expectations with respect to such ongoing litigation it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.",
