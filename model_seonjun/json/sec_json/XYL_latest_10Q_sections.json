We design, manufacture and service highly engineered products and solutions ranging across a wide variety of critical applications in utility, industrial, residential and commercial building services settings. Our broad portfolio of solutions addresses customer needs across the water cycle, from the delivery, measurement and use of drinking water to the collection, test, treatment and analysis of wastewater, to the return of water to the environment. Our product and service offerings are organized into four reportable segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide: Water Infrastructure, Applied Water, Measurement and Control Solutions and Water Solutions and Services.\n•\nWater Infrastructure\n serves the water infrastructure sector with transportation and treatment of water, offering a range of products including water, wastewater and storm water pumps, controls and systems; treatment equipment: filtration and separation, disinfection, wastewater solutions for municipal and industrial applications.\n•\nApplied Water\n serves the water usage applications sector with water pressure boosting systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and for fire protection systems to the residential and commercial building solutions markets. \n•\nMeasurement and Control Solutions\n primarily serves the utility infrastructure solutions and services sector by delivering communications, smart metering, measurement and control capabilities and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery, monitoring and control of critical resources such as water, electricity and natural gas. We also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure and analyze water quality, flow and level in clean water, wastewater and outdoor water environments. \n•\nWater Solutions and Services\n provides tailored services and solutions, in collaboration with customers, including on‑demand water, outsourced water, recycle/reuse, pipeline assessment services, specialty dewatering and emergency response service alternatives to improve operational reliability, performance and environmental compliance. \nExecutive Summary \nXylem reported revenue for the third quarter of 2025 of $2,268 million, an increase of 7.8% compared to $2,104 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. The revenue increase consisted primarily of organic growth of 6.9% across all of our segments, led by double digit organic growth in our Measurement and Control Solutions and Water Solutions and Services segments.\nAdditional financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 include the following:\n•\nOrders of $2,181 million, down 0.9% from $2,201 million in the prior year period, and down 2.0% on an organic basis.\n•\nEarnings per share of $0.93, up 4.5% compared to prior year ($1.37, up 23.4% versus prior year, on an adjusted basis).\n•\nNet income attributable to Xylem as a percent of revenue of 10.0%, down 30 basis points compared to 10.3% in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.2%, up 200 basis points when compared to 21.2% in the prior year.\n43\n \nKey Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or \"adjusted\") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures to be key performance indicators, as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n•\n\"organic revenue\" and \"organic orders\" defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures.  Divestitures include sales or discontinuance of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation.  The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.\n•\n\"constant currency\" defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.  This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar.\n•\n\"adjusted net income\" and \"adjusted earnings per share\" defined as net income attributable to Xylem and corresponding earnings per share, respectively, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain or loss from sale of businesses, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable.

Organic revenue increased $145 million, or 6.9%, and $332 million, or 5.3%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on revenue of $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and a favorable impact on revenue of $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by $7 million\n \nand\n \n$23 million due to acquisitions and divestitures, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. The increase in organic revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 is driven by strength in the U.S. and Canada mostly due to price realization and increased volume. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, organic growth is driven by price realization, increased volume, and backlog execution in the U.S. and Canada\n46\n \nThe following table illustrates the impact from organic growth, recent acquisitions and divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025:\n \nWater Infrastructure \nApplied Water\nMeasurement and Control Solutions\nWater Solutions and Services\nTotal Xylem\n(in millions)\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 Revenue\n$\n623 \n$\n447 \n$\n458 \n$\n576 \n$\n2,104 \nOrganic Growth\n34 \n5.5 \n%\n4 \n0.9 \n%\n50 \n10.9 \n%\n57 \n9.9 \n%\n145 \n6.9 \n%\nAcquisitions/(Divestitures)\n(15)\n(2.5)\n%\n— \n— \n%\n8 \n1.8 \n%\n— \n— \n%\n(7)\n(0.3)\n%\nConstant Currency\n19 \n3.0 \n%\n4 \n0.9 \n%\n58 \n12.7 \n%\n57 \n9.9 \n%\n138 \n6.6 \n%\nForeign currency translation (a)\n14 \n2.3 \n%\n5 \n1.1 \n%\n6 \n1.3 \n%\n1 \n0.2 \n%\n26 \n1.2 \n%\nTotal change in revenue\n33 \n5.3 \n%\n9 \n2.0 \n%\n64 \n14.0 \n%\n58 \n10.1 \n%\n164 \n7.8 \n%\n2025 Revenue\n$\n656\n \n$\n456\n \n$\n522\n \n$\n634\n \n$\n2,268\n \n(a)\nForeign currency translation impact for the year due to the strengthening in value of various currencies against the U.S. Dollar, the largest being the Euro, British Pound and the Swedish Krona.\n \nWater Infrastructure \nApplied Water\nMeasurement and Control Solutions\nWater Solutions and Services\nTotal Xylem\n(in millions)\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 Revenue\n$\n1,828 \n$\n1,339 \n$\n1,402 \n$\n1,737 \n$\n6,306 \nOrganic Growth\n88 \n4.8 \n%\n30 \n2.2 \n%\n123 \n8.8 \n%\n91 \n5.2 \n%\n332 \n5.3 \n%\nAcquisitions/(Divestitures)\n(44)\n(2.4)\n%\n— \n— \n%\n21 \n1.5 \n%\n— \n— \n%\n(23)\n(0.4)\n%\nConstant Currency\n44 \n2.4 \n%\n30 \n2.2 \n%\n144 \n10.3 \n%\n91 \n5.2 \n%\n309 \n4.9 \n%\nForeign currency translation (a)\n15 \n0.8 \n%\n5 \n0.4 \n%\n6 \n0.4 \n%\n(3)\n(0.1)\n%\n23 \n0.4 \n%\nTotal change in revenue\n59 \n3.2 \n%\n35 \n2.6 \n%\n150 \n10.7 \n%\n88 \n5.1 \n%\n332 \n5.3 \n%\n2025 Revenue\n$\n1,887\n \n$\n1,374\n \n$\n1,552\n \n$\n1,825\n \n$\n6,638\n \n(a)\nForeign currency translation impact for the year due to the strengthening in value of various currencies against the U.S. Dollar, the largest being the Euro and the British Pound, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian Dollar.\nWater Infrastructure \nWater Infrastructure revenue increased $33 million, or 5.3%, for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior year. Revenue growth for the quarter included organic revenue growth of $34 million, or 5.5%, and $14 million of favorable impacts from foreign currency translation partially offset by a loss of $15 million of revenue from net divestiture and acquisition activity. The transport applications contributed $19 million of organic revenue growth, driven by increased sales volume and price realization in the U.S. and timing of projects in western Europe, partially offset by reduced backlog execution due to softness in the emerging markets. Organic growth for the treatment application was $15 million, driven by backlog execution in the U.S., partially offset by timing of project revenue in western Europe and reduced volume due to softness in the emerging markets.  \n47\n \nWater Infrastructure revenue increased $59 million, or 3.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the prior year. Revenue growth included organic revenue growth of $88 million, or 4.8% and $15 million of favorable impacts from foreign currency translation partially offset by a loss of $44 million of revenue from net divestiture and acquisition activity. The treatment application contributed $46 million of organic revenue growth, led by strong backlog execution in the U.S. and the emerging markets. Organic growth for the transport application was $42 million, led by higher volume in the U.S., and strong backlog execution and order intake in western Europe. \nApplied Water\nApplied Water revenue increased $9 million, or 2.0%, for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior year. Revenue growth for the quarter included organic revenue growth of $4 million, or 0.9%, and $5 million of favorable\n \nforeign currency translation. Organic growth was driven by growth in the building solutions applications of $10 million, led by backlog execution and price realization in the U.S, partially offset by order softness in the emerging markets. These increases were partially offset by organic declines of $6 million in the industrial application, primarily due to order softness in the emerging markets.\nApplied Water revenue increased $35 million, or 2.6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the prior year. Revenue growth included organic revenue growth of $30 million, or 2.2%, and $5 million of favorable\n \nforeign currency translation.

Organic revenue growth was led by service growth of $52 million, primarily due to increased volume and price realization in the U.S. and increased volume in the emerging markets. Organic revenue from the capital and other applications increased by $39 million due to increased project revenue in the U.S. and increased volume in the emerging markets.\n48\n \nOrders / Backlog\nOrders\nAn order represents a legally enforceable, written document that includes the scope of work or services to be performed or equipment to be supplied to a customer, the corresponding price and the expected delivery date for the applicable products or services to be provided. An order often takes the form of a customer purchase order or a signed quote from a Xylem business. \nThe following tables illustrate the impact from organic decline/growth, recent acquisitions and divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to orders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025:\nWater Infrastructure\nApplied Water\nMeasurement and Control Solutions\nWater Solutions and Services\nTotal Xylem\n(in millions)\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 Orders\n$\n700\n \n$\n437\n \n$\n386\n \n$\n678\n \n$\n2,201\n \nOrganic Impact\n(15)\n(2.1)\n%\n2\n \n0.5 \n%\n42\n \n10.9 \n%\n(74)\n(10.9)\n%\n(45)\n(2.0)\n%\nAcquisitions/(Divestitures)\n(15)\n(2.1)\n%\n—\n \n— \n%\n13\n \n3.3 \n%\n—\n \n— \n%\n(2)\n(0.1)\n%\nConstant Currency\n(30)\n(4.2)\n%\n2\n \n0.5 \n%\n55\n \n14.2 \n%\n(74)\n(10.9)\n%\n(47)\n(2.1)\n%\nForeign currency translation (a)\n13\n \n1.8 \n%\n6\n \n1.3 \n%\n5\n \n1.3 \n%\n3\n \n0.4 \n%\n27\n \n1.2 \n%\nTotal change in orders\n(17)\n(2.4)\n%\n8\n \n1.8 \n%\n60\n \n15.5 \n%\n(71)\n(10.5)\n%\n(20)\n(0.9)\n%\n2025 Orders\n$\n683\n \n$\n445\n \n$\n446\n \n$\n607\n \n$\n2,181\n \n(a)\nForeign currency translation impact for the year due to the strengthening in value of various currencies against the U.S. Dollar, the largest being the Euro, British Pound and the Swedish Krona.\nWater Infrastructure\nApplied Water\nMeasurement and Control Solutions\nWater Solutions and Services\nTotal Xylem\n(in millions)\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\n2024 Orders\n$\n2,036\n \n$\n1,382\n \n$\n1,199\n \n$\n1,917\n \n$\n6,534\n \nOrganic Impact\n(23)\n(1.1)\n%\n32\n \n2.3 \n%\n54\n \n4.5 \n%\n(84)\n(4.4)\n%\n(21)\n(0.3)\n%\nAcquisitions/(Divestitures)\n(45)\n(2.2)\n%\n—\n \n— \n%\n25\n \n2.1 \n%\n—\n \n— \n%\n(20)\n(0.3)\n%\nConstant Currency\n(68)\n(3.3)\n%\n32\n \n2.3 \n%\n79\n \n6.6 \n%\n(84)\n(4.4)\n%\n(41)\n(0.6)\n%\nForeign currency translation (a)\n13\n \n0.6 \n%\n5\n \n0.4 \n%\n7\n \n0.6 \n%\n(5)\n(0.2)\n%\n20\n \n0.3 \n%\nTotal change in orders\n(55)\n(2.7)\n%\n37\n \n2.7 \n%\n86\n \n7.2 \n%\n(89)\n(4.6)\n%\n(21)\n(0.3)\n%\n2025 Orders\n$\n1,981\n \n$\n1,419\n \n$\n1,285\n \n$\n1,828\n \n$\n6,513\n \n(a)\nForeign currency translation impact for the year due to the strengthening in value of various currencies against the U.S. Dollar, the largest being the Euro and the British Pound, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian Dollar.\n49\n \nBacklog\nBacklog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period. Delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. Annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. As such, beginning total backlog, plus orders, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Typically, capital projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays occur from time to time. Total backlog was $4,819 million at September 30, 2025, a decrease of $434 million, or 8.3%, as compared to September 30, 2024 backlog of $5,253 million. The decrease in backlog was driven by increased revenue outpacing order intake and contract wins in the current period, partially offset by favorable impacts from foreign currency translation. The backlog decrease was led by the Measurement and Control Solutions and Water Solutions and Services segments due to strong backlog execution and improved lead times. These backlog declines were partially offset by backlog growth in the Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments primarily due to orders and contract wins outpacing revenue, and favorable foreign currency impacts. Backlog decreased $251 million, or 5.0%, at September 30, 2025, as compared to December 31, 2024 backlog of $5,070 million. We anticipate that approximately 30% of the backlog as of September 30, 2025 will be recognized as revenue in the remainder of 2025. There were no significant order cancellations during the quarter.\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 160 basis points t\no\n 38.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 37.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The gross margin increase was partially offset by unfavorable impacts of 20 basis points from increases in acquired intangible amortization and restructuring and realignment costs as compared to the prior year. Gross margin expansion was driven by 430 basis points of favorable operational impacts, led by 230 basis points of productivity savings and 140 basis points of price realization. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by 250 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts driven by 200 basis points of inflation and 40 basis points of unfavorable mix. \nGross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points to 38.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 37.3% for the nine months ended \nSeptember 30,\n 2024. The gross margin increase included favorable impacts of 20 basis points from decreases in acquired intangible amortization and special charges, partially offset by increased restructuring and realignment charges as compared to the prior year. Gross margin expansion included favorable operational impacts of 360 basis points, driven almost entirely by 220 basis points of productivity savings and 130 basis points of price realization. These increases in gross margin were offset by 280 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts driven by 190 basis points of inflation and 70 basis points of unfavorable mix. \n50\n \nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n474\n \n$\n445 \n6.5 \n%\n$\n1,437\n \n$\n1,404 \n2.4 \n% \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n20.9\n \n%\n21.2 \n%\n(30)\nbp \n21.6\n \n%\n22.3 \n%\n(70)\nbp \nResearch and development expenses\n52\n \n55 \n(5.5)\n% \n166\n \n172 \n(3.5)\n% \nR&D as a % of revenue\n2.3\n \n%\n2.6 \n%\n(30)\nbp \n2.5\n \n%\n2.7 \n%\n(20)\nbp \nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\n23\n \n4 \n475.0 \n%\n70\n \n37 \n89.2 \n% \nOperating expenses\n$\n549\n \n$\n504 \n8.9 \n% \n$\n1,673\n \n$\n1,613 \n3.7 \n% \nExpense to revenue ratio\n24.2\n \n%\n24.0 \n%\n20 \nbp \n25.2\n \n%\n25.6 \n%\n(40)\nbp \nSelling, General and Administrative (\"SG&A\") Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased by $29 million to $474 million, or 20.9% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2025, as compared to $445 million, or 21.2% of revenue, in the comparable 2024 period, and increased $33 million to $1,437 million, or 21.6% of revenue, in the nine month period ended September 30, 2025. The increase in SG&A in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior year was driven by $15 million of increased spending on strategic investments and $13 million of inflation. The increase in SG&A in the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by $42 million of inflation with increased spending on strategic initiatives being more than offset by productivity savings.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\") Expenses\nR&D expense was $52 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2025, as compared to $55 million, or 2.6% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024, and was $166 million, or 2.5% of revenue, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $172 million, or 2.7% of revenue, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. R&D expense was fairly consistent year over year and in line with planned spending in this area. \nRestructuring and Asset Impairment Charges \nRestructuring \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we incurred restructuring charges of $23 million and $62 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred restructuring charges of $4 million and $36 million, respectively, For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the incurred charges primarily related to actions taken to further streamline our organization through simplification efforts in order to strengthen our competitive positioning and ability to better serve our customers.\nActions commenced in 2025 and 2024 consist primarily of severance charges. We currently expect to incur between $90 and $100 million in restructuring costs for the full year. \nRefer to Note 5, \"Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges\" for more information.\n51\n \nThe following is a roll-forward for the \nnine months ended\n September 30, 2025 and 2024 of employee position eliminations associated with restructuring activities: \n2025\n2024\nPlanned reductions - January 1\n382\n \n113 \nAdditional planned reductions\n858\n \n276 \nActual reductions and reversals\n(711)\n(190)\nPlanned reductions - September 30\n529\n \n199 \nAsset Impairment\nRefer to Note 9, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for more information on intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2025. \nOperating Income, Net Income, and Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating income was $334 million (operating margin of 14.7%) during the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $54 million, or 19.3%, when compared to operating income of $280 million (operating margin of 13.3%) during the prior year. Operating margin increased 140 basis points. Operating margin expansion was partially offset by 90 basis points of unfavorable impacts from increased restructuring and realignment costs, acquired intangible amortization, and special charges relative to the prior year period. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 560 basis points of favorable operational impacts driven by 320 basis points of productivity savings and 190 basis points of price realization. These favorable impacts were partially offset by 330 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts, driven by 230 basis points of inflation, 40 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments, and 40 basis points of unfavorable mix. Excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and realignment costs, and special charges, adjusted operating income was $429 million (adjusted operating margin of 18.9%) for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $350 million (adjusted operating margin of 16.6%) during the comparable quarter in the prior year. \nNet income attributable to Xylem for the third quarter was $227 million (net income margin of 10.0%), an increase of $10 million as compared to net income attributable to Xylem in the prior year of $217 million (net income margin of 10.3%). The increase in net income attributable to Xylem was driven by increased operating income of $54 million, increased non-operating income of $5 million, decreased interest expense of $4 million, and the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of $1 million, partially offset by increased loss from sale of businesses of $35 million and increased income tax expense of $19 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $527 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.2%) during the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $80 million, or 18.0%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $447 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.2%) during the comparable quarter in the prior year, an increase to adjusted EBITDA margin of 200 basis points. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by the same factors impacting the adjusted operating margin increase.\nOperating income was $870 million (operating margin of 13.1%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $128 million, or 17.3%, when compared to operating income of $742 million (operating margin of 11.8%) during the prior year. Operating margin increased 130 basis points, which included net unfavorable impacts of 30 basis points from increased restructuring and realignment costs and acquired intangible amortization, slightly offset by decreased special charges compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 560 basis points of favorable operational impacts driven by 350 basis points of productivity savings and 170 basis points of price realization. These favorable impacts were partially offset by 400 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts, driven by 240 basis points of inflation, 70 basis points of unfavorable mix, and 40 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments. Excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and realignment costs, and special charges, adjusted operating income was $1,156 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.4%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $996 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.8%) during the comparable period in the prior year. \n52\n \nNet income attributable to Xylem for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $622 million (net income margin of 9.4%), an increase of $58 million as compared to net income attributable to Xylem in the prior year of $564 million (net income margin of 8.9%). The increase in net income attributable to Xylem was driven by increased operating income of $128 million, decreased interest expense of $12 million, increased non-operating income of $2 million, and the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of $5 million offset by increased loss from sale of businesses of $41 million, and increased income tax expense of $48 million. \nAdjusted EBITDA was $1,452 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.9%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $162 million, or 12.6%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1,290 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%) during the comparable prior year period, an increase in adjusted EBITDA margin of 140 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin was impacted by the same offsetting factors impacting the adjusted operating margin.\n53\n \nThe table below provides a reconciliation of the total and each segment's operating

(operating margin of 17.2%) during the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $17 million, or 17.7%, when compared to operating income of $96 million (operating margin of 15.4%) during the prior year, or a total increase in operating margin of 180 basis points. Operating margin expansion was partially offset by net unfavorable impacts of 250 basis points from increased restructuring and realignment costs and special charges, partially offset by decreased acquired intangible asset amortization as compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 850 basis points of favorable operating impacts driven by 430 basis points of productivity and restructuring savings, 260 basis points of price realization, and 70 basis points of favorable mix. Margin expansion was partially offset by 420 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts, driven by 200 basis points of inflation, 120 basis points of decreased volume, and 50 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring and realignment costs and special charges, adjusted operating income was $145 million (adjusted operating margin of 22.1%) for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $111 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.8%) for the third quarter of 2024. \nAdjusted EBITDA was $160 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.4%) for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $33 million, or 26.0%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $127 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.4%) during the prior year.

Operating margin growth included unfavorable impacts of 80 basis points from increases in restructuring and realignment costs partially offset by declines in acquired intangible amortization compared to the prior year. Operating margin expansion included 740 basis points of favorable operational impacts, driven by 420 basis points of productivity and restructuring savings and 210 basis points of price realization. Margin expansion was partially offset by 370 basis points of unfavorable operating impacts driven by 230 basis points of inflation, 40 basis points of decreased volume and 30 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring and realignment costs, and special charges, adjusted operating income was $379 million (adjusted operating margin of 20.1%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $300 million (adjusted operating margin of 16.4%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \nAdjusted EBITDA was $422 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.4%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $68 million, or 19.2%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $354 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.4%) during the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was impacted by the same offsetting factors impacting the adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from the relative impact of decreased depreciation and software amortization.\nApplied Water \nOperating income for our Applied Water segment was $85 million (operating margin of 18.6%) during the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $14 million, or 19.7%, when compared to operating income of $71 million (operating margin of 15.9%) during the prior year, or a total increase in operating margin of 270 basis points. Operating margin expansion was negatively impacted by 50 basis points from increases in restructuring and realignment costs as compared to the prior year. Operating margin expansion included 750 basis points of favorable operational impacts, driven by 550 basis points of productivity savings, 90 basis points of favorable mix, and 70 basis points of price realization. Operating margin expansion was offset by 430 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts driven primarily by 270 basis points of inflation, 60 basis points of inventory management costs, 50 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments, and 50 basis points of decreased volume. Excluding restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $89 million (adjusted operating margin of 19.5%) for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $73 million (adjusted operating margin of 16.3%) for the third quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $99 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%) for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $16 million, or 19%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $83 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.6%) during the prior year.

Excluding restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $260 million (adjusted operating margin of 18.9%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $209 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.6%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $289 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.0%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $54 million, or 23.0%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $235 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6%) during the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin.\n59\n \nMeasurement and Control Solutions\nOperating income for our Measurement and Control Solutions segment was $64 million (operating margin of 12.3%) during the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $2 million, or 3.0%, when compared to operating income of $66 million (operating margin of 14.4%) during the prior year, or a total decrease in operating margin of 210 basis points. The operating margin decline included unfavorable impacts of 140 basis points from an increase in acquired intangible asset amortization, special charges, and restructuring and realignment costs as compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin declines included 640 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts, primarily consisting of 290 basis points of unfavorable mix, 240 basis points of inflation, 70 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments, and 70 basis points of inventory management costs. The decline in margin was partially offset by positive operational impacts of 570 basis points consisting of 340 basis points of productivity savings, 150 basis points of price realization, and 80 basis points of increased volume. Excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and realignment costs and special charges, adjusted operating income was $90 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.2%) for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $82 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.9%) for the third quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $114 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.8%) for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $17 million, or 18%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $97 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.2%) during the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was due to the same factors as those impacting the decrease in adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA benefitted from decreased non-operating expenses and was not negatively impacted by the relative impact of increases in depreciation and software amortization expense.\nOperating income for our Measurement and Control Solutions segment was $188 million (operating margin of 12.1%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $27 million, or 12.6%, when compared to operating income of $215 million (operating margin of 15.3%) during the prior year, or a total decrease in operating margin of 320 basis points.

Excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and realignment costs, and special charges, adjusted operating income was $127 million (adjusted operating margin of 20.0%) for the third quarter of 2025 as \n60\n \ncompared to adjusted operating income of $94 million (adjusted operating margin of 16.3%) for the third quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $167 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3%) for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $25 million, or 18%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $142 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7%) during the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors as those impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from the relative impact of decrease in depreciation and software amortization.\nOperating income for our Water Solutions and Services segment was $220 million (operating margin of 12.1%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $60 million, or 37.5%, when compared to operating income of $160 million (operating margin of 9.2%) during the prior year, or a total increase in operating margin of 290 basis points. Operating margin expansion included net favorable impacts of 180 basis points due to decreases in restructuring and realignment costs and special charges, partially offset by increases in acquired intangible asset amortization as compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 440 basis points of favorable operational impacts, driven by 210 basis points of price realization, 120 basis points of productivity savings, and 40 basis points of increased volume.

Adjusted EBITDA margin increased due to the same factors as those impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from the impact of essentially flat depreciation and software amortization expense relative to increased revenue.\nCorporate and Other \nOperating loss for corporate and other increased $10 million, or 62.5%, during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year period. Operating loss increased primarily due to increased spending on and timing of strategic investments and inflation. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating loss for corporate and other increased $12 million, or 120.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, driven by the same factors as those driving the increase in operating loss.\nOperating loss for corporate and other increased $5 million, or 7.1%, during nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period. The increased operating loss was primarily due to increased spending on strategic investments and inflation, partially offset by lower special charges. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating loss for corporate and other increased $11 million, or 20.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nInterest Expense \nInterest expense was $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $10 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by increased interest income generated on cross currency swaps offsetting interest expense.\nInterest expense was $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by increased interest income generated on cross currency swaps offsetting interest expense, and lower debt due to the repayment of the term loan entered into in May 2023 for use in funding the acquisition of Evoqua, which was repaid on April 19, 2024.\nSee Note 10, “Derivative Financial Instruments” and Note 12, \"Credit Facilities and Debt,\" of our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of our net investment hedges and credit facilities and long-term debt, respectively. \n61\n \nIncome Tax Expense \nThe income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $71 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.9%, compared to $52 million of expense resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.3% for the same period in 2024. The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $196 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.1%, compared to $148 million of expense resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.7% for the same period in 2024. The effective tax rate for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2025 was higher than the effective tax rate for the same period in 2024, primarily due to the mix of earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recognized in the prior period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nThe following table summarizes our sources and (uses) of cash:\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\nOperating activities\n$\n698\n \n$\n688 \n$\n10 \nInvesting activities\n(329)\n(193)\n(136)\nFinancing activities\n(382)\n(520)\n138 \nForeign exchange (a)\n83\n \n(5)\n88 \nIncrease in cash classified within assets held for sale\n11\n \n— \n11 \nDecrease in cash classified within assets held for sale\n(11)\n— \n(11)\nTotal\n$\n70\n \n$\n(30)\n$\n100 \n(a)\nThe impact is primarily due to strengthening of the Euro and the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity \nOperating Activities \nCash generated by operating activities was $698 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to cash generated by operating activities of $688 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in cash provided was primarily driven by higher cash earnings, and reduced investment in working capital, reflecting inventory management initiatives. The recognition of receivables on long term contracts, increased payments for infrastructure costs and higher tax payments, partially offset these items.\nInvesting Activities \nCash used in investing activities was $329 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $193 million used in the comparable prior year period. The increase in cash used primarily reflects cash paid for an acquisitions, including an asset acquisition, higher capital expenditures and increased cash paid for investments. Increased proceeds from the sale of businesses, including the sale of the former Evoqua Magneto business, and cash received from the sale of property plant and equipment partially offset these items.  \n \nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $382 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to cash used of $520 million in the comparable prior year period. The decrease in cash used reflects the repayment of a term loan in 2024, partially offset by lower proceeds from employee stock option exercises, increased repayments of equipment financing debt, and higher dividend payments.\nFunding and Liquidity Strategy \nOur ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets. We continually evaluate aspects of our spending, including capital expenditures, strategic investments and dividends.\n62\n \nIf our cash flows from operations are less than we expect, we may need to incur debt or issue equity. From time to time, we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, and (iii) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all. Our securities are rated investment grade. A significant change in credit rating could impact our ability to borrow at favorable rates. Refer to Note 12, \"Credit Facilities and Debt\", of our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of limitations on obtaining additional funding. \nWe monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost-effective basis. In addition, our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required. \nBased on our current global cash positions, cash flows from operations and access to the capital markets, we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements and service debt and other obligations in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. during the year. Currently, we have available liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion of cash and $1 billion of available credit facilities as disclosed in Note 12, \"Credit Facilities and Debt\", of our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCredit Facilities & Long-Term Contractual Commitments\nSee Note 12, \"Credit Facilities and Debt,\" of our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt. \nNon-U.S. Operations\nAs we continue to grow our operations outside of the U.S., we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from non-U.S. operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be held by our foreign subsidiaries. We expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. We may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the U.S. and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost-effective to do so. We continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile, expected future cash generation and investment opportunities, and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our U.S. operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and capital resources are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the condensed consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2024 Annual Report describes the critical accounting estimates used in preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates. There have been no significant changes in the information concerning our critical accounting estimates as stated in our 2024 Annual Report. \n2025 Outlook \nWe are raising our total revenue growth outlook to 5% to 6%, and organic revenue growth to 4% to 5% in 2025. Our outlook is being provided in the context of the current volatility, including due to geopolitical, trade, macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty. Our ability to meet our expectations is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in our 2024 Annual Report. \n63"
