  "item1": "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nRepublic is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue. We operate across the United States and Canada through 367 collection operations, 248 transfer stations, 75 recycling centers, 208 active landfills, 2 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 23 treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF), 5 salt water disposal wells, 14 deep injection wells, and 1 polymer center. We are engaged in 79 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 125 closed landfills. \nWe believe the total addressable North American environmental services market in which we operate generates approximately $165 billion of annual revenue, which includes the $105 billion United States and Canada recycling and waste industry, $35 billion of the broader environmental solutions industry, and $25 billion in sustainability innovation (described below) and emerging waste and recycling technologies. Within our recycling and waste business, we prioritize investments in market verticals with above average growth rates and higher return profiles. Environmental solutions remains fragmented, which provides consolidation opportunities to drive scale. We believe customer demand for products and services that respond to evolving environmental trends, including decarbonization and circularity, should support above average growth rates and attractive returns in our sustainability innovation businesses. We believe we can further expand our addressable market into other segments of the environmental services industry over time by leveraging our differentiated capabilities, including (1) customer zeal, (2) digital and (3) sustainability.\nWe operate throughout North America, but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of material is very much a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of the markets we serve. By combining local operating management with standardized business practices, we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the Company while maintaining day-to-day operating decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.\nOur purpose-driven vision is to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world. We believe that our products and services are valuable to our customers and essential for long-term sustainability. \nWe further believe our focus on and commitment to sustainability allows us to attract and retain the best talent, win more customers, increase customer loyalty and, ultimately, drive higher revenue and profits. \nFoundational Elements\nOur strategy is designed to generate profitable growth by sustainably managing our customers’ needs, and it is underpinned by three foundational elements – (1) our market position, (2) our operating model and (3) our people and talent agenda.\nMarket Position\nOur goal is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns. We strive to have a leading market position in each of the markets we serve, or have a clear path toward how we will achieve a leading market position over time. In situations where we cannot establish a leading market position, or where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets. \nWe have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and public-private partnerships. Additionally, our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge, including the effects of legislation, demographic shifts and changes in the market and the competitive landscape. \nInternal Growth\n•\nVolume Growth\n - \nWe believe volumes are driven by population growth, household formation and new business formation. Volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business. We seek to obtain long-term contracts for collecting recyclable, solid waste and industrial waste material under residential collection contracts with municipalities, exclusive franchise agreements, small-container and large-container contracts and environmental solutions service contracts. We also look to enter into long-term disposal and recycling contracts with municipalities and other third parties. By obtaining such long-term agreements, we can grow our contracted revenue base at a rate consistent with the underlying economic growth in \n2\nTable of Contents\nthese markets. In addition, by securing long-term agreements, we are better able to help ensure we earn an appropriate return on the capital deployed.\n•\nPrice Increases\n - \nWe seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs, improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in vehicles, equipment, recycling centers, transfer stations, TSDFs, deep well injection facilities, landfills, and other post-collection infrastructure. \n•\nExpansion of Recycling Capabilities\n \n-\n \nBased on the most recent United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, approximately 32% of municipal solid waste is recycled and/or composted. We expect that percentage to increase over the long-term as communities enhance and expand their recycling programs for their residents. As a key player in the circular economy, we are strategically focused on expanding recycling volume through innovative material handling processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices while also generating an appropriate return. In 2024, we commenced operation at our first Polymer Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, and completed construction at our Polymer Center in Indianapolis, Indiana. Our Polymer Centers are part of a vertical integration that will advance circularity for plastics and help us manage the plastics stream from curbside collection to delivery of recycled content for consumer packaging. Our Polymer Centers will enable us to produce food-grade drop-in substitutes for virgin plastics, while allowing us to expand recycling of plastics across North America. In 2023, we announced the development of Blue Polymers, a joint-venture with Ravago JV Holdings, LLC, creating vertical integration that will further advance circularity by acquiring all olefins produced by the Polymer Centers to further process and manufacture custom blended pellets for food-grade and non-food-grade packaging. Blue Polymers production facilities are currently being constructed in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Buckeye, Arizona. We will continue to look for opportunities to expand or enhance our recycling capabilities in markets where customers are demanding these services, demonstrating a willingness to pay and where we can earn an appropriate return on our investment. \n•\nInfrastructure Development - We seek to identify opportunities to further our position as a vertically integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated. Our goal is to create market-specific, vertically integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations, recycling centers, transfer stations, TSDFs, deep well injection facilities, and landfills. Where appropriate, we seek to obtain permits to build recycling centers, transfer stations, TSDFs, deep well injection facilities, and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites. Additionally, we seek opportunities to expand and permit new airspace at our existing landfills in order to replace airspace consumed. Development projects, while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions, typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success. We undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available. Through landfill and fleet innovation, recycling and circularity of key materials and renewable energy production, we are committed to continuous development of environmentally responsible operations that increase our efficiency as well as our ability to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.\nExternal Growth - Acquisitions and Public-Private Partnerships\n•\nOur acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held environmental services businesses that complement our existing business platform. We believe our ability to successfully complete these acquisitions is enhanced by the challenges facing many privately-held companies, including increasing competition in the environmental services industry, increasing capital requirements due to changes in regulatory requirements and technology and the limited number of exit strategies for privately-held companies. We also evaluate stand-alone opportunities to acquire businesses and/or facilities that are being divested by other publicly-owned companies. \nWe continue to invest in value-enhancing acquisitions in existing markets. Given our free cash flow, availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets, we have the financial flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform, including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves. \nWe also focus on growth through public-private partnerships, which include the recycling and waste operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments. We believe over time we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they seek to raise capital and/or reduce risk.\nWe realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations, whether through acquisitions or public-private partnerships, which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing, personnel, fleet maintenance, inventories and back-office administration.\n3\nTable of Contents\nOperating Model\nOur operating model allows us to deliver a consistent, high-quality service to all our customers through the Republic Way: \nOne Way. Everywhere. Every Day\n. This approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence. The Republic Way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business. Key elements of our operating model are our organizational structure, safety, fleet automation, fleet electrification and standardized maintenance.\nOrganizational Structure\nA key enabler of the Republic Way operating model is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360-degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management, supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise. This structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets, while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics.\nThrough this operating model, we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in an efficient and environmentally sound way.\nOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through three field groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States, the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating in geographic areas located across the United States and Canada. These groups each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal.\nSafety\n \nRepublic is dedicated to the safety of our employees, customers and the communities we serve. We have a dedicated team of safety professionals at our corporate headquarters and in our field operations, led by our Vice President of Environmental Health and Safety who reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. Due to the nature of our industry, we make safety a top priority and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records. Over the past 10 years, our safety performance (based on OSHA recordable rates) has been 24% better than the industry average. Our \nThink, Choose, Live\n slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to: \nThink\n about what you are doing, \nChoose\n the safe answer and \nLive\n to go home to your family. With the phrase printed on numerous items, including hard hats and the equipment our employees use, there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition in which they came to work. Our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night.\nThrough our Safety Amplified program, we are providing more tools and driving greater awareness to help our teams better execute our safety standards. Regular training, multifaceted programs and strategic partnerships are key components to this program. It is simple by design and comprised of actions and activities that ensure safety is embedded in all we do. The program includes six initiatives to help us achieve our goal to have zero employee fatalities and reduce our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate.\n•\nFocus Together: This effort is the very core of our safety program and is designed to help frontline employees eliminate the six most common types of serious incidents.\n•\nLead Together: We provide best-in-class communication channels and advanced training techniques for all frontline supervisors and managers to help them guide their teams.\n•\nPartner Together: Staying safe requires involvement by employees at all levels. We’ve increased leadership visits with frontline employees and supervisors to support each divisions’ safety goals.\n•\nCelebrate Together: We take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety. Employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award, the National Waste & Recycling Association’s Driver of the Year. Republic drivers have won 69% of the Driver of the Year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009. In addition, our best drivers are recognized and rewarded with competing in our National Road-EO competition.\n•\nAnalyze Together: We analyze real-time data to make short- and long-term decisions and identify opportunities for improvement. Examples include analysis of roadway awareness training, data mapping and other employee protection and preparedness insights. \n•\nInnovate Together: We employ the latest technologies in our fleet, including automation, rear cameras, in-cab backup alarms and event recording systems, and we take a data-driven approach to support our employees. We also work with \n4\nTable of Contents\nequipment manufacturers to incorporate safety elements such as seat belt alarms, blind spot awareness, lane departure alarms and other potentially lifesaving equipment in our fleet.\nWe believe our Safety Amplified program provides additional benefits for our Company and stakeholders including:\n•\nfurther strengthening relationships within the communities we service;\n•\nenhancing customer trust;\n•\nstreamlining operational processes and increasing productivity;\n•\ndelivering a reputational advantage, including positioning our Company as an employer-of-choice;\n•\nbuilding and sustaining a safety culture in all areas of our business; and\n•\ncontributing to employee engagement.\nFor more information regarding our safety performance, refer to our Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) report, which can be found at republicservices.com/sustainability. The information contained on our website shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other filing we make under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).\nFleet Automation\nApproximately 77% of our residential routes have been converted to automated single-driver trucks. By converting our residential routes to automated service, we reduce labor costs, improve driver productivity, decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees. Additionally, communities using automated vehicles generally have higher participation rates in recycling programs, thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities.\nFleet Electrification\nWe believe we are taking a leadership position in electric technology innovation for our recycling and waste collection fleet. This is a critical step toward reducing our environmental impact through lower fleet emissions. We believe it will also improve our total cost of ownership while providing a competitive advantage in certain communities. We are partnering with multiple manufacturers to pilot electric-powered recycling and waste trucks. As electric vehicle technology continues to develop, we expect to further deploy electrification to our fleet. As of December 31, 2024, we operated 52 electric collection vehicles and had 22 commercial scale electric charging facilities.\nStandardized Maintenance\nBased on an industry trade publication, we operate the third largest vocational fleet in the United States. As of December 31, 2024, our average fleet age for recycling and waste collection vehicles in years, by line of business, was as follows:\nApproximate Number of Vehicles\nApproximate Average Age\nResidential\n7,300 \n7.7\nSmall-container\n5,500 \n7.2\nLarge-container\n4,800 \n9.0\nTotal\n17,600 \n7.9\nOneFleet, our standardized vehicle maintenance program, enables us to use best practices for fleet management, truck care and maintenance. Through standardization of core functions, we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes, resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet. Additionally, our focus on preventative maintenance is improving the reliability of our fleet and enabling us to provide superior service to our customers, differentiating us from our competition.\nPeople and Talent Agenda\nBeing human-centered is at the core of our robust people and talent agenda. We strive to maintain an environment that attracts and retains the best talent. Our approximately 42,000 full-time employees are a critical component in successfully executing our strategy and running our operations. We work hard to remain a company where the best people, with exceptional talents and diverse backgrounds, can thrive and foster a culture of caring where people feel respected, supported and encouraged to bring their best selves to work every day.\nWe are dedicated to driving our people and talent agenda, which includes (1) representing the diversity of the communities we serve and sustaining a safe and inclusive culture, (2) maintaining a highly engaged workforce, (3) developing our talent through learning and development experiences and (4) offering rewards that attract and retain the best workforce. We review key \n5\nTable of Contents\nprogress metrics such as engagement and turnover and regularly report on these metrics to our Board of Directors. This level of reporting holds all of our leaders accountable for the continued growth and development of our people.\nInclusion and Diversity\nWe believe the composite strength of our employees’ ideas, built on their unique experiences and backgrounds, is essential to our ability to meet and anticipate our customers’ needs.\n \nWe are proud of the diversity of our frontline workforce, as it closely represents the demographics of the communities we serve. We continue to improve representation of diverse groups across all levels of the Company. Our commitment to inclusion and diversity starts at the top of our organization, as outlined in our Mission of Supporting an Inclusive Culture (MOSAIC), established in 2013 and supported by the MOSAIC Council. The MOSAIC Council consists of leaders from across the Company who serve as ambassadors and thought partners for inclusion and diversity. This enables us to continue to develop new strategies and activities that are tied to the needs of our employees, customers and business with the goal of creating an even more inclusive work environment and diverse workforce.\nWe support inclusion and connectivity for our diverse populations through our Business Resource Groups (BRG) and focus on the involvement of our field locations in all of our BRGs, including Women of Republic, VALOR (Veterans, Advocacy, Learning, Outreach and Recruiting), UNIDOS, the Black Employee Network and PRISM in support of the LGBTQ+ community. In May 2024, we launched a new BRG called AAPI in support of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. \nEmployee Engagement \nWe believe an engaged workforce is a key element of our success as engaged employees deliver better customer service and are more productive. We measure employee engagement through a third-party survey, assessing employee sentiment on a variety of topics such as pride for the Company, job satisfaction and intention to stay. Our data reinforces that business units with a highly engaged workforce experience less turnover. We also found that employees whose leaders are highly inclusive are more likely to speak up and share their perspective. Regularly hearing from our employees allows us to understand how to support and strengthen an exceptional employee experience. Our goal is to achieve and maintain employee engagement scores at or above 88 by 2030. Our employee engagement score was 86 in 2024, which is above a national benchmark by seven points. Approximately 99% of our employees participated in the engagement survey process in March and September 2024, which represented an all-time high participation rate and is 24% higher than the national benchmark. Employee engagement is a core part of our business strategy, which is why we compensate our General Managers, in part, on their employee engagement scores. This reinforces our commitment for leaders to listen and take action on employee feedback and helps to ensure that our leaders are held accountable and rewarded for their efforts to drive a more engaged workforce.\nTalent Development\nWe are committed to providing our employees with opportunities to develop throughout their careers. Our programs, including new hire onboarding and new leader assimilation, reinforce our Company values, expectations and business approach. We relaunched our successful Leadership Fundamentals program in 2022, targeting field leaders. With a goal of reaching all leaders through this program, approximately 1,226 leaders completed this training in 2024, with approximately 1,600 more slated to participate in 2025. Targeted development experiences support the growth of people in key roles, including Driver Training, Technician Training, Supervisor Training, Sales Acceleration and General Manager Onboarding, among others. We believe these programs provide the fundamental skills necessary to be successful across roles. Additionally, to meet the specific needs of the business, we opened a comprehensive Technical Training Institute in April 2021 where we train and develop our technicians. We have had 267 participants in the course since its inception.\nOur leadership programs are a critical part of growing our people. We remain focused on attracting, hiring and developing early career leaders. Our rotational training and development programs, including our General Manager Acceleration Program (GMAP) and Operations Manager Acceleration Program, help us attract, develop and advance a diverse and talented pool of individuals from across our organization. Our Executive Leadership team sponsors these programs, providing visibility and support for the career advancement of our high-potential talent across the organization. Since the beginning of these programs in 2017, 109 leaders have graduated into leadership positions. Additionally, our MBA intern program, with 51 participants since 2019, introduces strong talent to the organization and is a path of opportunity into the GMAP program. We have found that these programs and experiences help ensure that the next generation of leaders build the necessary skills and experiences to be successful in their roles today and in the future.\nWe continue to leverage innovative training methods using mixed mediums to deliver trainings and instruction to our employees across the country. We remain committed to expanding employee participation in learning programs that are relevant to our business strategy and contribute to career advancement for our employees.\n6\nTable of Contents\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer compensation and benefits that help improve our employees' overall financial, physical and emotional wellbeing, as well as recognize hard work with opportunities to grow. Our commitment to paying market competitive wages enables us to attract and hire talent all across the country, including an expansion of many opportunities to work remotely. Our approach to paying for performance supports our focus on pay equity. Our compensation packages are designed to provide employees with a stable and livable wage and growth potential. Our focus on wellness also provides our employees with a competitive paid time off plan, access to preventative care, advice on financial planning and support for mental health, contributing to our efforts to provide a total rewards package that improves and enhances the lives of our employees.\nDifferentiating Capabilities\nTo effectively execute our strategic plan, we prioritize the development and investment in capabilities that will differentiate us in the marketplace. These capabilities include – (1) customer zeal, (2) digital and (3) sustainability.\nCustomer Zeal\nThe goal of customer zeal is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers’ needs. We offer a broad set of environmental services across the United States and Canada as the sole provider, which we believe sets us apart in the industry. Customers appreciate our track record of safe and environmentally compliant operations, with the expertise to manage complex waste streams. We believe our value proposition increases customer loyalty and willingness to pay for our differentiated offerings. Customer zeal is a cultural commitment to enable and empower our employees to own their role in the customer experience.\nTo help our sales team identify specific customer needs and configure the right offering, we use a Priority Based Selling (PBS) technique and our Capture pricing tool nationwide.\n•\nPBS enables us to identify and segment customers’ buying priorities and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings.\n•\nCapture is a cloud-based pricing tool that creates a more professional sales experience, helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale and provides enhanced controls over the price quoting process.\nWe continue to expand our offering of products and services to meet customer demand for a single provider for their environmental service needs. We have made progress on this front, including through the expansion of our environmental solutions segment supported by the acquisition of US Ecology, along with subsequent acquisitions. Our acquisitions of leading environmental solutions providers enable us to offer a complete set of products and services, including treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous and specialty waste. For services that we do not provide, we fulfill demand through our alliance partnerships while maintaining the customer facing relationship.\nTo help ensure a consistent customer experience, we have invested in our customer service capabilities and our centralized Customer Experience function. This modern technology provides our customer services employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better levels of service through a variety of communication channels. The standardized approach enhances the customer experience and provides us a platform to reduce the cost to service our customers.\nTo help ensure our efforts are making an impact and building customer loyalty, we solicit feedback from our customers, including Net Promoter Score℠, so that every General Manager receives recent, relevant feedback that allows him or her the ability to reach out to customers directly and address issues immediately.\nDigital\nThe goal of prioritizing our digital capabilities is to allow us to provide a consistent experience across our business. We believe investments in our digital platforms support improved processes for our employees that lead to enhanced employee engagement and enable our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information, ultimately driving increased customer loyalty. \nBy increasing the ease of use and functionality of our web-based market presence, we believe we enhance customer satisfaction, interaction and connectivity while lowering our costs. These tools reinforce to our customers that they can rely on us to handle their recycling and waste service needs in a way that is easy and convenient for them.\n•\nOur website and mobile app are online account management tools, allowing customers access to their accounts and our services.\n•\nOur e-commerce sales channel allows customers to secure services on a real-time basis, provides capabilities to meet our customers' evolving buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel.\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe are leveraging technology to digitally connect our customers, drivers, logistics analysts, supervisors and trucks via our \"RISE\" dispatch platform and in-cab technology. With the roll-out of this technology we have improved productivity through more real-time routing information and data visualization tools, increasing customer connectivity and enabling automated service verification communications and enhancing the employee experience by providing better tools and technology designed around employee interaction.\nWe have installed advanced technology on recycling and waste collection vehicles that utilizes cameras to identify recycling contamination and overfilled containers. We expect this technology will reduce recycling contamination over time and drive incremental revenue.\nWe are in the early stages of deploying our “MPower” enterprise asset management system to digitally connect our maintenance team to our collection fleet of vehicles. This technology is designed to streamline our fleet maintenance record keeping and parts management processes and allow improved technician efficiency and enhanced warranty recovery across our fleet. We expect the deployment of this technology to be complete in late 2025.\nSustainability\nThe goal of our differentiating sustainability capabilities is to provide our customers with fully integrated sustainable solutions that support a cleaner, safer and healthier world. We have long been a leader in environmental services and sustainability. We introduced our Elements of Sustainability, the foundation of our sustainability platform, in 2014. Our elements, Safety, Talent, Climate Leadership and Communities, are deeply integrated into our business and anchor our ambitious 2030 sustainability goals.\nOur Board of Directors’ Sustainability & Corporate Responsibility Committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance, our corporate responsibilities and our role as a socially responsible organization. The Committee meets at least quarterly to be updated on progress and conducts a formal comprehensive review of the Company’s performance in these areas on an annual basis.\nOur 2030 Sustainability Goals\nAs we grow, so does our opportunity to make a meaningful, positive impact on the environment and society. Our ambitious 2030 goals are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n(1) \nand our greenhouse gas reduction goal is aligned with The Paris Agreement. Each goal is aligned with one of the Company's elements of sustainability. Together they are designed to significantly benefit the environment and society, while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business for the long-term.\n•\nSafety Amplified: \nAchieve zero annual employee fatalities\n•\nIncident Reduction: \nReduce OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) to 2.0 or less by 2030\n•\nEngaged Workforce:\n \nAchieve and maintain employee engagement scores at or above 88 by 2030\n•\nScience Based Target:\n Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2030\n(2)\n, approved by SBTi\n(3)\n, with an interim goal of achieving a 10% reduction by 2025\n(4)\n•\nCircular Economy:\n Increase recovery of key materials by 40% on a combined basis by 2030\n(2)\n•\nRenewable Energy:\n Increase beneficial reuse of biogas by 50% by 2030\n(2)\n•\nCharitable Giving:\n Create sustainable neighborhoods through strong community partnerships for 45 million people by 2030\n(2)\nWe believe that reducing our impact on the planet and improving the quality of life for its inhabitants are the right things to do, and they are also necessary actions to ensure a vibrant future for our organization.\nRefer to our Sustainability Report for our progress toward our 2030 sustainability goals, and refer to our full suite of climate-related sustainability reporting for updates regarding our progress toward our climate goals, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), SASB, Global Reporting Initiative and CDP Climate Change, all of which can be found at republicservices.com/sustainability/reporting.

The predictability of our free cash flows allows us to efficiently execute our capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in value-creating acquisitions and returning free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt, which was rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, A- by Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. Such ratings have allowed us, and should continue to allow us, to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.\nWe manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital.\nDividends\nIn July 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.580 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 8% over the prior year. This increase represented the 21\nst\n consecutive year of a dividend increase. Over the last five years, our dividends have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.4%. We expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value.\nShare Repurchases\nIn October 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization effective starting January 1, 2024, and extending through December 31, 2026. Share repurchases under the current program may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. While the Board of Directors has approved the program, the timing of any purchases, the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management, at its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. On a quarterly basis, our Board of Directors reviews the parameters around which we repurchase our shares. Refer to \nItem 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities \nfor repurchase authority remaining as of December 31, 2024.\nShareholder Value\nWe are committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth while continually improving returns on invested capital. Our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management. We have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters, including environmental, social, governance, talent and executive compensation.\nManagement Team\nWe believe that building and blending a diverse team of strong industry veterans, along with talented people from other industries who bring unique skill sets, will contribute to what we call our Composite Strength. Composite Strength combines the vast, varied experience and capability of both strong environmental services industry veterans and talented people from other industries. Additionally, Composite Strength helps ensure the continuity of leadership and preservation of institutional knowledge, while also bringing in skills and new ideas from other companies outside of our industry - many of them from leading companies.\nJon Vander Ark \nwas named Chief Executive Officer in 2021.

This allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities. We believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization. Our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets. As a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local \n10\nTable of Contents\ncommunities, we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins.\nComprehensive Environmental Services\nWe serve customers with a strong, vertically-integrated operating platform and offer a complete set of products and services, including the collection and processing of recyclable, solid waste and industrial waste materials; transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste streams; and other environmental solutions. We offer a wide array of products and services with a proven track record in safety, compliance and environmental stewardship.\nRecycling & Waste Services\nWe have a strong, national, vertically-integrated operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate. Where appropriate, we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by managing material streams from the point of collection through recycling processing or disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 67% of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate (internalization). Our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our markets that are not fully integrated. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and other market development activities, we create market-specific, vertically-integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations, transfer stations and landfills. We also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority, customers are willing to pay for the service and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment.\nCollection Services\nWe provide residential, small-container and large-container collection services through 367 collection operations. In 2024, approximately 68% of our total revenue was derived from our collection business, of which approximately 18% of our total revenue related to residential services, approximately 30% related to small-container services, approximately 19% related to large-container services and approximately 1% related to other collection services.\nOur residential collection business involves the curbside collection of material for transport to transfer stations, or directly to recycling centers, organics processing facilities, or landfills. We typically perform residential collection services under contracts with municipalities, which we generally secure through competitive bids, which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities. These contracts usually range in duration from one to five years, although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods. We also perform residential services on a subscription basis, in which individual households contract directly with us. The fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market, collection frequency, type of service, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of processing or disposal. In general, subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service.\nIn our small-container business, we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes. We typically perform small-container collection services under one- to three-year service agreements, and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market, collection frequency, type of equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the material collected, transportation costs and the cost of processing or disposal. Our small-container services are typically offered to small business complexes, multi-family housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants, retail, real-estate and professional and other services.\nOur large-container collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships. For the recurring portion, we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large generators of material. We typically perform the collection services under one- to three-year service agreements, and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market, collection frequency, type of equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the material collected, transportation costs and the cost of processing or disposal. Our recurring large-container services are typically offered to larger facilities, hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing, retail, hospitality, professional and other services.\nFor the temporary portion of our large-container collection business, the majority of the material relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically event-driven. We provide temporary collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one-year or longer.\nTransfer Services\nWe own or operate 248 transfer stations. Revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees, which accounted for approximately 5% of our revenue during 2024. Our collection operations deposit material at these transfer stations, as do other private and municipal haulers, for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers. \n11\nTable of Contents\nTransfer stations provide collection operations with a cost-effective means to consolidate material and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional mechanism to extend their geographic reach.\nWhen our own collection operations use our transfer stations, this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to third-party disposal sites. It also allows us to manage costs associated with material disposal because: (1) transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more material to the landfill or processing center in each trip; (2) material is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency; and (3) we can retain volume by managing the material to one of our own landfills or processing centers rather than to a competitor’s.\nRecycling Processing Services\nWe own or operate 75 recycling centers. These centers generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers (OCC), old newsprint (ONP), aluminum, glass and other materials, which accounted for approximately 2% of our total revenue during 2024. Approximately 82% of our total recycling center volume is fiber based and includes OCC, ONP and other mixed paper. During 2024, we processed and sold 2.1 million tons, excluding glass and organics, from our recycling centers. An additional 2.2 million tons were collected by us and delivered to third parties. We are investing in innovative recycling technology and have expanded our organics operations to help customers meet their diversion goals. We processed 1.1 million and sold 0.3 million tons of organic materials, respectively, from our recycling centers in 2024.\nChanging market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately $11 million.\nIn certain instances, we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or large-container customers, which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities, a fixed contractual rate or other measures. We also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at third-party processing facilities.\nWe have met increased consumer demand for recycling services by integrating recycling components across our collection service offerings. Our goal is to provide a complete material stream management solution to our customers in a vertically integrated, environmentally sustainable way.\nWe continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers. For example, robotics and advanced sorting equipment, such as disk screens, magnets and optical sorters, identify and separate different kinds of paper, metals, plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts.\nLandfill Services\nWe own or operate 208 active landfills. Our landfill tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue during 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had 41,158 estimated permitted acres and estimated total available disposal capacity of 5.0 billion in-place cubic yards. The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept non-hazardous special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and contaminated soils.\nMost of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal demand, we are seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills; however, all proposed or future expansions may not be permitted.\nWe also have responsibility for 125 closed landfills, for which we have associated closure and post-closure obligations.\n12\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental Solutions\nWe have the capabilities to address the complex environmental and sustainability needs of our customers. Our environmental solutions offerings include collection, treatment, consolidation, disposal and recycling of hazardous and non-hazardous waste; field and industrial services; equipment rental; emergency response and standby services; and in-plant services. Environmental solutions volume is generated by the daily operations of industrial, petrochemical and refining facilities and oil and natural gas exploration and production sites, including maintenance, plant turnarounds and capital projects. Volume also is generated by private and government funded projects including site remediation, redevelopment or emergency spill response. In 2024, approximately 11% of our revenue was derived from environmental solutions.\nWaste Treatment & Disposal\nWe own or operate 6 active hazardous waste landfills, 9 active energy waste landfills, 2 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 23 treatment, storage and disposal facilities, 5 salt water disposal wells and 14 deep injection wells. We recycle, treat and dispose of hazardous and non-hazardous industrial wastes. The waste streams handled include substances which are classified as “hazardous” because of their corrosive, ignitable, reactive or toxic properties and other wastes subject to federal, state and provincial environmental regulation. The waste we handle comes in solid, liquid and sludge form and can be received in a variety of containerized and bulk forms and transported to our facilities by truck and rail.\nWe also operate thermal desorption units that recover oil and metal bearing catalyst from refinery and other organic and oil-based waste. The recycled oil and recycled catalyst are sold to third parties.\nField Services\nOur field services include a wide range of specialty and total waste management services provided to refineries, chemical plants, manufacturing plants, pharmaceutical manufacturers, technology companies, research laboratories and other government, commercial and industrial facilities either on-site or at our network of facilities. These services include industrial cleaning and maintenance, retail services, lab pack, site remediation, equipment cleaning and maintenance services, specialty equipment rental, transportation and emergency response.\nAs an integral part of our services, we employ highly trained staff and operate a network of service centers that characterize, package and collect hazardous and non-hazardous wastes from customers and transport such wastes to and between our facilities for treatment or bulking for shipment to final disposal locations. \nSustainability Innovation\nWe are uniquely positioned to offer products and services to address the complex sustainability needs of our customers. Our sustainability innovation product and service offerings include operations that allow for greater material circularity and support decarbonization. We believe demand for post-consumer content in consumer packaging and low carbon energy alternatives continues to increase. We are able to invest independently or through joint ventures to create solutions for the evolving marketplace. \nCircularity\nIn 2024, we commenced operations at our first Polymer Center in Las Vegas and completed construction of our second Polymer Center in Indianapolis. Through its Polymer Centers, Republic is the first company to manage the plastics stream through an integrated process from curbside collection of recycled material to production and delivery of high-quality recycled content for consumer packaging. Rigid plastics – polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) – collected from residential and commercial customers and sorted at local recycling facilities are delivered to the Polymer Center for secondary processing. Each facility is expected to produce more than 100 million pounds per year of recycled plastic, including 100% post-consumer PET flake delivered to the food-grade marketplace to enable bottle-to-bottle circularity. In addition, HDPE and PP packaging such as detergent jugs or butter tubs, which today are collected in multicolored bundles, can be separated by plastic type and color. We plan to commence operations at the Indianapolis Polymer Center during 2025 and anticipate opening two additional Polymer Centers in the coming years.\nIn 2023, we announced the creation of Blue Polymers, LLC, a joint venture with Ravago, that will further advance circularity in the plastics industry. The Blue Polymers facilities will utilize the color-sorted recycled HDPE and PP from our Polymer Centers to create custom recycled resins for consumer packaging and other applications. The process is expected to convert recycled HDPE and PP into fully formulated products for use in both food-grade and non-food-grade sustainable applications. Four Blue Polymers facilities are planned to open over the coming years, beginning with an Indianapolis facility in 2025. Once operational, these facilities are expected to produce a combined 300 million pounds per year of recycled plastics. Products are expected to include custom-blended and compounded materials for individual customers to help them achieve their sustainability goals and comply with federal, state or local requirements for recycled content.\n13\nTable of Contents\nDecarbonization\nOur customers are increasingly looking for decarbonization solutions, and Republic is leveraging our network of landfills to meet that need. Republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas, a natural byproduct of decomposing waste, and converting it to energy. More than 87% of our landfill acreage is covered by gas collection systems. Collecting and converting landfill gas into renewable energy provides economic and environmental benefits, including reducing fugitive greenhouse gas emissions. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated 79 landfill gas-to-energy projects. The majority of these projects were developed and are owned by a third party, where we earn a royalty based on renewable energy sold. We presently have 45 landfill gas-to-renewable natural gas (RNG) projects in development that are expected to begin operations in the coming years. The majority of the development portfolio is part of a joint venture with Archaea Energy, a bp company, in which Republic is a minority equity owner. RNG is a low-carbon, pipeline-quality fuel that’s fully interchangeable with fossil fuel-derived natural gas; it can be used as a transportation fuel in commercial fleets, including our own.\nWe also are producing renewable energy at our landfills through solar projects we host at six sites, which generate clean electricity for local communities.\nOther Services\nOther revenue consists primarily of National Accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a competitive industry. Competition in the environmental services industry comes from a few other large, national publicly-owned companies, several regional publicly- and privately-owned companies and thousands of small privately-owned companies. In any given market, competitors may have larger operations and greater resources. In addition, we compete with municipalities that maintain material collection or disposal operations. These municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing.\nWe compete for collection accounts primarily based on our product offering, quality of service and price. From time-to-time, our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract. Our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies. This may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability.\nSeasonality and Severe Weather\nOur operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of large-container and residential recycling and waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality.\nWe provide essential environmental services in the communities we serve and our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather and natural disasters, which could increase the volume of material collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of material, reduce the volume of material delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. These risks may increase with the physical impacts of climate change. The impacts from adverse weather and natural disasters have the potential to last several months and to affect several facilities. We have business continuity plans in place for severe weather, natural disasters and other emergencies—hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, winter storms, earthquakes and wildfires, among others—to help limit disruptions in our operations and\n \nhelp\n \nensure the continuity of our services. Our operations can also be favorably affected by severe weather and natural disasters, which could increase the volume of material in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services. Refer to our TCFD Report for more information on climate impacts and our risk management strategies, available at investor.republicservices.com/sustainability. The information contained on our website shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other filing we make under the Exchange Act.\nRegulation\nOur facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, recycling centers, certain waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate. These permits are subject to denial, revocation, modification and renewal in certain circumstances. Any revocation, modification or denial of permits could have a material \n14\nTable of Contents\nadverse effect on us. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement, which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits, obtain injunctions, or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations, including criminal penalties. The United States EPA and various other federal, state, provincial and local authorities administer these regulations. Regulations with respect to hazardous waste are particularly relevant for our Group 3 reportable segment that provides treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous waste.\nIn order to comply with these regulations, we must incur substantial capital expenditures relating to our vehicles, landfills, transfer stations, recycling centers and other assets, and in connection with our capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities. Compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, including changes relating to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as PFAS) and other chemicals of emerging concern, and limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste, could increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures. \nA decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors. Further, we compete with counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities, and have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing.\nWe strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines, penalties or settlements. Citations and notices may be issued in the future, notwithstanding our strong regulatory compliance efforts. We have established final capping, closure, post-closure and remediation reserves that we believe, based on currently available information, will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs; however, actual costs may exceed our reserves.\nFederal Regulation\nThe following summarizes the primary federal, environmental and occupational health and safety-related statutes that affect our facilities and operations:\n•\nThe Solid Waste Disposal Act, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n (RCRA). RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills.\nSubtitle C of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of hazardous waste, and Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle C set requirements for hazardous waste generators, transporters and treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Regulations under Subtitle D currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions, facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards, groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards. The EPA may authorize states to implement certain hazardous waste requirements of Subtitle C, and if a state program does not exist, the EPA directly implements the hazardous waste requirements. Nearly all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and Subtitles C and D. These state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of Subtitles C and D. Our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit, which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits, reduced revenue from lost operational time and increased third party disposal costs.\nAll of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed Subtitles C and D requirements, as applicable. Operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations. Compliance with Subtitles C and D regulations has resulted in increased capital expenditures and operating costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities.\n•\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980\n (CERCLA). CERCLA, among other things, provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. CERCLA may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site, parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of, parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site. Under the authority of CERCLA and its implementing regulations, detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of \n15\nTable of Contents\nfacilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes, but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances currently characterized by the EPA as hazardous, many of which are found in common household waste. The EPA may also designate additional substances as hazardous; in 2024, the EPA finalized a rule that designated two PFAS as hazardous substances. Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment, or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves. In addition, the EPA has established a National Priorities List of sites at which hazardous substances have been, or are threatened to be, released and which require investigation or cleanup.\nCERCLA liability is strict liability. It can be founded upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of unintentional, non-negligent or lawful action, of hazardous substances, including very small quantities of such substances. Thus, even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances, it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated, or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste. Therefore, we could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of cleaning up, or protecting against the release of, such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources, even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them. The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriately-licensed facilities. Given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability, any such liability could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n•\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972\n (the Clean Water Act). This act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites, into streams, rivers and other waters of the United States. Runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under the Clean Water Act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities, which may affect our operations. If a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works. In addition, states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the Clean Water Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities. Furthermore, if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands, we may be required to secure permits before such development starts. In these situations, permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts.\n•\nThe Clean Air Act.\n The Clean Air Act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources, including landfills. In 1996, the EPA promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems along with landfill gas control systems unless emissions are below established thresholds. These regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification on or after May 30, 1991, and, principally, to landfills that can accommodate 2.5 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste. The regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed. The date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill. In July 2016, the EPA issued final amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or after July 17, 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain non-methane gases, which are recognized as greenhouse gases. In a separate rule finalized at the same time, the EPA issued updates to its 1996 Emission Guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills. Both actions were part of the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan - Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. As part of the Biden Administration's focus on climate change, the EPA has taken further steps to implement these regulations. These and other efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems, with resulting capital or operating costs. Many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas. Certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions. See Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n – \nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other governmental regulations could impose costs on our operations, the magnitude of which is difficult to estimate\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, our vehicle fleet may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbon-emission restrictions. Over the past decade, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The regulations take the form of fuel economy standards. The EPA and the NHTSA have developed fuel economy \n16\nTable of Contents\nstandards in two vehicle categories: (1) passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks (collectively, light-duty vehicles); and (2) heavy-duty trucks, including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers. We own and operate vehicles in both categories. EPA and NHTSA periodically issue rules covering additional model years, typically increasing the stringency of the relevant vehicle standards, and those rules are frequently challenged in court.\n•\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970\n (OSHA). This act authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A number of these standards, including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our facilities and operations.\nState and Local Regulation\nEach state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States also have adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. In addition, our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example, several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs, the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally, laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills, including yard waste, food waste, newspapers, beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries, electronic wastes and household appliances, have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others. Some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting “extended producer responsibility” regulations, which are designed to obligate producers to fund the post-use life cycle of their products by providing recycling programs for their products. State and municipal governments also have enacted or may enact “organic diversion” regulations that require food waste to be managed separately from the other waste streams, similar to the rules recently enacted in California. Several states have also enacted or are considering “minimum recycled content” regulations mandating certain minimum post-consumer recycled content in certain types of packaging, including California. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction and recycling also have been considered, or are under consideration by, the United States Congress and the EPA. These regulations may present new opportunities to offer sustainable environmental services to our customers but may require investment of time, effort and money to be able to offer these new solutions and expose us to additional regulatory requirements and competition from others offering these services.\nTo construct, operate and expand a landfill, we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and land use approvals. These permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with, are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups, may be subject to periodic renewal, and are subject to denial, modification, non-renewal and revocation by the issuing agency. Significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes. In connection with our acquisition of existing landfills, we may be required to spend considerable time, effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity.\nCanadian Waste Regulation\nCertain of our Group 3 operations and facilities are subject to, among other regulations, Canadian hazardous and non-hazardous waste regulations. The Canadian federal government regulates issues within federal jurisdiction, including activities that cross provincial boundaries or affect Canada’s relations with other nations. The Canadian provinces also have jurisdiction over environmental matters within their respective boundaries, including primary responsibility for regulation and management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.\nThe main federal laws governing waste management are the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is the federal agency with responsibility for environmental matters. CEPA charges ECCC and Health Canada with the protection of human health and the environment and seeks to control the production, importation and use of substances in Canada and their impact on the environment. The Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations under CEPA control the transboundary movement of hazardous waste and hazardous recyclable materials. These regulations require that anyone proposing to export or import hazardous waste or hazardous recyclable materials or transport them through Canada notify ECCC and obtain a permit to do so.\nCertain of our facilities are subject to the Québec Environment Quality Act, the Ontario Environmental Protection Act or the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and their respective regulations. These statutes and regulations regulate the generation, collection, characterization, documentation, transport, storage, treatment, recovery and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, establish the requirements for waste management facilities and waste transportation systems and govern actual or potential releases of contaminants in the environment, such as air emissions and soil, groundwater \n17\nTable of Contents\nand surface water contamination issues. Similarly, the federal Fisheries Act and provincial statutes such as the Ontario Water Resources Act also regulate releases of contaminants to bodies of water. \nHazardous waste transporters are required to hold permits to operate under the provincial statutes and regulations and are also subject to safety documentation and reporting requirements under provincial law and the federal Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992.\nMaritime Regulations\nOur Group 3 operations own and use 63 vessels registered under the United States flag. Accordingly, we are subject to various United States federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of our vessels. Our United States-flag vessels are subject to the direct jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard, the United States Customs and Border Protection and the United States Maritime Administration as well as other federal and state agencies. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the local laws of foreign jurisdictions when we operate outside of the United States.\nA portion of the operations of our standby services business within Group 3 is conducted in the United States coastwise trade. This is a protected market that is subject to United States cabotage laws that impose certain restrictions on the ownership and operation of vessels in the United States coastwise trade. These laws are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. Chapters 121, 505 and 551 and the related regulations, which are commonly referred to collectively as the “Jones Act.” The Jones Act restricts transportation of merchandise by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in United States coastwise trade be owned and operated by United States citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, be built in and registered under the laws of the United States and manned by predominantly United States citizen crews. We have compliance mechanisms in place designed to assist with monitoring and maintaining compliance with the ownership requirements of the Jones Act.\nAll of our offshore vessels are subject to either United States or international safety and classification standards and sometimes both. United States-flag vessels, barges and crew boats are required to undergo periodic inspections pursuant to United States Coast Guard regulations.\nWe are also subject to a number of safety, security and environmental laws and regulations, including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, CERCLA, the Clean Air Act, and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPFS Code), an amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as implemented in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of SOLAS and the ISPS Code. The ISPS Code provides that owners or operators of certain vessels and facilities must provide security and security plans for their vessels and facilities and obtain appropriate certification of compliance. Under the ISPS Code, we perform worldwide security assessments, risk analyses and develop vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, we have developed security annexes for those United States-flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the United States Coast Guard pursuant to the latest revision of Marsec Directive 104-6.\nOther Regulations\nSome of our facilities and operations are subject to the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA) and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA). TSCA regulates the treatment, storage and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and asbestos. The AEA assigns the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) regulatory authority over receipt, possession, use and transfer of certain radioactive materials, including disposal. The USNRC has adopted regulations for licensing commercial low-level radioactive waste regulated under the AEA for disposal and has delegated regulatory authority to certain states, including states where one or more of our facilities are located. The USNRC and United States Department of Transportation regulate the transport of radioactive materials. Shippers must comply with both the general requirements for hazardous materials transportation and specific requirements for transporting radioactive materials.\nMany of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleum-based products. These tanks can be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing, upgrading, closure and removal. In the event of leaks or releases from these tanks, these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated. If underground storage tanks we own or operate leak, we could be liable for response costs and, if the leakage migrates onto the property of others, we could be liable for damages to third parties. We are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWith regard to our solid waste transportation operations, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board and are regulated by the Federal Highway Administration, Office of Motor Carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters. Various state and local government authorities have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and \n18\nTable of Contents\nregulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county, or other jurisdictional lines. In 1978, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out-of-state solid waste is unconstitutional; however, states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation, imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional. In 2007, however, the United States Supreme Court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly-owned and publicly-operated waste facility. A number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries. Other governments may enact similar regulations in the future. These regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal, thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results.\nWe are engaged in 79 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects. The production of renewable fuel through certain of these projects is incentivized by the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, which was authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Oil refiners and importers are required through the RFS program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits, known as renewable identification numbers (RINs), from renewable fuel producers. The amount of RIN credits generated by each gallon of renewable fuel depends on the process and feedstock used to create the specific renewable fuel. There is a market for RINs and, as we and/or our partners produce RFS-compliant renewable fuel, RINs are generated and sold to parties purchasing such RINs to achieve compliance with the RFS program. \nClimate and Sustainability Trends\nJurisdictions have been updating climate policies toward the goal of reporting and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a broad range of sustainability initiatives. We believe reducing our impact on the planet and improving the quality of life of its inhabitants are the right things to do, and have committed to heightened emissions reduction goals. Taking into account the challenges associated with quantifying environmental services emissions precisely, we evaluate and offer strategic opportunities to provide our customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions as new regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change arise. As a provider of a highly regulated public service, we recognize the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and we actively seek opportunities for discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we cooperate with and support initiatives at the federal and state level that encourage sustainable practices including the production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity and the processing of recyclables and organics.\nWe have long been a leader in sustainability as it relates to environmental services and strive to maintain this reputation. Our sustainability commitments, as well as our progress toward our current goals, are published in our Sustainability Report and accompanying reports and can be found at investor.republicservices.com/sustainability. The information contained on our website shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other filing we make under the Exchange Act.\nLiabilities Established for Landfill and Environmental Costs\nWe have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs, which include landfill site final capping, closure and post-closure costs. We periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of Subtitles C and D of RCRA, and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping, closure and post-closure costs accordingly. Based on current information and regulatory requirements, we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate; however, environmental laws may change, and our recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations, future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us. Refer to the \nMaterial Cash Requirements and Intended Uses of Cash\n section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and to Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. \nLiability Insurance and Bonding\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations, including damages to the environment, property, employees or the general public, or those resulting from cyber incidents. We focus on operating safely and prudently, but occasionally we receive claims, alleging damages, negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work, which resulted in harm to the environment, property, employees or the general public. These liabilities can be significant. We also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements. We maintain various policies of insurance that, subject to limitations, exclusions, or deductibles, provide coverage for these types of claims. While we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business, \n19\nTable of Contents\nsuch insurance may not be adequate, in scope or amount, in the event of a major loss, and we may be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may choose not to continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive.\nAccruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance. As we assume more risk through higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense.\nIn the normal course of business, we also purchase surety bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit, or marketable securities deposits in connection with, among other things, municipal residential collection contracts, financial assurance for closure and post-closure of landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance. \nAvailability of Reports and Other Information\nOur corporate website is \nrepublicservices.com\n.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor further discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in our Annual Report on \nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\n. \nRecent Developments\n2025 Financial Guidance\nIn 2025, we will focus on pricing in excess of cost inflation, driving profitable volume growth, investing in sustainability to improve the environment and drive growth, investing in value-creating acquisitions and advancing technology to improve productivity and increase customer retention. Specific guidance follows:\nRevenue\nWe expect revenue to be in the range of $16.850 billion to $16.950 billion. We expect growth from average yield on total revenue to be approximately 4% and related revenue to be approximately 5%. We expect the impact from volume on total revenue to be in a range of (0.25%) to 0.25%. \nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\nThe following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2025 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2024.

See Item 1A. \nRisk Factors - Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n.\nOverview\nRepublic is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue. As of December 31, 2024, we operated across the United States and Canada through 367 collection operations, 248 transfer stations, 75 recycling centers, 208 active landfills, 2 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 23 treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF), 5 salt water disposal wells, 14 deep injection wells and 1 polymer center. We are engaged in 79 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 125 closed landfills.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by 7.1% to $16,032 million compared to $14,965 million in 2023. This change in revenue is due to increased average yield of 5.1%, acquisitions, net of divestitures of 2.6%, recycling processing \n36\nTable of Contents\nand commodity sales of 0.5%, change in workdays of 0.3% and environmental solutions revenue of 0.1%, partially offset by decreased volume of 1.1% and fuel recovery fees of 0.4%.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue, costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\n \n2024\n2023\nRevenue\n$\n16,032 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n14,965 \n100.0 \n%\nExpenses:\nCost of operations\n9,350 \n58.3 \n8,943 \n59.8 \nDepreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment\n1,517 \n9.5 \n1,368 \n9.1 \nAmortization of other intangible assets\n79 \n0.5 \n66 \n0.4 \nAmortization of other assets\n81 \n0.5 \n67 \n0.5 \nAccretion\n107 \n0.7 \n98 \n0.7 \nSelling, general and administrative\n1,674 \n10.4 \n1,609 \n10.8 \nAdjustment to withdrawal liability for multiemployer pension funds\n— \n— \n5 \n— \nGain on business divestitures and impairments, net\n(1)\n— \n(4)\n— \nRestructuring charges\n29 \n0.2 \n33 \n0.2 \nOperating income\n$\n3,196 \n19.9 \n%\n$\n2,780 \n18.5 \n%\nOur pre-tax income was $2,432 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $2,191 million in 2023.

We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definitions of adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, \n37\nTable of Contents\nadjusted net income – Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures p\nresented by other companies. Further information on each of these adjustments is included below.\nRestructuring charges. \nIn 2024 and 2023, we incurred restructuring charges of \n$29 million\n and \n$33 million\n, respectively. The 2024 charges primarily related to the redesign of our asset management, and customer and order management software systems. Of the 2023 charges, $9 million related to the early termination of certain leases and $24 million related to the redesign of our asset management, and customer and order management software systems. We paid \n$25 million\n and \n$39 million\n during 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts.\nIn 2025, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $15 million, primarily \nr\nelated to the design and implementation of a new accounts receivable system. Substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate entities and other segment.\nGain on extinguishment of debt and other related costs, net\n. During \n2024\n, we recognized a loss of \n$2 million\n due to the amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility. Additionally, we recorded a net gain of \n$8 million\n attributable to the early settlement of certain cash flow hedges related to the Term Loan Facility. The gain was recognized as a reduction of interest expense. During \n2023\n,we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the early repayment of a portion of our Term Loan Facility. We incurred non-cash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized deferred issuance costs of less than $1 million.\nGain on certain divestitures and impairments, net. \nDuring 2024, we recorded a\n \nnet gain on certain divestitures and impairments of $30 million, of which $29 million was due to a gain on the sale of a transfer station facility and $1 million related to a gain on business divestitures and impairments. During 2023, we recorded a net gain of $4 million related to business divestitures and impairments.\nSettlements and withdrawals on pension plans. \nDuring 2024, we recognized a settlement of our defined benefit pension plan. The settlement included a combination of lump-sum payments to participants who elected to receive them and the transfer of benefit obligations to a third-party insurance company under a group annuity contract. As a result of the settlements, we recognized a non-cash gain of $8 million related to the accelerated recognition of the proportional share of unamortized net actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n \nDuring 2023, we recorded a charge to earnings of $5 million for a withdrawal event at multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute.\nUS Ecology, Inc. acquisition integration and deal costs.\n In 2023, we incurred acquisition integration and deal costs of $34 million in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology, which included certain costs to integrate the business. The acquisition closed on \nMay 2, 2022, and our integration of the business was substantially complete as of December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue by providing environmental services to our customers, including the collection and processing of recyclable materials, the collection, treatment, consolidation, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental solutions. Our residential, small-container and large-container collection operations in some markets are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. Certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index. We generally provide small-container and large-container collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. Our recycling centers generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities. Our revenue from environmental solutions primarily consists of (1) fees we charge for the collection, treatment, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, (2) field and industrial services, (3) equipment rental, (4) emergency response and standby services, (5) in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics, including at our TSDFs and (6) in-plant services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response at refineries, chemical, steel and automotive plants and other governmental, commercial and industrial facilities. Other non-core revenue consists primarily of revenue from National Accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators.

Additionally, we experienced declines in our residential, small-container and transfer lines of business primarily attributable to certain municipal contract losses and broker-related business.\n•\nRevenue increased by 0.3% due to the impact of the number of workdays during 2024 as compared to 2023, which drove an increase in volume across all lines of business.\n•\nRecycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 0.5% primarily due to an increase in overall commodity prices as compared to 2023. The average price for recycled commodities, excluding glass and organics, for 2024 was $164 per ton compared to $117 per ton for 2023.\nChanging market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately $11 million.\n•\nDuring 2024, environmental solutions revenue increased by 0.1%\n \nprimarily due to an increase in event-based volumes and price increases relative to the same period in 2023. \n•\nAcquisitions, net of divestitures, increased revenue by 2.6%, reflecting the results of our continued growth strategy of acquiring environmental services companies that complement and expand our existing business platform. \nCost of Operations\nCost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators that provide waste handling services associated with our National Accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits; disposal fees and taxes, consisting of landfill taxes, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal, remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management costs, which include insurance premiums and claims; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on the sale of assets used in our operations.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\n \n2024\n2023\nLabor and related benefits\n$\n3,213 \n20.0 \n%\n$\n2,994 \n20.0 \n%\nTransfer and disposal costs\n1,101 \n6.9 \n1,055 \n7.1 \nMaintenance and repairs\n1,468 \n9.2 \n1,388 \n9.3 \nTransportation and subcontract costs\n1,212 \n7.6 \n1,171 \n7.8 \nFuel\n470 \n2.9 \n542 \n3.6 \nDisposal fees and taxes\n351 \n2.2 \n348 \n2.3 \nLandfill operating costs\n367 \n2.3 \n335 \n2.2 \nRisk management\n401 \n2.4 \n385 \n2.6 \nOther\n796 \n5.5 \n725 \n4.9 \nSubtotal\n9,379 \n59.0 \n8,943 \n59.8 \nGain on certain divestitures and impairments, net\n(29)\n(0.7)\n— \n— \nTotal cost of operations\n$\n9,350 \n58.3 \n%\n$\n8,943 \n59.8 \n%\nThese cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by component to that of other companies and of ours for prior periods.\nOur cost of operations increased in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of the following:\n•\nLabor and related benefits increased in aggregate dollars due to higher hourly and salaried wages as a result of annual merit increases. Acquisition-related growth also contributed to the increase in labor and related benefits.\n•\nTransfer and disposal costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to acquisition-related growth and higher disposal rates.\nDuring 2024 approximately 67% of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate (internalization), as compared to 68% in 2023.\n•\nMaintenance and repairs expense increa\nse\nd in aggregate dollars due to higher hourly wages as a result of annual merit increases, parts inflation and an increase in third-party maintenance\n.\n \nAcquisition-related growth also contributed to the increase in maintenance and repairs expense. \n•\nTransportation and subcontract costs increased in aggregate dollars \ndue to an increase in transportation rates\n. \nAcquisition-related growth also contributed to the increase in transportation and subcontract costs.\n•\nOur fuel costs decreased due to a decrease in the average diesel fuel cost per gallon. The national average diesel fuel cost per gallon for \n2024 was $3.76 compared to $4.21 for 2023.\nAt current consumption levels, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately $27 million per year. Offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers. At current participation rates, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately $38 million per year.\n•\nDisposal fees and taxes increased in aggregate dollars in 2024 primarily due to increased royalties and host fees from an increase in volume at certain landfills as compared to 2023.\n•\nLandfill operating costs increased during 2024 primarily due to increased leachate transportation and maintenance on our gas extraction systems due in part to increased rainfall in select geographic regions, as well as an increase in remediation adjustments recorded during 2024.\n•\nRisk management expenses increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to higher premium costs as well as unfavorable claims development in our auto liability program, partially offset by favorable claims development in our general and worker's compensation liability programs. \n•\nOther costs of operations increased in aggregate dollars during 2024 due to increased occupancy and facility related expenses as well as acquisition-related activity. These increases were partially offset by a favorable non-recurring insurance recovery related to a prior year claim.\n41\nTable of Contents\nDepreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment\nThe following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\n \n2024\n2023\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment\n$\n1,003 \n6.3 \n%\n$\n897 \n6.0 \n%\nLandfill depletion and amortization\n514 \n3.2 \n471 \n3.1 \nDepreciation, amortization and depletion expense\n$\n1,517 \n9.5 \n%\n$\n1,368 \n9.1 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to assets added through acquisitions.\nLandfill depletion and amortization expense increased in aggregate dollars due to an increase in our overall average depletion rate.\nAmortization of Other Intangible Assets\nAmortization of other intangible assets primarily relates to customer relationships and, to a lesser extent, non-compete agreements. Expenses for amortization of other intangible assets were $79 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $66 million, or 0.4% of revenue, for 2023. Amortization expense increased due to additional assets acquired as a result of our business acquisitions.\nAmortization of Other Assets\nOur other assets primarily relate to the prepayment of fees and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloud-based hosting arrangements. Expenses for amortization of other assets were $81 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $67 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for 2023.\nAccretion Expense\nAccretion expense was $107 million, or 0.7% of revenue, and $98 million, or 0.7% of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems and clerical and administrative departments. Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, legal settlements, marketing, investor and community relations services, directors’ and officers’ insurance, general employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges. Restructuring charges are excluded from selling, general and administrative expenses and are discussed separately.\nThe following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\n \n2024\n2023\nSalaries and related benefits\n$\n1,129 \n7.0 \n%\n$\n1,050 \n7.0 \n%\nProvision for doubtful accounts\n27 \n0.2 \n53 \n0.4 \nOther\n518 \n3.2 \n472 \n3.1 \nSubtotal\n1,674 \n10.4 \n1,575 \n10.5 \nUS Ecology, Inc. acquisition integration and deal costs\n— \n— \n34 \n0.2 \nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n1,674 \n10.4 \n%\n$\n1,609 \n10.7 \n%\nThese cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies and of ours for prior periods.\nThe most significant items affecting our selling, general and administrative expenses during 2024 as compared to 2023 are summarized below:\n•\nSalaries and related benefits increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to higher wages and benefits resulting from annual merit increases as well as higher management incentive expense as a result of outperforming our annual incentive metrics. Acquisition-related growth also contributed to the growth in salaries and related benefits.\n42\nTable of Contents\n•\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased\n \nprimarily due to improvements in our cash collections and days sales outstanding as well as favorable adjustments to reserves established in a prior year. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our days sales outstanding were 40.9, or 30.0 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 42.0, or 30.9 days net of deferred revenue, as of December 31, 2023.\n•\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, largely due to an increase in meeting and travel costs, consulting costs and acquisition-related growth, partially offset by a favorable legal settlement.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 we incurred $34 million of acquisition integration and deal costs with the acquisition of US Ecology, primarily related to the integration of certain software systems as well as rebranding of the business. Our integration of the business was substantially complete as of December 31, 2023.\nGain on Business Divestitures and Impairments, Net\nWe strive to have a leading market position in each of the markets we serve, or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time. Where we cannot establish a leading market position, or where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets. Business divestitures could result in gains, losses or impairment charges that m\nay be material to our results of operations in a given period.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of $1 million and $4 million, respectively. \nRestructuring Charges\nFor a discussion or restructuring charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 see \nOverview \nof this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the components of interest expense, including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars):\n2024\n2023\nInterest expense on debt\n$\n479 \n$\n430 \nNon-cash interest\n71 \n86 \nLess: capitalized interest\n(11)\n(8)\nTotal interest expense\n$\n539 \n$\n508 \nTotal interest expense for 2024 increased compared to 2023 primarily due to higher interest rates on our fixed rate debt. The increase attributable to our fixed rate debt is primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in 2024 with coupons ranging from 5.000% to 5.200%, the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding senior notes with a coupon of 2.500%. This increase was partially offset by a gain of $8 million recognized in 2024 attributable to the early settlement of certain cash flow hedges related to the Term Loan Facility. The gain was recognized as a reduction of non-cash interest expense. \nCash paid for interest, excluding net swap settlements for our fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, was $487 million and $423 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $2,160 million of floating rate debt including floating rate swap contracts. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt, annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $22 million.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024\n, \nwe recognized a loss of\n \n$2 million due to the amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility.\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt due to the early repayment of a portion of our Term Loan Facility. We incurred non-cash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized deferred issuance costs of less than $1 million.\nAdjustment to Withdrawal Liability for Multiemployer Pension Funds\nDuring \n2023, we recorded a $5 million charge related to the withdrawal from a certain multiemployer pension plan. As we obtain updated information regarding multiemployer pension funds, the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change, which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs. \n43\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes was $388 million and $460 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate, exclusive of non-controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 16% and 21%, respectively. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately \n$313 million and\n \n$343 million\n for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring \n2024\n, we acquired non-controlling interests in limited liability companies established to own renewable energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. We account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investment in loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statements of income. For further discussion regarding our equity method accounting, see Note 3, \nBusiness Acquisitions, Investments and Restructuring Charges\n. Our \n2024\n tax provision reflects a benefit of $222 million due to the tax credits related to these investments. \nWe also made qualified investments in renewable natural gas and commercial electric vehicles during 2024 which, due to tax credits, reduced our tax provision by approximately \n$18 million\n.\nOur \n2023\n tax provision was reduced by \n$87 million\n related to the tax credits from our non-controlling interests in limited liability companies established to own renewable energy assets. \nIn addition, during 2023 we resolved IRS examinations for our tax years 2014 - 2018 that, in the aggregate, reduced our tax provision by approximately $21 million\n.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated tax effect of $50 million available as of December 31, 2024. These state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2025 and 2044. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states. In recognition of this risk, as of December 31, 2024, we have provided a valuation allowance of \n$45 million.\nFor additional discussion and detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, \nIncome Taxes\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReportable Segments\nOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through three field groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States, the eastern seaboard of the United States, and Canada. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating primarily in geographic areas located across the United States and Canada. These groups are presented below as our reportable segments, which each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal. \nCorporate entities and other include marketing, operations support, business development, legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources and other administrative functions. National Accounts revenue included in Corporate entities and other represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. Revenue and overhead costs of Corporate entities and other are either specifically assigned or allocated on a rational and consistent basis among our reportable segments to calculate adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment.\n44\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA is the single financial measure our chief operating decision maker (CODM) uses to evaluate operating segment profitability and determine resource allocations. Cost of operations and selling, general and administrative are significant segment expenses used in the evaluation. Summarized financial information regarding our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars) follows. For totals as well as further detail regarding our reportable segments and the adjustments used to calculate adjusted EBITDA for each segment, see Note 15, \nSegment Reporting\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\nRecycling & Waste Subtotal \n(1)\nGroup 3\n(Environmental Solutions)\nCorporate entities and other\nTotal\n2024\nGross Revenue\n$\n8,332 \n$\n7,891 \n$\n16,223 \n$\n1,864 \n$\n331 \n$\n18,418 \nIntercompany Revenue\n(1,235)\n(1,037)\n(2,272)\n(49)\n(65)\n(2,386)\nRevenue Allocations\n123 \n115 \n238 \n28 \n(266)\n— \nNet Revenue\n$\n7,220 \n$\n6,969 \n$\n14,189 \n$\n1,843 \n$\n— \n$\n16,032 \nCost of Operations\n4,129 \n4,079 \n8,208 \n1,142 \n— \n9,350 \nSG&A\n738 \n671 \n1,409 \n265 \n— \n1,674 \nOther Segment Items\n— \n29 \n29 \n— \n— \n29 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,353 \n$\n2,190 \n$\n4,543 \n$\n436 \n$\n— \n$\n4,979 \nCapital Expenditures\n$\n874 \n$\n574 \n$\n1,448 \n$\n136 \n$\n271 \n$\n1,855 \nTotal Assets\n$\n14,250 \n$\n11,046 \n$\n25,296 \n$\n4,459 \n$\n2,647 \n$\n32,402 \nGroup 1\nGroup 2\nRecycling & Waste Subtotal(1)\nGroup 3\n(Environmental Solutions)\nCorporate entities and other\nTotal\n2023\nGross Revenue\n$\n7,769 \n$\n7,566 \n$\n15,335 \n$\n1,701 \n$\n243 \n$\n17,279 \nIntercompany Revenue\n(1,171)\n(1,011)\n(2,182)\n(56)\n(76)\n(2,314)\nRevenue Allocations\n96 \n91 \n187 \n(20)\n(167)\n— \nNet Revenue\n$\n6,694 \n$\n6,646 \n$\n13,340 \n$\n1,625 \n$\n— \n$\n14,965 \nCost of Operations\n3,878 \n4,033 \n7,911 \n1,032 \n— \n8,943 \nSG&A\n681 \n649 \n1,330 \n279 \n— \n1,609 \nOther Segment Items\n— \n— \n— \n(34)\n— \n(34)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,135 \n$\n1,964 \n$\n4,099 \n$\n348 \n$\n— \n$\n4,447 \nCapital Expenditures\n$\n707 \n$\n542 \n$\n1,249 \n$\n145 \n$\n237 \n$\n1,631 \nTotal Assets\n$\n13,665 \n$\n10,988 \n$\n24,653 \n$\n4,471 \n$\n2,286 \n$\n31,410 \n(1) The Recycling & Waste Subtotal represents the combined results of our Group 1 and Group 2 reportable segments.\nSignificant changes in the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of our reportable segments for 2024 compared to 2023 are discussed below.\nGroup 1\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 1 increased from $2,135 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $2,353 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nThe most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 1 during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\n•\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 7.9% from 2023 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business partially offset by volume declines in our large container collection and landfill lines of business.\n•\nCost of operations increased due to an increase in labor and third party maintenance costs due to inflationary pressures. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by decreases in fuel costs due to a decrease in average fuel cost per gallon.\n•\nTotal assets increased primarily due to additions in property and equipment.\nGroup 2\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 2 increased from $1,964 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $2,190 million for the \n45\nTable of Contents\nyear ended December 31, 2024. \nThe most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 2 during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\n•\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 4.9% from 2023 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and increased volume in our landfill line of business. These increases were partially offset by decreased volume in our collection and transfer lines of business.\n•\nCost of operations increased due to an increase in labor and maintenance costs due to inflationary pressures. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by decreases in fuel costs due to a decrease in average fuel cost per gallon.\nGroup 3\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 3 increased from $348 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $436 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nThe most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 3 during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\n•\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased due to acquisition-related growth, favorable pricing, and an increase in event-based volumes.\n•\nCost of operations increased primarily due to an increase in labor costs and the impact of acquisitions.\nLandfill and Environmental Matters\nOur landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post-closure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment, transportation and disposal costs, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs, interim cap maintenance costs and costs associated with applying daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site, including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed.\nCost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in cost estimates, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information.\n46\nTable of Contents\nAvailable Airspace\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we owned or operated 208 active landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 5 billion in-place cubic yards. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity, as measured in cubic yards of airspace as of \nDecember 31, 2024.\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nNew\nExpansions\nUndertaken\nLandfills\nAcquired,\nNet of\nDivestitures\nPermits Granted / \nNew Sites,\nNet of Closures\nAirspace\nConsumed\nChanges in\nEngineering\nEstimates\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nCubic yards (in millions):\nPermitted airspace\n4,821 \n— \n— \n7 \n(87)\n4 \n4,745 \nProbable expansion airspace\n283 \n4 \n— \n(5)\n— \n— \n282 \nTotal cubic yards (in millions)\n5,104 \n4 \n— \n2 \n(87)\n4 \n5,027 \nNumber of sites:\nPermitted airspace\n207 \n— \n1 \n— \n208 \nProbable expansion airspace\n14 \n1 \n— \n(1)\n14 \nThe following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity for these landfills, as measured in cubic yards of airspace, as of December 31, 2023\n.\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\nNew\nExpansions\nUndertaken\nLandfills\nAcquired,\nNet of\nDivestitures\nPermits Granted / \nNew Sites,\nNet of Closures\nAirspace\nConsumed\nChanges in\nEngineering\nEstimates\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nCubic yards (in millions):\nPermitted airspace\n4,817 \n— \n40 \n47 \n(86)\n3 \n4,821 \nProbable expansion airspace\n198 \n124 \n— \n(39)\n— \n— \n283 \nTotal cubic yards (in millions)\n5,015 \n124 \n40 \n8 \n(86)\n3 \n5,104 \nNumber of sites:\nPermitted airspace\n206 \n— \n3 \n(2)\n207 \nProbable expansion airspace\n13 \n3 \n— \n(2)\n14 \nTotal available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. Engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. See Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\n and Note 8, \nLandfill and Environmental Costs\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Also see our \nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\n section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 14 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these 14 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 49 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 56 years. We have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2024:\nNumber\nof Sites\nwithout\nProbable\nExpansion\nAirspace\nNumber\nof Sites\nwith\nProbable\nExpansion\nAirspace\nTotal\nSites\nPercent\nof\nTotal\n0 to 5 years\n23 \n— \n23 \n11 \n%\n6 to 10 years\n21 \n1 \n22 \n11 \n11 to 20 years\n34 \n4 \n38 \n18 \n21 to 40 years\n49 \n5 \n54 \n26 \n41+ years\n67 \n4 \n71 \n34 \nTotal\n194 \n14 \n208 \n100 \n%\nFinal Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nAs of December 31, 2024, accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs were $2,144 million, of which $96 million were current and $2,048 million were long-term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRemediation and Other Charges for Landfill Matters\nIt is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor a description of our significant remediation matters, see Note 8, \nLandfill and Environmental Costs,\n of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment in Landfills\nAs of December 31, 2024, we expect to spend an estimated additional $12 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be \n$17 billion\n, or \n$3.36 \nper cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units-of-consumption method.\nThe following table reflects our future expected investment as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nExpected\nFuture\nInvestment\nTotal\nExpected\nInvestment\nNon-depletable landfill land\n$\n195 \n$\n— \n$\n195 \nLandfill development costs\n10,518 \n11,988 \n22,506 \nConstruction-in-progress – landfill\n437 \n— \n437 \nAccumulated depletion and amortization\n(6,031)\n— \n(6,031)\nNet investment in landfill land and development costs\n$\n5,119 \n$\n11,988 \n$\n17,107 \n48\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non-depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\nNumber of landfills owned or operated\n208 \n207 \nNet investment, excluding non-depletable land (in millions)\n$\n4,924 \n$\n4,745 \nTotal estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards)\n5,027 \n5,104 \nNet investment per cubic yard\n$\n0.98 \n$\n0.93 \nLandfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions)\n$\n514 \n$\n471 \nAccretion expense (in millions)\n107 \n98 \n621 \n569 \nAirspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards)\n87 \n86 \nDepletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed\n$\n7.14 \n$\n6.62 \nDuring 2024 and 2023, our average compaction rate was approximately 2,000 pounds per cubic yard based primarily on a three-year historical moving average. \nProperty and Equipment\nThe following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in millions of dollars):\nGross Property and Equipment\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nCapital\nAdditions\nRetirements\nAcquisitions,\nNet of\nDivestitures\nNon-Cash\nAdditions\nfor Asset\nRetirement\nObligations\nAdjustments\nfor\nAsset\nRetirement\nObligations\nImpairments,\nTransfers\nand\nOther\nAdjustments\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nLand\n$\n878 \n$\n5 \n$\n(3)\n$\n18 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(1)\n$\n897 \nLandfill development costs\n9,911 \n5 \n— \n6 \n61 \n90 \n445 \n10,518 \nVehicles and equipment\n10,232 \n848 \n(357)\n4 \n— \n— \n271 \n10,998 \nBuildings and improvements\n1,922 \n44 \n(5)\n18 \n— \n— \n140 \n2,119 \nConstruction-in-progress -

Our known current- and long-term uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures and leases, (2) acquisitions, (3) dividend payments, (4) \n50\nTable of Contents\npayments to service debt and other long-term obligations, (5) payments for asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities and (6) share repurchases. \nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in property and equipment primarily to allow for growth of our service offerings. These investments are largely concentrated in vehicles and equipment and costs to construct our landfills. We expect to receive between $1.86 billion to $1.90 billion of property and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, in 2025.\nWe lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of business under various lease agreements. The most significant lease obligations are for real property and equipment specific to our industry, including property operated as a landfill or transfer station and operating equipment. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating and finance leases was $269 million and $445 million, respectively. For additional detail regarding our lease obligations, see Note 10, \nLeases\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAcquisitions\nOur acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and waste companies and environmental solutions businesses that complement our existing business platform. We continue to invest in value-enhancing acquisitions in existing markets. \nWe expect to invest approximately $1 billion in acquisitions in 2025.\nDividend Payments\nIn October 2024\n our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of \n$0.580 \nper share. Aggregate cash dividends declared were \n$699 million\n for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a quarterly dividend payable of $181 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2025, which was paid on January 15, 2025.\nDebt and other long-term obligations\nDebt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and our availability to draw on our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due.\nWe may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable. Early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid. The loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs.\nIn May 2022, we entered into a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of unsecured commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500 million outstanding at any one time (the Commercial Paper Cap). In August 2022, the Commercial Paper Cap was increased to $1.0 billion, and in October 2023, was subsequently increased to $1.5 billion. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024 was 4.646% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 18 days. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility (as defined below) to fund the amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program until they are re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the total principal value of our debt was $12.8 billion, of which $862 million is due in 2025. \nWe have several agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under these put-or-pay agreements, we must pay for agreed-upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the facilities.\nOur unconditional purchase commitments have varying expiration dates, with some extending through the remaining life of the respective landfill. Future minimum payments under unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of (1) disposal related agreements, which include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host agreements and take-or-pay and put-or-pay agreements and (2) other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements. As of December 31, 2024, such purchase commitments, which do not qualify for recognition on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, amount to $907 million, of which $202 million was short-term.\nFor additional detail regarding our debt and known contractual and other obligations, see Note 9, \nDebt,\n and Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n51\nTable of Contents\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Liabilities\nWe have future obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure costs with respect to the landfills we own or operate as set forth in applicable landfill permits. As of December 31, 2024, our future obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure costs totaled $2.1 billion, of which $96 million was short-term.\nAdditionally, we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. As of December 31, 2024, our environmental liabilities totaled $447 million, of which $63 million was short-term.\nFor additional detail regarding our asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities, see Note 8, \nLandfill and Environmental Costs\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchases\nIn October 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase authorization effective starting January 1, 2021 and extending through December 31, 2023. In October 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $3 billion share repurchase authorization effective starting January 1, 2024 and extending through December 31, 2026. Share repurchases under the current program may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. While the Board of Directors has approved the program, the timing of any purchases, the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management, at its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining authorized purchase capacity under our October 2023 repurchase program was $2.5 billion.\nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\nThe major components of changes in cash flows for 2024 and 2023 are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars):\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,936 \n$\n3,618 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(2,561)\n$\n(3,667)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n$\n(1,398)\n$\n62 \nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nThe most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2024 and 2023 are summarized below.\nChanges in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures, decreased our cash flow from operations by $378 million in 2024, compared to a decrease of $91 million during the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of the following:\n•\nOur accounts receivable, exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, increased $76 million during 2024, due to the timing of billings net of collections, compared to a $71 million increase in the same period in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, our days sales outstanding were 40.9, or 30.0 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 42.0, or 30.9 days net of deferred revenue, as of December 31, 2023.\n•\nOur prepaid expenses and other assets increased $171 million in 2024 compared to a $30 million increase in 2023. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets during 2024 is primarily driven by an increase in capitalized implementation costs for our cloud-based hosting arrangements and higher insurance premium costs. \n•\nOur accounts payable decreased $27 million during 2024 compared to an $83 million increase during 2023, due to the timing of payments.\n•\nCash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations was $56 million during 2024 compared to $61 million for 2023. The decrease in cash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations is primarily due to the timing of capping and post-closure payments at certain of our landfill sites.\n•\nCash paid for remediation obligations was $7 million higher during 2024 compared to 2023.\n52\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, cash paid for interest was $487 million and $423 million, excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps, for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes was $313 million and $343 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nWe use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt repayments and share repurchases. \nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nThe most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2024 and 2023 are summarized below:\n•\nCapital expenditures during 2024 were $1,855 million as compared to $1,631 million for 2023.\n•\nProceeds from sales of property and equipment during 2024 were $47 million as compared to $29 million for 2023.\n•\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we used $753 million and $2,065 million, respectively, for acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired. During 2024 and 2023, we received $2 million and $6 million from business divestitures, respectively.\nWe intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities and tax-exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to primarily use cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to pay for future acquisitions.\nCash Flows (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nThe most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2024 and 2023 are summarized below:\n•\nDuring 2024, we issued $900 million of senior notes for cash proceeds, net of discounts and fees, of $889 million. During 2023, we issued $2,200 million of senior notes for cash proceeds, net of discounts and fees, of $2,172 million. Net payments of notes payable and long-term debt were $1,089 million during 2024, compared to net payments of $1,190 million in 2023. For a more detailed discussion, see the \nFinancial Condition\n section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n•\nDuring 2024, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock for $480 million. During 2023, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for $262 million. \n•\nIn July 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.580 per share. Dividends paid were $687 million and $638 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n•\nDuring 2024 and 2023, cash paid for purchase price holdback releases and contingent purchase price related to acquisitions was $15 million and $19 million, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nDebt Obligations\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had $862 million of principal debt maturing within the next 12 months, which includes certain finance lease obligations. All of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed either quarterly or semiannually by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield, with the exception of three tax-exempt financings with initial remarketing periods of 10 years. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had availability under our Credit Facility (defined below) to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. In the event of a failed re-borrowing under our commercial paper program, as of \nDecember 31, 2024, \nwe had availability under our Credit Facility to fund the amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program until it is re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these tax-exempt financings and commercial paper program borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n.\nFor further discussion of the components of our overall debt, see Note 9, \nDebt\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n53\nTable of Contents\nCredit Facilities\nUncommitted Credit Facility\nIn January 2022, we entered into a $200 million unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facility (the Uncommitted Credit Facility). The Uncommitted Credit Facility bears interest at an annual percentage rate to be agreed upon by both parties. Borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facility can be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The agreement governing our Uncommitted Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants. The Uncommitted Credit Facility may be terminated by either party at any time. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, \nwe had no borrowings outstanding under our Uncommitted Credit Facility. \nThe Credit Facility\nIn July 2024, we and our subsidiary, USE Canada Holdings, Inc. (the Canadian Borrower) entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility) which amends and restates the unsecured revolving credit facility we entered into in August 2021. The total outstanding principal amount that we may borrow under the Credit Facility may not exceed the current aggregate lenders' commitments of $3.5 billion, and borrowings under the Credit Facility mature in July 2029. As permitted by the Credit Facility, we have the right to request two one-year extensions of the maturity date, but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extensions. The Credit Facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders.\nAll loans to the Canadian Borrower and all loans denominated in Canadian dollars cannot exceed $1 billion (the Canadian Sublimit). The Canadian Sublimit is part of, and not in addition to, the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility in United States dollars bear interest at a Base Rate, a daily floating SOFR or a term SOFR plus a current applicable margin of 0.920% based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the Credit Facility agreement). The Canadian dollar-denominated loans bear interest based on the Canadian Prime Rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus a current applicable margin of 0.920% based on our Debt Ratings. As of December 31, 2024, $232 million was outstanding against the Canadian Sublimit, with an average interest rate of 5.309%. \nThe Credit Facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the Credit Facility agreement and the aggregate commitment, regardless of usage. The Credit Facility can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. We may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants.\nWe had $514 million and $297 million outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had $317 million and $337 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also had $477 million and $495 million of principal borrowings outstanding (net of related discount on issuance) under our commercial paper program as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result, availability under our Credit Facility was $2,192 million and $2,371 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFinancial and Other Covenants\nThe Credit Facility requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. To the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants, we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock. Compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the Credit Facility, and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). Additionally, if we are not in compliance with these covenants, we could not use the availability under our Credit Facility to fund borrowings we currently make under our commercial paper program, if there is a failed reborrowing under that program. The Credit Facility provides that our total debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. In the case of an \"elevated ratio period\", which may be elected by us if one or more acquisitions during a fiscal quarter involve aggregate consideration in excess of $200.0 million (the Trigger Quarter), the total debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 4.25 to 1.00 during the Trigger Quarter and for the three fiscal quarters thereafter. The Credit Facility also provides that there may not be more than two elevated ratio periods during the term of the Credit Facility agreement. As of December 31, 2024, our total debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.6 compared to the 3.75 maximum allowed. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all other covenants unde\nr our Credit Facility\n.\nEBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, is calculated as defined in our Credit Facility agreement. In this context, EBITDA is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to EBITDA used by other companies or used by us for other purposes.\nFailure to comply with the financial and other covenants under the Credit Facility, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the Credit Facility to accelerate the maturity of all \n54\nTable of Contents\nindebtedness under the Credit Facility. This could have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on the Credit Facility constitutes an event of default under certain of our other debt and derivative instruments. If such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under the Credit Facility for relief from the financial covenant or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the Credit Facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn April 29, 2022, we entered into a $1 billion unsecured Term Loan Facility (Term Loan Facility), which bore interest at a base rate or a forward-looking SOFR, plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings. We had $500 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repaid the remaining balance of the Term Loan Facility.\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn May 2022, we entered into a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of unsecured commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500 million outstanding at any one time (the Commercial Paper Cap). In August 2022, the Commercial Paper Cap was increased to $1.0 billion, and in October 2023, was increased to $1.5 billion. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024 was 4.646% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 18 days.\nWe had $477 million and $496 million principal value of commercial paper issued and outstanding under the program as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility (as defined above) to fund amounts currently borrowed under the commercial paper program until they are re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSenior Notes and Debentures\nIn March 2023, we issued $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2029 (the Existing 2029 Notes) and $800 million of 5.000% senior notes due 2034 (the 2034 Notes, and together with the Existing 2029 Notes, the Notes). The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated and rank equally with our other unsecured obligations. We used the proceeds from the Notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Uncommitted Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Program, the Credit Facility, and the Term Loan Facility. As a result of the Term Loan Facility repayment, we incurred a non-cash loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the ratable portion of unamortized deferred issuance costs of less than $1 million.\nIn December 2023, we issued an additional $350 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2029 (the New 2029 Notes, and together with the Existing 2029 Notes, the 2029 Notes). After giving effect to the issuance of the New 2029 Notes, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes is outstanding. The New 2029 Notes are fungible with the Existing 2029 Notes, and taken together, the 2029 Notes are treated as a single series.\nIn December 2023, we also issued $650 million of 5.000% senior notes due 2033 (the 2033 Notes). The proceeds of the 2033 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Uncommitted Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Program, the Credit Facility, and the Term Loan Facility.\nIn June 2024, we issued $400 million of 5.000% senior notes due 2029 and $500 million of 5.200% senior notes due 2034. We used the proceeds from the June 2024 notes issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility; and repayment of the remaining amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the Uncommitted Credit Facility.\nOur senior notes and debentures are general unsecured obligations. Interest is payable semi-annually. \nTax-Exempt Financings\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1,409 million of certain variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding, with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2053. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1,281 million of certain variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding, with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2053. \nFinance Leases and Other\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had finance lease liabilities of $315 million with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2063. As of December 31, 2023, we had finance lease liabilities of $251 million with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2063.\n55\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, finance leases and other included $53 million related to the construction of an office building located in Phoenix, Arizona, which has been accounted for as a financing obligation. The amount is recorded within long-term debt, net of current maturities.\nCredit Ratings\nOur continued access to the debt capital markets and to new financing facilities, as well as our borrowing costs, depend on multiple factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2024, our credit ratings were BBB+, Baa1 and A- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively. If our credit ratings were downgraded, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, our ability to access the debt markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than short-term operating leases and financial assurances, which are not classified as debt. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations. We have not guaranteed any third-party debt.\nSeasonality and Severe Weather\nOur operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction or expansion of our landfills and other facilities. Our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services. \nContingencies\nFor a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 8, \nLandfill and Environmental Costs\n, Note 11, \nIncome Taxes\n and Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial Assurance\nWe must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, or insurance policies (Financial Assurance Instruments), or trust deposits, which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states require a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2025, although the mix of Financial Assurance Instruments may change.\nThese Financial Assurance Instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not classified as indebtedness. Because we currently have no liability for the Financial Assurance Instruments, they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets; however, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred.\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that \n56\nTable of Contents\nwe believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments.\nWe have noted examples of the estimates that are subject to uncertainty in the accounting for these areas below.\nLandfill Development Asset Depletion\nLandfill depletion expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $408 million and $379 million, respectively.\nTo match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per-ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully depleted at the end of a landfill’s operating life. The per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs for the landfill, by the landfill’s estimated remaining permitted and probable disposal capacity. The expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at depletion expense for the period.\nThe calculation of depletion expense includes certain estimates and assumptions around future landfill development costs and remaining permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity. Changes in these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to the following factors: (i) actual future costs of construction materials and third-party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor, and (ii) technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory changes or legislative changes.\nOn at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually. Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill depletion rates that are updated annually. \nLandfill Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and post-closure. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our asset retirement obligations related to capping, closure and post-closure were $2,144 million and $1,937 million, respectively. Changes in these estimates may be sensitive to the following factors: (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations and/or circumstances affecting our operations could result in a significant change to our estimates, which could have a significant impact on our result of operations, (ii) we do not expect to incur most of these costs for a number of years, which requires us to estimate the timing of projected cash flows and make assumptions regarding inflation rates, and (iii) actual future costs of materials and third-party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor. \nObligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post-closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units-of-consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. Landfill amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $106 million and $92 million, respectively. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping, closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections.\nLandfill capping.\n As individual areas within each landfill reach capacity, we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These requirements are detailed in each landfill's technical design, which is reviewed and approved by the regulatory agency issuing the landfill site permit. \nClosure and post-closure.\n Closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste, but prior to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a post-closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post-closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site, the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post-closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, third-party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance and transportation and disposal of leachate.\nLandfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets.\n Estimates of the total future costs required to cap, close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost estimates are inflated to the period of \n57\nTable of Contents\nperformance using an estimated inflation rate, which is updated annually. For 2024, our estimated inflation rate of 2.0% is based on the twenty year average core consumer price index and for 2023, our estimated inflation rate of 2.0% was based on the ten year average consumer price index.\nThe present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post-closure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a per-ton basis. These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill.\nRetirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities. This accretion is charged to operating expenses. Actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made.\nCorresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities. The retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per-ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed. The per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per-ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event. Closure and post-closure per-ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill.\nChanges in these estimates may be sensitive to the following factors: (1) changes to environmental laws and regulations and/or circumstances affecting our operations could result in a significant change to our estimates, which could have a significant impact on our result of operations, (ii) we do not expect to incur most of these costs for a number of years, which requires us to estimate the timing of projected cash flows and make assumptions regarding inflation rates, and (iii) actual future costs of materials and third-party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor. \nOn an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed. \nTotal landfill depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $514 million and $471 million, respectively. See our \nResults of Operations\n section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization. \nEnvironmental Liabilities\nWe are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties. \nWe accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies. We periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. With the exception of those obligations assumed in certain business combinations, environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Environmental obligations assumed in certain business combinations are initially estimated on a discounted basis, and accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis. These adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known. We perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. See our \nResults of Operations\n section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion on our remediation adjustments. We have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies. \n58\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $447 million and $485 million of environmental liabilities, respectively. Changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in cost estimates, timing of estimated costs and settlements, inflation and applicable regulations. Our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events, which may change the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities. Thus, our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified, the financial viability of those parties and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any adjustments could be material.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a description of new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
