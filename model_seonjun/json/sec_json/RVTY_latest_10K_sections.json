As of December 29, 2024, we employed approximately 1,400 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 40 countries and marketing products and services in more than 160 countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.\nRaw Materials, Key Components and Supplies\nEach of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in \n10\nTable of Contents\nspecified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.\n \nIn some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.\n \nCompetition\nDue to the range and diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. Our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.\nWe compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market positions. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.\n \nRegulatory Affairs\nOur operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of our product activities, and if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. \nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products and services to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, as well as other penalties.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. In addition, changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards.  \nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include the handling, transportation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or hazardous substances, the \n11\nTable of Contents\nremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.\nWe may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.\nWe are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $14.2 million and $14.1 million as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.\nWe may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs. \nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 29, 2024, we employed approximately 11,000 employees on a worldwide basis. Roughly 80% of our workforce is based outside of the United States. Several of our subsidiaries outside the United States have employment contracts with our employees where the terms and conditions are influenced by labor unions and workers’ councils’ agreements that involve approximately 4,000 of our employees. During fiscal year 2024, our voluntary turnover rate was approximately 9%. We believe that management of our human capital resources is vital to the continued growth and success of our company, and we endeavor to create an environment that encourages productivity, rewards performance and values employees. There are several ways in which we attempt to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees, as set forth below. \nOur human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, developing, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees. We strive to meet this objective by offering competitive compensation and benefits, in a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. We hold our employees to high performance standards and our compensation plans are designed to deliver competitive base pay and attractive incentive opportunities. Our benefits programs are specifically tailored to the various countries in which we operate and maintain a significant workforce. We benchmark for market practices and adjust our compensation and benefits programs to ensure they remain both equitable and competitive. \nFostering a Positive Workplace Culture \nWe believe in a workplace, where everyone feels valued, respected, and has the opportunity to contribute their unique perspectives and talents. We have employees in roughly 40 countries around the world. \nesg.revvity.com is a home for information related to Environmental, Social, and Governance policies and initiatives at Revvity. The site provides information for our employees, customers and investors on our environmental and social performance, including key metrics and relevant policies. We highlight our global efforts to preserve our environment, support the communities where we operate, and foster a positive workplace. The site showcases our commitment to responsible business practices and how these contribute to long-term value creation for our stakeholders.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe understand that our ability to operate in a multicultural world is critical to our long-term value creation. We strive to create a workplace where everyone feels valued and respected, believing that this fosters innovation and enables all employees to contribute fully to our shared goals. We make employment decisions based on legitimate business needs and in compliance with all applicable laws.\nTraining and Development \nWe are committed to the continued development and training of our employees and we seek to provide them with meaningful learning opportunities to help grow their capabilities and careers. We provide such opportunities across all levels of our organization, covering a variety of professional, technical and leadership topics. We do so through a variety of channels and formats, including formal (classroom-based, blended learning solutions, digital learning) and informal, on-the-job learning. \nA pivotal component of our annual performance review and goal-setting process focuses on providing employees with constructive and actionable feedback, as well as management engagement in the creation and completion of development goals. In addition, employees have access to confidential, anonymous feedback through a process that is used as a development tool to help raise awareness on how they are perceived. Lastly, we recognize that professional development requires support of the whole person, and we therefore offer virtual coaching to help eligible employees meet their unique development goals, whether such goals are leadership or well-being focused. \nWith regards to career growth, we regularly fill open vacancies with internal candidates. Our internal mobility program empowers employees to explore many different career options available to them. Career options vary based on an employee’s aspirations and can include specific project work, stretch assignments, job rotations, mentoring, networking, or internal job changes.\nLastly, management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development. \nHealth and Safety \nOur success depends on the well-being of our employees, and one of our top priorities is to protect their health and safety. We maintain a culture focused on safety and strive to identify, eliminate and control risk in the workplace to prevent injury and illness. Many of our large manufacturing sites are ISO 45001 and 14001 certified with management systems embedded in operations. We continually strive to improve our environmental, health and safety (\n“\nEHS\n”\n) management systems across our entire footprint. A Revvity Global EHS Council\n \nengages our worldwide health and safety leaders to review, collaborate, and drive corporate EHS objectives across the company. Further, we provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance and other resources that support their physical and mental well-being.\nCommunity \nAt Revvity, we have long held the view that responsible global citizenship along with good governance principles and ethical business practices are essential tenets for sustainability and success. We encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and where we operate, and to assist in that effort, we fund a long-term charitable matching program for our employees. In addition, we have established a group comprised of management and subject matter experts at our company to focus on developing and delivering on measurable advancements in the areas of reducing waste, reducing carbon emissions and improving employee engagement.",
  "item7": "Item 7.    \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including the following management’s discussion and analysis, contains forward-looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors above under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A above that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n \nAccounting Period\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53-week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. Each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2024 (“fiscal year 2024”), December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) and January 1, 2023 (“fiscal year 2022”) included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ending December 28, 2025 (“fiscal year 2025”) will include 52 weeks.\n \nOverview of Fiscal Year 2024 \nDuring fiscal year 2024, we again delivered differentiated financial performance despite market headwinds, demonstrating the strength of our product portfolio and innovation. Our overall revenue in fiscal year 2024 increased by $4.5 million, or less than 1%, as compared to fiscal year 2023, reflecting an increase of $42.7 million, or 3%, in Diagnostics segment revenue and a decrease of $38.2 million, or 3%, in Life Sciences segment revenue. The increase in Diagnostics segment revenue was primarily driven by increased demand in our immunodiagnostics and reproductive health businesses, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our applied genomics business. The decrease in Life Sciences segment revenue was driven by a decrease in instruments and reagents revenue due to pharmaceutical and biotechnology market headwinds, partially offset by an increase in software revenue from the timing of contract renewals and new orders.\nOur consolidated gross margin decreased 16 basis points in fiscal year 2024, as compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily due to an unfavorable shift in product mix and higher product costs, partially offset by pricing actions and productivity initiatives. Our consolidated operating margin increased 166 basis points in fiscal year 2024, as compared to fiscal year 2023, due to productivity initiatives and cost containment. \nOverall, we believe that our range of product offerings, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued long-term growth, margin expansion and robust cash flow generation.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n \nFiscal Year 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year 2023\nRevenue\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $2,755.0 million, as compared to $2,750.6 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $4.5 million, or less than 1%. \nThe \nanalysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Life Sciences segment revenue was $1,254.1 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $1,292.3 million for fiscal year 2023, a decrease of $38.2 million, or 3%, driven by a decrease of $47.2 million in instruments revenue and a decrease of $13.5 million in reagents revenue, partially offset by an increase of $22.5 million in software revenue. Diagnostics segment revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1,500.9 million, as compared to $1,458.2 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $42.7 million, or 3%, due to an increase of $43.7 million in immunodiagnostics revenue and an increase of $22.6 million in reproductive health revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $23.7 million in applied genomics revenue. \nAs a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize $0.8 million of revenue for each of the \nfiscal years 2024 and 2023\n that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1,217.4 million, as compared to $1,210.9 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of approximately $6.5 million, or 1%. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased to 44.2% in fiscal year 2024 from 44.0% in fiscal year 2023, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of approximately 16 basis points to 55.8% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.0% in fiscal year 2023 due to an unfavorable shift in product mix and higher product costs, partially offset by pricing actions and productivity initiatives. Rebranding costs were $6.2 million for fiscal year 2024. Stock compensation expense related to awards given to BioLegend employees post-acquisition added an incremental expense of $0.6 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $2.8 million for fiscal year 2023. Amortization of intangible assets was $144.4 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $147.6 million for fiscal year 2023.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2024 were $994.1 million, as compared to $1,022.6 million for fiscal year 2023, a decrease of $28.5 million, or 3%. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 36.1% in fiscal year 2024 from 37.2% in fiscal year 2023. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $215.0 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $217.5 million for fiscal year 2023. Restructuring and other costs, net, decreased and were $17.5 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $26.6 million for fiscal year 2023. Acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, which primarily consisted of legal and integration costs, and stock compensation expense related to the awards given to BioLegend employees post-acquisition, added an incremental expense of $16.3 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $62.0 million for fiscal year 2023. Purchase accounting adjustments decreased expenses by $1.7 million for fiscal year 2024, which primarily consisted of a change in fair value of contingent consideration, as compared to increasing expenses by $4.3 million for fiscal year 2023. Costs for significant environmental matters also added an incremental expense of $2.5 million for fiscal year 2023. The above decreases were partially offset by an increase in asset impairments, which added an incremental expense of $22.8 million for fiscal year 2024. Significant litigation matters and settlements added an incremental expense of $7.8 million for fiscal year 2024 and were minimal for fiscal year 2023. Excluding the factors above, the net decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was the result of productivity initiatives and cost containment.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2024 were $196.8 million, as compared to $216.6 million for fiscal year 2023, a decrease of $19.7 million, or 9%. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 7.1% in fiscal year 2024 from 7.9% in fiscal year 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily driven by productivity initiatives and cost containment, as well as a decrease in stock compensation expense related to awards given to BioLegend employees post-acquisition, which added an incremental expense of $2.2 million in fiscal year 2024, as compared to $4.3 million for fiscal year 2023.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consisted of the following for the fiscal years ended:\n \nDecember 29,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\n \n(In thousands)\nInterest income\n$\n(73,190)\n$\n(72,131)\nInterest expense\n96,278 \n98,813 \nChange in fair value of investments\n(7,958)\n33,921 \nOther components of net periodic pension cost\n8,508 \n19,006 \nForeign exchange losses and other expense, net\n6,977 \n37,977 \nTotal interest and other expense, net\n$\n30,615 \n$\n117,586 \nInterest income increased due to an increase in short-term investments and higher interest rates. \nInterest expense decreased primarily \ndue to lower debt balance as a result of the repayment of senior unsecured notes that matured in September 2023 and September 2024. Change in fair value of investments resulted in income of $8.0 million in fiscal year 2024 as compared to expense of $33.9 million in fiscal year 2023 primarily due to the fluctuation in share price of investments in marketable securities, partially offset by fair value changes in notes receivables and other investments. \nOther components of net periodic pension cost decreased primarily due to increases in applicable discount rates. \nForeign exchange losses and other expense, net, was lower during fiscal year 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a foreign exchange loss of $24.0 million that was recognized in fiscal year 2023 related to the cash proceeds from the sale of the Business \n29\nTable of Contents\nthat were held offs\nhore. \nA more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rates were 10.5% and 1.9% for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal \nstatutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nDecember 29,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\n(In thousands)\nTax at statutory rate\n$\n66,386 \n$\n38,346 \nNon-U.S. rate differential, net\n(13,332)\n(18,479)\nU.S. taxation of multinational operations\n(28,879)\n(4,594)\nState income taxes, net\n2,174 \n(265)\nImpact of rate changes\n— \n(12,795)\nPrior year tax matters\n(9,389)\n3,971 \nEffect of stock compensation\n2,960 \n2,225 \nGeneral business tax credits\n(17,634)\n(4,718)\nTransfer pricing matters\n(2,391)\n(6,725)\nChange in valuation allowance\n29,781 \n6,772 \nEffect of foreign repatriations\n5,329 \n(4,737)\nOther, net\n(1,950)\n4,472 \nTotal\n$\n33,055 \n$\n3,473 \nThe variation in our effective tax rate \nfrom the statutory rate \nfor fiscal year 2024 was primarily the result of general business tax credits of $17.6 million, a prior year true-up related to the tax on foreign earnings of approximately $9.4 million, and favorability in our U.S. taxation of multinational operations of $28.9 million, which were partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance of $29.8 million. \nThe variation in our effective tax rate from the statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was primarily the result of a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority of approximately $15.2 million, a prior year true-up related to the tax on foreign earnings of approximately $7.0 million, and a\n \nbenefit for the state tax rate change on deferred taxes of $12.8 million, which were partially offset by an increase in tax reserves of approximately $33.2 million in respect of unfavorable developments with respect to an uncertain tax position with a foreign tax authority that was partially related to continuing operations.\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, see Item 7, Management\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.\n30\nTable of Contents\nReporting Segment Results\nLife Sciences\n \nFiscal Year 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year 2023\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1,254.1 million, as compared to $1,292.3 million for fiscal year 2023, a decrease of $38.2 million, or 3%\n. The decrease in our Life Sciences segment revenue was driven by a decrease of $47.2 million in instruments revenue and a decrease of $13.5 million in reagents revenue, partially offset by an increase of $22.5 million in software revenue.\nSegment operating income for fiscal year 2024 was $448.0 million, as compared to $489.3 million for fiscal year 2023, a decrease of $41.3 million\n, or 8%. Segment operating margin decreased 214 basis points in fiscal year 2024, as compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily due to lower volume and continued investments in new product development, digital capabilities and growth initiatives, partially offset by pricing actions and productivity initiatives. \nFiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, see Item 7, Management\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.\nDiagnostics\n \nFiscal Year 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year 2023\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1,500.9 million, as compared to $1,458.2 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $42.7 million, or 3%, which includes an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. T\nhe \nincrease\n in our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2024 was due to\n an increase of $43.7 million in immunodiagnostics revenue and an increase of $22.6 million in reproductive health revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $23.7 million in applied genomics revenue.\n Segment operating income for fiscal year 2024 was $372.4 million, as compared to $320.1 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $52.3 million, or 16%. Segment operating margin increased 286 basis points in fiscal year 2024, as compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily due \nto higher v\nolume, productivity initiatives, and cost containment.\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, see Item 7, Management\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn March 13, 2023, we completed the sale (the “Closing”) of certain assets and the equity interests of certain entities constituting our Applied, Food and Enterprise Services businesses (the “Business”) to PerkinElmer Topco, L.P. (formerly known as Polaris Purchaser, L.P.) (the “Purchaser”), a Delaware limited partnership owned by funds managed by affiliates of New Mountain Capital L.L.C. (the “Sponsor”), for an aggregate purchase price of up to \n$2.45 billion\n. We received approximately \n$2.27 billion\n in cash proceeds before transaction costs. At the Closing, we were entitled to an additional \n$75.0 million\n in proceeds payable in installments to commence upon our ceasing the use of the PerkinElmer brand and related trademarks and transferring them to the Purchaser (the “Brand Fee”).\n The discounted value of the $75.0 million\n was measured as $65.2 million and was included in the proceeds at Closing. During the fiscal year 2024, we received $18.8 million of the Brand Fee. We expect to receive the remaining balance of the Brand Fee i\nn installments in\n 2025. In addition, we are entitled to additional consideration of up to\n $150.0 million\n \nthat is contingent on the exit valuation the Sponsor and its affiliated funds receive on a sale or other capital events related to the Business. The fair value of this element of consideration was determined to be \n$15.9 million\n and was included in the proceeds at Closing. \nDuring fiscal year 2024, we received approximately $138.5 million of cash from the Purchaser and recognized a loss of $19.8 million primarily related to post-closing adjustments.\nThe Business is reported for all pe\nriods as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations which are presented as income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations: \n31\nTable of Contents\n \nDecember 29, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nJanuary 1, 2023\n(In thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n— \n$\n176,324 \n$\n1,298,376 \nCost of revenue\n— \n125,219 \n859,330 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n— \n78,613 \n306,032 \nResearch and development expenses\n— \n10,434 \n64,605 \nOperating (loss) income\n— \n(37,942)\n68,409 \nOther (loss) income:\n(Loss) gain on sale\n(25,448)\n811,472 \n— \nOther (expense) income, net\n— \n(49)\n5,195 \nTotal other (loss) income\n(25,448)\n811,423 \n5,195 \n(Loss) income from discontinued operations before income taxes\n(25,448)\n773,481 \n73,604 \n(Benefit from) provision for income tax\n(12,762)\n259,890 \n17,101 \n(Loss) income from discontinued operations\n$\n(12,686)\n$\n513,591 \n$\n56,503 \nThe results of discontinued operations during fiscal year 2023 include the results of the Business through March 13, 2023.

During fiscal year 2023 we recognized $37.1 million of divestiture-related costs incurred after the Closing in gain on sale and $36.0 million of d\nivestiture-related costs incurred prior to Closing in\n \nselling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations.\nFor a discussion of our discontinued operations for fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, see Item 7, Management\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are our internal operations, borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and access to debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock, for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 mo\nnths. The sale of the Business generated approximately \n$2.27 billion\n in cash proceeds. We expect to continue to use these proceeds for a combination of debt retirement, opportunistic share r\nepurchases and continued strategic and value creating acquisitions.\nCash Flows\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year 2023\nOperating Activities.\n Net cash provided by continuing operations was $665.0 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $279.4 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $385.6 million, primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and less cash used to fund working capital during fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2024 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $283.1 million, adjustments for non-cash charges aggregating to $400.2 million, including depreciation and amortization of $427.8 million, and a net cash decrease in working capital of $18.3 million. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2023 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $179.5 million, adjustments for non-cash charges aggregating to $491.2 million, including depreciation and amortization of $431.8 million, and a net cash decrease in working capital of $391.3 million. Contingent consideration payments of $6.1 million during fiscal year 2024 as compared to $0.6 million during fiscal year 2023 were included in cash flows from operating activities.\nInvesting Activities.\n Net cash provided by the investing activities of our continuing operations was $619.3 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to a $761.2 million net cash usage for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $1,380.5 million. During fiscal year 2024, proceeds from maturity of U.S. treasury securities were $710.0 million \nand proceeds from investments and notes receivables were $2.5 million. \nThe cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2024 was partially offset by net \n32\nTable of Contents\ncash used for capital expenditures of $86.6 million, as compared to $81.4 million for fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2024\n, purchases of investments and notes receivables were \n$6.6 million\n, as compared to \n$6.3 million\n \nfor fiscal year 2023\n. \nDuring fiscal year 2023, purchases of investments in U.S. treasury securities amounted to $1.2 billion, and net cash used for acquisitions was $2.1 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from\n maturity of U.S.\n treasury securities\n totaling $550.0 million.\nFinancing Activities.\n Net cash used in financing activities was $1,128.2 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $947.1 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $181.1 million. During fiscal year 2024, we made net payments of $723.1 million on debts, as compared to $517.5 million during fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total cost of $369.6 million, as compared to $388.9 million in fiscal year 2023. We paid $34.5 million in dividends for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $35.0 million in fiscal year 2023. We paid $8.8 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration during fiscal year 2024, as compared to $10.1 million in the prior year period. The cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2024 was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of $7.7 million during fiscal year 2024, as compared to $4.3 million in fiscal year 2023.\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, see Item 7, Management\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.    \nBorrowing Arrangements\nDuring \nfiscal year 2024, we paid in full \n$711.5 million of outstanding 0.850% Senior Unsecured Notes that became due in September 2024 (the \n“\n2024 Notes\n”\n). During \nfiscal year 2024, we received proceeds of $710.0 million upon the maturity of all our outstanding U.S. Treasury securities and utilized those proceeds to partially repay the outstanding 2024 Notes. In addition, o\nn January 7, 2025, our prior senior unsecured revolving credit facility was cancelled and replaced with a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five-year term and a borrowing capacity of \n$1.5 billion\n available through January 7, 2030. \nSee Note 12, \nDebt,\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our borrowing arrangements. \nDividends\nOur Board of Directors (our “Board”) declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. At December 29, 2024, we had accrued $8.6 million \nfor a dividend declared in October 2024 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 that was paid in February 2025. On January 23, 2025, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 that will be payable in May 2025. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conser\nve capital resources.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe project an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2025 relative to fiscal year 2024. This planned increase reflects our strategic commitment to enhancing our digital capabilities, product innovations, and realigning our production infrastructure. We anticipate funding these initiatives through a combination of our existing cash reserves and internally generated funds from our continuing operations, ensuring a prudent approach to financial management while pursuing these critical growth and optimization strategies.\n \nOther Potential Liquidity Considerations\nAt December 29, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,163.4 million, of which $562.6 million was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we had $1.5 billion of borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. \nWe use a variety of cash redeployment and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is neede\nd. We recorded the applicable taxes associated with the future remittance of undistributed foreign earnings previously taxed at the U.S. federal level and/or that would be claimed for a dividend received deduction if repatriated. \n33\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the sale of the Business, we expect to receive the remaining balance related to the Brand Fee of $56.3 million as of December 29, 2024, in installments through fiscal year 2025.\nOn April 27, 2023, our Board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $600.0 million under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On October 24, 2024, the Repurchase Program was terminated by our Board and our Board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $1.0 billion under a new stock repurchase program (the “New Repurchase Program”). No shares remain available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program due to its termination. The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 23, 2026, unless terminated earlier by our Board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 1,820,296 shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of $213.6 million. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 1,238,755 shares of common stock under the New Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of $142.8 million. As of December 29, 2024, $857.2 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the New Repurchase Program. \nIf we continue to repurchase shares, the New Repurchase Program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash \nequivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 29, 2024, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $75.9 million. As of December 29, 2024, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $21.8 million, of which $4.3 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $17.4 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. The maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods is 6.9 years from December 29, 2024, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at December 29, 2024 was 4.3 years.\nWe and our subsidiaries may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness.\nPrincipal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:\n•\nchanges in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and\n•\nchanges in our working capital requirements and capital expenditures.\nPrincipal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:\n•\nfinancial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,\n•\nincreases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,\n•\na ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,\n•\nincreases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,\n•\na decrease in the market price for our common stock, and\n•\nvolatility in the public debt and equity markets.\nEffects of Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, \nNature of Operations and Accounting Policies,\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements. We adopted \nAccounting Standards Update 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n (“ASU 2023-07”)\n during fiscal year 2024 and \nhave included the additional disclosures related to the reportable segments in Note 21, \nIndustry Segment and Geographic Area Information, \nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n.\n We are in the process of determining the impact of the recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted in our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nDivestitures:\n As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have disposed of or sold certain businesses. In accounting for such transactions, we apply the applicable accounting guidance under U.S. GAAP pertaining to discontinued operations and disposals of components of an entity. When the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements, we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. We recognize divestiture-related costs that are not part of divestiture consideration as general and administrative expense as they are incurred. These costs typically include transaction and disposal costs, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees. \nThe accounting for divestiture requires estimates and judgment as to the determination of the gain or loss on sale and the fair value of the different elements of consideration received. We received cash proceeds of \n$2.27 billion\n and we are entitled to two elements of additional consideration that become payable upon the resolution of certain events. First, we are entitled to proceeds of $75.0 million as consideration for our ceasing the use of the PerkinElmer brand and related trademarks and transferring them to the Purchaser (“Brand Sale”). During the fiscal year 2024, we received $18.8 million of the Brand Fee. The remaining consideration is expected to be received in installments through fiscal year 2025. We are also entitled to proceeds of up to $150.0 million that is contingent on the proceeds that the Purchaser and its affiliates receive on a subsequent sale or other capital event related to the Business (“Contingent Gain”). \nThe recognition of the future payment related to the Brand Sale and Contingent Gain to the gain on sale and the fair value assigned to the Contingent Gain, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. In deriving the fair value of the Contingent Gain, we utilized a lattice model, which incorporates one or more of the following key assumptions: (1) simulated equity value from the valuation date through the expected liquidity event, (2) volatility based on guideline public companies, (3) expected term to a liquidity event, and (4) risk-free rates. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in the recognition of additional consideration which would increase the gain on sale or impairment of the receivable from the Purchaser. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results from continuing operations for the period.\nGoodwill:\n We periodically review the carrying value of our goodwill, based, in part, upon current estimates of fair values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (i) on an annual basis, and (ii) on a periodic basis when facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. \nThe goodwill impairment test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we voluntarily changed \nour annual goodwill impairment testing date from the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year to the later of November 1 or the first day of our eleventh fiscal month of each fiscal year. We changed the measurement date to more closely align the annual impairment testing date with the most current information from the budgeting and strategic planning process. We believe the change in goodwill impairment testing date does not represent a material change to our method of applying the accounting principle in light of our internal controls and requirements to assess goodwill impairment upon certain triggering events. This change was applied prospectively and therefore, we performed our annual impairment testing for our reporting units for fiscal year 2024 as of January 1, 2024 and November 1, 2024. We have identified six reporting units and consistently emplo\ny the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. We corroborate the income approach with a market approach.\nA number of significant estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to arrive at forecasted cash flows. Cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and on our long-range plan in later years. The income approach is sensitive to changes in revenue growth rates and the discount rates. \nAs of the November 1, 2024 impairment testing, the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the respective carrying value of each reporting unit with the exception of the Life Sciences reporting unit. The Life Sciences reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $4,332.5 million at December 29, 2024, had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by more than 10% but less than 20% as of the November 1, 2024 impairment testing date. While we believe that our estimates used in measuring fair value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used, including estimates of future revenue growth and volatility in discount rate, impairment charges may be incurred in the future.  \n     \nPost-retirement \nbenefits:\n We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefits. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and \n35\nTable of Contents\nrepresent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.\nWe recognized total costs of $9.3 million in fiscal year 2024 and $20.2 million in fiscal year 2023, for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, which include the charge for the mark-to-market adjustment for the benefit plans. The loss related to the mark-to-market adjustment on benefit plans was \n$1.0 million in fiscal year 2024 and $9.9 million in fiscal year 2023. \nIt is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in fiscal year 2025. Mark-to-market adjustments are often driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, but primarily relate to changes in interest rates and actual return on investments on plan assets. To the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our plan assets decrease, mark-to market losses will be recognized. Conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our plan assets increase more than expected, mark-to market gains will be recognized. \nIf the discount rate used to measure the pension obligations were to change as of December 29, 2024, our pension plan expenses would also change as follows:\nIncrease (Decrease) at \nDecember 29, 2024\nPercentage Point Change\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nPension plans discount rate\n+0.25\n$(5,986)\n$(1,686)\n-0.25\n6,280\n1,747",
