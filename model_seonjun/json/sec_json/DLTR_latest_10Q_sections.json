Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any securities analyst regardless of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, we have a policy against confirming projections, forecasts or opinions issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not our responsibility.\nOverview\nWe are a leading operator of more than 9,200 retail discount stores, as of November 1, 2025, offering merchandise predominantly at the opening price point of $1.25, with additional offerings at higher price points.\nOur net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores. Second is the performance of stores once they are open which can be impacted by a number of factors including operational performance, competition, inflation, consumer buying preference and changes in the product assortment, pricing, or quality. Sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. We include sales from stores expanded, relocated or remodeled during the period in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. Stores that were converted from Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the Dollar Tree brand. Additionally, sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable store net sales are referred to as non-comparable store sales and consist of sales from new stores open fifteen months or less and stores that are closed permanently or expected to be closed for more than 90 days.\nOn July 5, 2025, the Company completed its previously announced sale of the Family Dollar business to 1959 Holdings, LLC, for a purchase consideration of $1,007.5 million, subject to certain adjustments, including with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. Net proceeds from the sale consisted of $665 million paid at closing and $22 million to be received post-closing, subject to final adjustment under the terms of the purchase agreement, dated as of March 25, 2025. In addition, the Company monetized approximately $113 million of cash from Family Dollar prior to the closing date primarily through a reduction of net working capital. Together, the total cash monetized from the sale of the Family Dollar business approximates $800 million. As of November 1, 2025, the remaining receivable for estimated net proceeds to be received totaled $14.7 million. The results of Family Dollar are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Income Statements for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of Family Dollar have been reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for all prior periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts, percentages and discussions below reflect only the results of operations and financial condition of our continuing operations. Refer to “Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments” below and \nNote 10\n to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on discontinued operations. \n21\nTable of Contents\nQuarterly Results\nFinancial highlights for the 13 weeks ended November 1, 2025, as compared to the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, include:\n•\nNet sales increased 9.4% to $4,746.3 million due to a 4.2% comparable store net sales increase and net sales of $351.7 million at non-comparable stores.\n•\nGross profit increased 10.8% to $1,700.5 million primarily due to our net store growth. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased 40 basis points to 35.8%.\n•\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 140 basis points to 29.2%. \n•\nTransition services agreement income, net was $23.8 million resulting from services provided to Family Dollar following the sale.\n•\nOperating income, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased 40 basis points to 7.2%.\n•\nThe effective tax rate was 23.9%, an increase of 70 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter.\n•\nIncome from continuing operations was $244.6 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $232.3 million, or $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.\nStore Activity & Selected Sales Data\nAt November 1, 2025, we operated stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as stores in five Canadian provinces. The average size of stores opened during the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2025 was approximately 9,230 selling square feet. A breakdown of the changes in store count and square footage is as follows:\n39 Weeks Ended\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nStore Count:\nBeginning\n8,881 \n8,415 \nNew stores\n360 \n492 \nStores converted from Family Dollar\n71 \n8 \nClosings\n(43)\n(47)\nEnding\n9,269 \n8,868 \nRelocations\n8 \n21 \nSelling Square Feet (in millions):\nBeginning\n78.4 \n73.1 \nNew stores\n3.3 \n5.4 \nStores converted from Family Dollar\n1.1 \n0.1 \nClosings\n(0.3)\n(0.3)\nEnding\n82.5 \n78.3 \nThe store counts above do not include new stores until they are opened for sales. Similarly, stores converted from a Family Dollar store to a Dollar Tree store are reflected in the table above when they re-opened as a Dollar Tree store.\nThe percentage change in comparable store net sales, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nSales Growth\n4.2%\n1.8%\n5.4%\n1.6%\nChange in Customer Traffic\n(0.3)%\n1.5%\n1.8%\n1.9%\nChange in Average Ticket\n4.5%\n0.3%\n3.6%\n(0.3)%\n22\nTable of Contents\nComparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded, relocated and remodeled stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores.\nNet sales per selling square foot is calculated based on total net sales for the preceding 12 months as of the end of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period. Selling square footage excludes the storage, receiving and office space that generally occupies approximately 20% of the total square footage of our stores. We believe that net sales per selling square foot more accurately depicts the productivity and operating performance of our stores as it reflects the portion of our footprint that is dedicated to selling merchandise. Net sales per selling square foot for the 52 weeks ended November 1, 2025 and November 2, 2024 is as follows:\n52 Weeks Ended\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNet sales per selling square foot\n$236\n$233\nSee our “Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments” below for more information on the initiatives that are driving our comparable store net sales growth and net sales per selling square foot growth. \nStrategic Initiatives and Recent Developments\nWe continue to execute on a number of strategic initiatives across our business to drive profitable growth for Dollar Tree as a standalone banner following the sale of Family Dollar. During our Investor Day on October 15, 2025, we outlined our operational strategy for the years ahead, including an expanded, more relevant assortment, agile cost management, a more connected customer experience in stores, new store growth, and improved store conditions and operations, supported by an evolving supply chain and disciplined financial management. Some of these initiatives and other recent developments, in no particular order, include the following.\nMerchandising\n. In addition to our $1.25 price point, we continue to expand our multi-price offerings to provide a broader, more relevant assortment and differentiated value to our customers. As of November 1, 2025, we carried this multi-price assortment in more than 5,000 of our stores. In August 2025, we announced a new nationwide partnership with Uber to bring the Uber Eats platform to nearly 9,000 Dollar Tree stores, offering customers on-demand access to and delivery of value-driven essentials, snacks, party supplies and seasonal surprises.\nCost Management. \nWe are actively implementing mitigation strategies to offset the impact of cost pressures and inflation, including tariffs, by re-negotiating supplier terms, re-engineering products for efficiency, shifting country of origin where it adds advantage, discontinuing lower-margin or underperforming items and executing targeted retail price changes. We believe our mitigation strategies will allow us to protect our margins and maintain our competitiveness over the long term and, most importantly, keep providing our customers with the value, convenience, and discovery they expect for the products they need to help live and celebrate their lives. In addition, our long-term strategy includes a disciplined approach to managing our selling, general and administrative expenses to drive operating leverage and profitability. \nDuring fiscal 2025, we have experienced increased costs associated with the tariff environment and implementation of our mitigation strategies, including discrete price-change costs. We expect our results to continue to be impacted by near-term challenges, including higher costs due to the volatility in the tariff environment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Additionally, implementation costs associated with our mitigation strategies may continue to be experienced before the benefits from those efforts are expected to materialize. The ultimate impact of cost inflation, including tariffs and other related measures, remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, the overall magnitude and duration of these measures, and the costs and effectiveness of, and consumer response to, our mitigation efforts.\nOur Workforce\n. We are investing in our talent, including initiatives to provide competitive pay and benefits, enhanced training, and attractive career opportunities to deliver an enhanced associate experience, reduce turnover, and improve our store standards and efficiencies and ultimately the customer experience. \nStore Growth and Improved Conditions. \nOur strategy includes continued new store growth, as well as improved store conditions and operations to deliver a consistent experience for our associates and customers, provide a stronger customer connection and drive profitable growth. These initiatives include projects to optimize and modernize our stores, with a focus on increasing shelf space productivity, improving the in-store experience through refresh and renovation programs and customer service enhancements. \nSupply Chain Optimization\n. Our supply chain initiatives include expanding and enhancing our distribution network, improving our transportation and inventory management capabilities and upgrading our warehouse management systems. Investments are also \n23\nTable of Contents\nunderway for enhancements in automation in existing buildings to improve efficiency. These investments are expected to negatively impact gross margin in the near-to-mid term. \nIn April 2025, we announced that we will be returning to Marietta, Oklahoma with a new, enhanced distribution center that is expected to be fully operational by spring 2027 with the capacity to serve 700 stores across the West and Southwest regions of the country. We broke ground on the new Marietta distribution center in September 2025. In October 2025, we announced that we purchased a 1.25 million square foot distribution center outside of Phoenix, Arizona, which we expect to open in spring 2026. This new distribution center will strengthen our supply chain in the Southwest, servicing stores in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.\nTechnology Investment\n. We continue our multi-year plan for significant investment in our technology across our business, including our mobile app, human capital management system and supply chain system. We believe these improvements can promote operational efficiencies and deliver an elevated customer experience.\nFamily Dollar Strategic Alternatives Review\n. On March 25, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to 1959 Holdings, LLC, and on July 5, 2025, we completed the sale for a purchase consideration of $1,007.5 million, subject to certain adjustments, including with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. Net proceeds from the sale consisted of $665 million paid at closing and $22 million to be received post-closing, subject to final adjustment under the terms of the purchase agreement. In addition, the Company monetized approximately $113 million of cash from Family Dollar prior to the closing date primarily through a reduction of net working capital. Together, the total cash monetized from the sale of the Family Dollar business approximates $800 million. As of November 1, 2025, the remaining receivable for estimated net proceeds to be received totaled $14.7 million. The Company has continuing involvement with Family Dollar under a transition services agreement, through which the Company and Family Dollar continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of 18 months following the date of sale. For information on discontinued operations, refer to \nNote 10\n to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations and period-over-period changes are discussed in the following section. Note that the cost of sales rate is calculated by dividing cost of sales by net sales. Gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit (i.e., net sales less cost of sales) divided by net sales. The selling, general and administrative expense rate and operating income margin are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue. Basis points, as referred to below, are a percentage of net sales for expense categories within gross profit and cost of sales, and are a percentage of total revenue for all other expense categories. A 100 basis point increase equals 1.00% and a 1 basis point increase equals 0.01%. \n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following table contains results of operations data for the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 1, 2025 and November 2, 2024:\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\n(in millions, except percentages)\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nRevenues\nNet sales\n$\n4,746.3 \n$\n4,338.0 \n$\n13,949.6 \n$\n12,569.1 \nOther revenue\n4.7 \n3.2 \n11.5 \n9.6 \nTotal revenue\n4,751.0 \n4,341.2 \n13,961.1 \n12,578.7 \nExpenses & other operating items\nCost of sales\n3,045.8 \n2,803.9 \n9,029.5 \n8,167.2 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n1,385.7 \n1,206.6 \n4,005.0 \n3,483.1 \nTransition services agreement income, net\n23.8 \n— \n31.8 \n— \nOperating income\n343.3 \n330.7 \n958.4 \n928.4 \nInterest expense, net\n21.9 \n28.3 \n67.4 \n84.9 \nOther (income) expense, net\n0.1 \n0.1 \n(62.0)\n0.2 \nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes\n321.3 \n302.3 \n953.0 \n843.3 \nProvision for income taxes\n76.7 \n70.0 \n239.4 \n201.0 \nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n244.6 \n$\n232.3 \n$\n713.6 \n$\n642.3 \nGross profit margin\n35.8 \n%\n35.4 \n%\n35.3 \n%\n35.0 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expense rate\n29.2 \n%\n27.8 \n%\n28.7 \n%\n27.7 \n%\nOperating income margin\n7.2 \n%\n7.6 \n%\n6.9 \n%\n7.4 \n%\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of total revenue\n6.8 \n%\n7.0 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n6.7 \n%\nEffective tax rate\n23.9 \n%\n23.2 \n%\n25.1 \n%\n23.8 \n%\nIncome from continuing operations as a percentage of total revenue\n5.1 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n5.1 \n%\n5.1 \n%\nNet Sales\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\n(dollars in millions)\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nPercentage Change\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nPercentage Change\nNet sales\n$\n4,746.3 \n$\n4,338.0 \n9.4 \n%\n$\n13,949.6 \n$\n12,569.1 \n11.0 \n%\nComparable store net sales change\n4.2 \n%\n1.8 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nThe increase in net sales in the 13 weeks ended November 1, 2025 was a result of the comparable store net sales increase and net sales of $351.7 million at non-comparable stores.

weeks ended November 1, 2025 compared to 23.2% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase in expected state taxes, partially offset by a decrease in non-deductible compensation.\nThe effective tax rate increased to 25.1% for the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2025 compared to 23.8% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase in expected state taxes and reduced benefits from the vesting of share-based payment awards, partially offset by a decrease in non-deductible compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe invest capital to build and open new stores, expand and renovate existing stores, enhance and grow our distribution network, operate our existing stores, maintain and upgrade our technology, and support our other strategic initiatives. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of September and October. We have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing and new stores and have funded our distribution network programs and other capital projects from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe following table compares our cash flows for the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2025 and November 2, 2024:\n \n39 Weeks Ended\n(in millions)\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities of continuing operations\n$\n958.5 \n$\n1,335.8 \nInvesting activities of continuing operations\n(393.0)\n(961.5)\nFinancing activities of continuing operations\n(1,703.5)\n(412.9)\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $377.3 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable in the current year compared to an increase in the prior year, partially offset by inventory levels increasing at a lower rate compared to the prior year, and higher income from continuing operations. \nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $568.5 primarily due to $672.0 million of net proceeds received for the sale of Family Dollar, and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by $246.0 million of cash divested from the sale of Family Dollar.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $1,290.6 million primarily due to the repayment of our $1.0 billion principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes due May 15, 2025, and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by increased borrowings under our commercial paper program.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\") was enacted in the U.S. The most significant impacts to the Company of the OBBBA are the immediate expensing of domestic research and development expenditures and the permanent reinstatement of bonus depreciation for qualifying properties. The Company expects the impact will defer the payment of approximately $100.0 million of current federal income taxes.\nIn connection with the sale of Family Dollar, completed on July 5, 2025, the Company expects to realize cash tax benefits from losses on the sale totaling approximately $425.0 million, subject to final adjustment under the terms of the purchase agreement. \nAt November 1, 2025, our long-term borrowings were $2.45 billion. Additionally, we had $1.5 billion available under our new Five-Year Credit Facility and $1.0 billion available under our 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to \nNote 4\n to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the new Five-Year Credit Facility and 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility. We have a commercial paper program which as of November 1, 2025 allowed us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. On May 15, 2025, we leveraged our commercial paper program, in addition to utilizing available cash, to redeem our $1.0 billion principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes. As of November 1, 2025, $620.0 million principal amount of notes were outstanding under the commercial paper program. Additionally, we have $85.0 million in trade letters of credit with various financial institutions, under which $3.1 million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise as of November 1, 2025.\nOur credit facilities serve as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes outstanding under the commercial paper program. On November 10, 2025, we increased the size of our commercial paper program to permit the issuance of commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.5 billion, compared to the previous maximum permitted of $1.5 billion. The $2.5 billion maximum is authorized through the maturity date of our 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility on March 20, 2026 or such later date to which the maturity of the 364-Day Facility or a similar replacement financing arrangement is extended, and will return to $1.5 billion thereafter. \nWe repurchased 15,007,491 and 3,283,837 shares of common stock on the open market at a cost of $1.3 billion and $403.6 million, including applicable excise tax, during the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2025 and November 2, 2024, respectively. Of the shares repurchased during the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2025, $12.8 million settled subsequent to November 1, 2025 and these amounts were accrued in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In July 2025, our Board of Directors replenished the Company’s share repurchase authorization to an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion, reflecting the limit previously approved by the Board in September 2021. At November 1, 2025, we had $2.0 billion remaining under the $2.5 billion Board repurchase authorization.\nSubsequent to November 1, 2025, we purchased an additional 1,711,878 shares of common stock on the open market at a cost of $176.0 million, as of December 1, 2025.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates.\nFor a summary of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates, refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025."
