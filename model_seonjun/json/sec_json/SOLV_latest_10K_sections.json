Our R&D capabilities include R&D organizations that operate within each of our business segments, as well as R&D capabilities spanning across our business segments.\nOur business segment R&D organizations are responsible for the full product development life cycle, leveraging industry insights, domain-specific expertise in end-to-end product development, and a detailed understanding of customer applications \n6\nTable of\n \nContents\nand usability to innovate in both new and marketed products. Our cross-segment capabilities include building new shared technologies and advancing existing shared technologies. We believe that collaboration across our organization further enhances our R&D capabilities by encouraging the sharing of best practices, enabling collaborative development and issue resolution, promoting synergies in development and manufacturing, and creating a broad culture of exploration.\nOur R&D team consists of approximately 2,000 employees, including research scientists, chemical engineers, data scientists, software engineers, application development engineers and product developers. They are supported by a team of accomplished clinicians from our medical affairs group. We partner with our medical affairs group to enhance our clinical insight and expand awareness of clinical studies regarding our solutions by increasing both the number of peer-reviewed publications and the visibility for existing publications that address our solutions.\nIntellectual Property\nDevelopment and protection of our proprietary technologies through IP rights is a strategic priority for our business. To protect our proprietary technologies, Solventum relies on a combination of patent, design, utility model, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protections as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and confidentiality agreements. Our IP team collaborates with our R&D and product teams to develop product line focused IP strategies and secure IP rights as appropriate. We generally file patent applications in the United States and foreign countries that have strong technology patent protections. We also license from third parties IP that complements our internal R&D efforts and product offerings. While, in aggregate, our patents and other IP are vital to our operations, we do not consider any single IP asset or group of assets to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole; rather, we believe understanding our customers’ needs, technology expertise, and manufacturing know-how are critical for our business.\nCompetitors\nWe operate in highly competitive markets across our segments and product categories throughout the world. Our ability to compete effectively is contingent upon several factors, including but not limited to our ability to deliver differentiated clinical and economic outcomes for our customers.\nIn the MedSurg segment, our advanced wound care market is highly competitive, particularly in the United States and Europe, with our principal competitors including Smith & Nephew, Medela, Mölnlycke, Coloplast, and Convatec. Our infection prevention and surgical supplies solutions are offered in highly competitive and fragmented end markets, especially in the United States and Europe. Our principal competitors in this segment include Becton Dickinson, Hartmann, ICU Medical, Medline, Cardinal Health, Fortive, Steris, MDF Instruments, and BSN. \nThe dental market is highly competitive, with players ranging from very large broad-based multinational companies to localized or specialized suppliers and start-ups. Principal multinational competitors within the oral care market include Dentsply Sirona, Envista, and Straumann, all of which compete with both dental and orthodontic solutions, and Ivoclar, which competes with only dental solution offerings, and Align Technology, which competes with only orthodontic solution offerings. \nThe health care software technology market in which we conduct our business, and the healthcare information technology (“HCIT\n”\n) industry in general, is highly competitive and dynamic, characterized by the continual introduction of new products and technologies. Principal competitors include Optum, Microsoft (Nuance), Epic, Cerner, Athena, and a host of start-up technologies actively working to disrupt the areas of revenue cycle management and clinician productivity. In the United States, the market for value-based care software solutions is highly fragmented and subject to continuous entry of new competitors. The market is even more fragmented internationally. Outside the U.S., we compete primarily with local players in the respective country or region, in addition to new market entrants. \nThe Purification and Filtration segment competes against a diverse spectrum of competitors. Established global filtration competitors such as Danaher, Merck KGaA, Sartorius, Pentair, Repligen, and Entegris compete on a variety of factors across product lines, including breadth of offering, product performance, customer service, product availability, distribution capabilities, innovation, name recognition and price. \nHuman Capital\nWe have a long-tenured and diverse talent base with significant work experience, technical qualifications, and healthcare industry expertise. Our employee base consists of approximately 22,000 employees, with approximately 40% having more than 10 years of tenure. We have approximately 11,000 employees in the United States and approximately 2,600 in Germany. Of our employees, approximately 5,200 are production employees working in plants across the globe. We have approximately 80 employees who are represented by a union in the U.S., all of whom are in one manufacturing facility and are covered by a three-year collective bargaining agreement that expires on November 1, 2027. Our relationship with employee-representative \n7\nTable of\n \nContents\norganizations outside the U.S. takes many forms, including in European Union countries where we engage with representative bodies for employees, such as employee forums, works councils and trade unions, in accordance with local law.\nOur employees are united in our mission to provide better, smarter, safer healthcare to improve lives.  Our culture highlights collaboration and teamwork, along with a focus on empathy, solving challenges and improving care.\nThe ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate our global workforce will be a key driver of our success. Our key human capital priorities are designed to support those efforts, including those listed below.\n•\nHealth and Safety\n: Solventum is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. We continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and company policies; and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on our sites. We also promote health and well-being through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive healthcare benefits.\n•\nDevelopment and Pipeline\n: We have a robust, continuous talent review process focused on succession planning and key talent development. We deploy functional and leadership development opportunities and support time to learn. In addition, we advance our talent pipeline by attracting competitive talent and accelerating leadership and key skill development. We are expanding our external talent pools and leveraging university and professional organizations to identify talent with critical skills.\n•\n \nWorkplace Environment\n: Our ability to evolve as a highly preferred organization who serves the needs of our employees and contributes to customer success is realized by enabling a workplace and environment which fosters belonging. In support of the communities we operate in globally, we are committed to inclusion in its broadest sense. We strengthen our commitment by ensuring accessible and fair processes for all. Whether we are attracting or advancing talent, we focus on conveying our intent for leaders and employees to thrive. Engaging talent such as those who are involved in our Employee Resource Networks, which are open to everyone, has proven to be a way to empower and inspire our workforce as they drive innovation in unique ways.\n•\nCompensation and Benefits\n: Our total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition, we have a professional and flexible work environment that promotes innovation and well-being and rewards performance. \nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety Matters\nWe are subject to various laws, regulations, ordinances, customer requirements, and industry standards related to environment, health, and safety (\n“\nEHS\n”\n) matters. These include, but are not limited to, permitting, licensing, and authorization requirements, and regulatory obligations. These laws, regulations, ordinances, requirements and standards affect a significant portion of our activities globally across each of our segments and product lines and require compliance related to, among other things: (a) occupational health, safety, and well-being; (b) the protection of the environment; (c) emissions and discharges to air and water; (d) greenhouse gas management and climate change; (e) the use of natural resources; (f) the handling, use, storage, transportation, and disposal of toxic or hazardous materials, radioactive materials, and solid and hazardous wastes; and (g) the procurement and use of select materials and chemicals. EHS laws and regulations also vary widely by jurisdiction, may be established at supranational, international, national, state, and/or local levels, and are constantly evolving, often to become more stringent. \nCompliance with EHS laws, regulations, customer requirements, and industry standards requires, among other things, that we maintain and operate our equipment safely; obtain and keep current environmental permits, radioactive material licenses, and radiation machine registrations; install pollution control technologies; and maintain certain records and submit specific reports. Failure to comply could lead to enforcement actions, such as the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties; the suspension or termination of our permits, licenses, authorizations, or operations; claims by third parties; remediation expenses or liabilities; or other sanctions. \nSolventum also is subject to extensive and evolving regulations regarding the manufacturing, processing, distribution, importing, exporting, and labeling of its products and their raw materials. In the European Union, for instance, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations came into effect in 2007, with implementation rolling out over time. Registered chemicals then can be subject to further evaluation and potential restrictions. Since the promulgation of REACH, other countries have enacted or are in the process of implementing similar comprehensive chemical regulations.\n8\nTable of\n \nContents\nSome of Solventum’s products utilize third-party purchased components that contain PFAS. Use is critically evaluated on an on-going basis, and non-PFAS alternatives are utilized, when possible. Regulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. These regulatory activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions and in water, soil and air, in some cases moving towards setting non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds.  Governments, including in the United States, are also increasingly proposing changes to existing environmental regulations to specifically apply to PFAS.  In February 2023, the European Chemicals Agency published a proposal under REACH, which has not yet been finalized, that aims to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market and use of PFAS, subject to certain exceptions. \nSolventum’s operations are also subject to regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA\n”\n) and parallel state and local occupational health and safety standards, as well as occupational health and safety standards applicable to its operations in other jurisdictions. These standards establish certain employer responsibilities, including requirements to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause serious injury or death, certain medical and hygiene standards, licensing and permitting obligations and various recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Solventum’s facilities and operations may be subject to periodic inspections by OSHA representatives and comparable authorities in other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with applicable occupational health and safety standards, even if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, could result in civil or criminal enforcement and substantial penalties, significant capital expenditures or suspension or limitation of Solventum’s operations.\nIn addition to REACH and OSHA, Solventum manufacturing facilities are also subject to additional environmental, health and safety statutes, regulations and permit requirements, including, but not limited to, applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Seveso-III Directive (Directive 2012/18/EU), the European Machinery Directive (Directive 2006/42/EC), the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (Directive 2010/75/EU), and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register.\nSales and Marketing\nWe have an extensive global commercial footprint with sales in over 90 countries. To serve our diverse customer base across our prioritized geographies, we take a multi-model commercial approach, including direct-to-customer, distribution, key account management, inside sales, and e-commerce. We augment our commercial model with both marketing and service support. Key marketing activities include brand management, insights, price management, digital marketing, and integrated marketing communications. As our customers increasingly leverage both traditional and digital media in their path to purchase, we continue to optimize our own omnichannel execution to ensure the best customer experience possible. Our service support teams include clinical specialists (licensed nurses or technicians), medical liaisons (clinical professionals such as surgeons and dentists), and application engineers (technical subject matter experts). These teams provide high-quality customer support serving as the clinical and/or technical expert for the customer. \nTo expand our market coverage into emerging geographies in the Latin America (\"LATAM\"), Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and Asia regions, we employ an export commercial model and leverage local partners to market and sell our products. Our local third-party partners facilitate regulatory and cross-border import compliance and distribute directly to the customer. Our export commercial team provides technical, clinical, and marketing support both directly to our customers as well as to our third-party partners, to help increase customer satisfaction and support our ability to grow our global presence.\nGlobal Supply Chain and Sourcing\nOur sourcing, production, and distribution network is managed globally. We believe we have advanced manufacturing and assembly production capabilities across our global manufacturing network. Our manufacturing is supported by a global distribution network. \nOur distribution network is strategically designed as a “hub and spoke” model. \nThis approach optimizes route planning and increases the speed of deliveries to our customers in all regions. In addition, our distribution network footprint meets the needs of our customers in a cost-effective model.\nAs we separate from 3M, we continue to leverage 3M's distribution networks and manufacturing sites across certain geographies. The use of both distribution network and manufacturing sites are covered under a Transition and Distribution Agreement and a Transition Contract Manufacturing Agreement, respectively, with 3M.\nOur supply chain resiliency program consisting of regional sources of supply, dual-source manufacturing capabilities and vertically integrated operations presents a competitive advantage by providing a reliable supply of products to our customers.\n9\nTable of\n \nContents\nRegulations\nGeneral \nThe regulations applicable to Solventum are promulgated and enforced by government bodies in individual countries and govern the methods and controls used for the design, manufacture, packaging labeling, storage, safety, sales and distribution, marketing clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sterilization, installation, servicing, performance and effectiveness of the products Solventum sells globally. These regulations apply to all facilities of Solventum’s business that conduct the foregoing activities, regardless of where the facilities are located. These regulations apply to the activities performed by most of Solventum’s employees, including but not limited to sales and marketing, research and development, regulatory affairs, quality assurance, medical affairs, and operations, both before and after a product is commercially distributed. These regulations differ by country and/or region and are dynamic. \nSolventum commits a significant amount of resources to maintain compliance with these regulations. Compliance with these regulations requires Solventum to create systems, processes, and procedures that are aligned with the regulations in all markets Solventum serves. Compliance also requires Solventum to maintain knowledge of the current regulations that govern its activities. As these regulations change, Solventum must adapt its systems, processes, and procedures to comply with the new regulations. \nGoverning bodies monitor compliance, among other ways, by conducting regularly occurring and unexpected audits of Solventum’s facilities. These audits are conducted to determine if Solventum’s systems, processes, and procedures comply with the current regulations in the markets it serves. After each audit, the governing body typically provides a report of their findings. The report describes the observations made during the audit. Sometimes these observations describe minor non-compliance issues in Solventum’s systems, processes, and procedures. Often, these gaps require commensurate modifications but have no impact to Solventum’s ability to continue operations and commercialization of its products. In rare situations, the governing body may find significant or major non-compliance issues in Solventum’s systems, processes, and procedures. If a governing body concludes, through these audits or otherwise, that Solventum is not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of its products are defective, ineffective, or pose an unreasonable risk for patients, users, or others, the governing body may require Solventum to recall a product or products, retract promotional materials, and/or cease shipment of products, among other required actions; these requirements may remain in place until Solventum can demonstrate adequate compliance. Failure to demonstrate adequate modifications to Solventum’s systems, processes, and procedures and continued compliance or repeat findings may result in more significant enforcement actions, including but not limited to warning letters, revocation of product approvals and licenses, injunctions, product seizure, penalties and fines, consent decrees, and criminal prosecution, among other actions. These actions may have a negative impact on Solventum’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or competitive position. \nAs discussed in more detail below under “Regulation of Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical Products,” to market its products internationally in compliance with applicable medical device and pharmaceutical regulations, Solventum must obtain approvals for products and product modifications. The regulations promulgated by the governing bodies also require Solventum to submit data to demonstrate that its products meet the safety and effectiveness requirements to support the intended uses described in its labeling. This data is reviewed by the governing bodies to determine if Solventum has provided the necessary and sufficient information to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of its products for the intended use described in its labeling. In many cases, the governing bodies request additional information to make this determination. The additional information requested by the governing bodies sometimes requires Solventum to conduct new testing, delaying the approval and commercialization of the product. In rare instances, the governing body will disapprove the application, prohibiting Solventum’s ability to commercialize the product in that market. In these instances, Solventum may decide to cease commercialization efforts for the product in that (or those) market(s) or it may decide to modify the product or retest the products and resubmit the data to the governing bodies. Delays to product approvals or disapproval of Solventum’s applications may have a negative impact on Solventum’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or competitive position.\nFailure to establish, follow or comply with any of the above requirements could have a negative impact on Solventum’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or competitive position. \nThis global regulatory environment will likely continue to evolve, which could impact Solventum’s ability, or increase the time and cost, to obtain future approvals for its products. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and/or approvals to market and sell Solventum’s products can be rigorous, costly and time-consuming and the clearances and/or approvals might not be granted timely or result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. \n10\nTable of\n \nContents\nRegulation of Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical Products\nThe products Solventum develops, manufactures, and commercializes are regulated in most of the markets Solventum serves. Some of these products meet the definition of medical devices or pharmaceuticals and are regulated, as such, by various governmental bodies, globally. All products produced by the MedSurg and Dental Solutions segments, with very few exceptions, meet the definition of a medical device or pharmaceutical product. Accordingly, the development, manufacture, and commercialization of these products must comply with the regulations governing medical devices or pharmaceuticals in the markets we serve. Conversely, none of the products produced by the Health Information Systems and Purification and Filtration segments meet the definition of medical devices or pharmaceuticals. The product portfolio of each segment is dynamic and changes with time, depending on the needs of the customers served. While the Health Information Systems and Purification and Filtration segments do not currently include medical devices or pharmaceutical products, this may change in the future. \nDeterminations of the safety and efficacy of our products are solely within the authority of the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.\nAdditionally, 3M™ Promogran™ Collagen Dressing and 3M™ Tegaderm™ CHG Chlorhexidine Gluconate IV Securement Dressing, which are products of the MedSurg segment, are regulated by the FDA’s Center for Device and Radiological Health as a combination product category.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDA”) authorizes the FDA to oversee and regulate the production, sale, and distribution of food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics. \nMedical Devices\nSolventum’s medical devices are regulated by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes depending on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness: Class I (Low Risk), Class II (Moderate Risk), and Class III (High Risk). \n•\nClass I: Class I medical devices are those where the General Controls for Medical Devices are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.\n•\nClass II: Class II medical devices are where the General Controls for Medical Devices alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish special controls, including the promulgation of performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines, recommendations, and other appropriate actions as the FDA Commissioner deems necessary to provide such assurance.\n•\nClass III: Class III medical devices are intended to be used in supporting or sustaining human life or preventing impairment of human health, or that may present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury for which the General Controls for Medical Devices and special controls are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device, or for which there is insufficient information to make such a determination. Class III devices typically require pre-market approval. \nMost medical devices are cleared by FDA through the \nPre-Market Notification, or 510(k), process. This process requires medical device manufacturers \nto \ndemonstrate that their devices are as safe and effective as (i.e., substantially equivalent to) a legally marketed medical device. Pre-market notifications are required for most Class II and some Class I medical devices. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA has determined that these devices require a Pre-market approval (a “PMA”). A PMA application is the most stringent type of marketing application required by the FDA. Typically, PMA submissions require the submission of human clinical trials to achieve FDA approval. Currently, none of the medical devices in Solventum’s portfolio of products are Class III medical devices in the United States. \nPharmaceutical Products\nSolventum’s pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Generally, drugs are brought to the market through the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process or an Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Monograph. Solventum’s pharmaceutical products are brought to market through the NDA and OTC pathways. \nThe NDA process typically begins with the completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, which may need to be performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices regulations, followed by the submission to \n11\nTable of\n \nContents\nthe FDA of an investigational new drug application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually. \nBefore each clinical study may be initiated, an independent Institutional Review Board or ethics committee representing each clinical site must approve such study. The clinical studies must be adequate, well-controlled and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements.\n \nAfter the completion of the clinical trials, an \nNDA is submitted to the FDA to demonstrate that a drug is safe and effective in its proposed use(s), the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks, the drug’s proposed labeling (package insert) is appropriate, and the methods used to manufacture the drug are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Following the completion of the clinical trials, the NDA process with the FDA generally involves the following:\n•\npreparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA;\n•\npotential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;\n•\na determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;\n•\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product drug substance and drug product are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Processes (“cGMP”), and audits of selected clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP; and\n•\nFDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.\nA\nn OTC drug monograph is a type of “recipe book” covering acceptable ingredients, doses, formulations, labeling, and, in some cases, testing parameters. OTC drug monographs are continually updated to add additional ingredients and labeling as needed. Products conforming to a monograph may be marketed without FDA pre-approval. Under the OTC monograph system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of an NDA. The FDA OTC monographs include well-known ingredients and specific requirements for permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels. Pharmaceutical products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula and labeling requirements. Facilities where OTC drugs are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored or distributed must comply with cGMP regulations and/or regulations promulgated by the FDA or other competent authorities. OTC monograph products that do not comply with these standards can be deemed unapproved new drugs and can be required to be withdrawn from the market. The Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act, enacted in March 2020, is expected to introduce significant reform to the OTC monograph system, including by replacing the FDA’s existing rulemaking process with an administrative order process for issuing, revising and amending OTC monographs.\nEuropean Union\nMedical Devices\nAll medical devices that are placed on the market or put into service in the European Union must meet the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation. Manufacturers must demonstrate compliance to the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation, prior to affixing the CE Mark on the products and commercializing in the European Union. A CE Mark is a symbol placed on a product that declares that the product is compliant with the essential requirements of applicable health, safety and environmental protection regulation. Compliance to the Medical Device Regulation requires a manufacturer to \ndemonstrate that its products comply with minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality, through a conformity assessment procedure that depends on the product’s classification. The \nMedical Device Regulation\n describes four classes of medical devices: Class I (Lowest Risk), Class IIa, Class IIb, and Class III (Highest Risk). Classification is dependent on a variety of factors, including duration of use, whether the device is invasive or non-invasive, and whether the device is considered “active.” Notified bodies are responsible for ensuring that manufacturers comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation. All medical devices in Solventum’s current portfolio are regulated as medical devices in the European Union. \nPharmaceutical Products\nThe European Medicines Agency is responsible for regulating pharmaceutical products in the European Union. The European Medicines Agency implements a system similar to the U.S. FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and it is responsible for evaluating the quality, safety, and efficacy of drug products in the EU. If the European Medical Agency concludes that all requirements for efficacy, safety and quality are met, it issues a positive opinion that is forwarded to the European Commission and the European Commission makes the final decision on the granting of a marketing authorization. \n12\nTable of\n \nContents\nChina \nThe chief pharmaceutical product and medical device regulator in China is the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”), which enforces medical device and pharmaceutical product laws and regulations and standards and has the power to issue fines, seize products, withdraw or suspend an approval or a registration for serious non-compliances, and refer cases for criminal prosecution. These national laws and regulations are also supplemented by provincial and other local-level rules and enforcement policies.\nMedical Devices\nLocally manufactured medical devices gain market authorization through municipal authorities, while medical devices that are not manufactured in China are reviewed by the NMPA and must be accompanied by appropriate documentation showing that the device has been approved in its country of origin. \nMedical devices are classified into three classes: Class I (Lowest Risk), Class II, and Class III (Highest Risk). Approved products are subject to post-market requirements for reporting adverse events and recalls, as well as regular risk assessments of devices and potentially re-evaluation reports of the safety and effectiveness of the device based on more significant safety signals.\nIn addition to product licenses, manufacturing and distribution facilities that handle Class II and III devices require licenses or notifications and must comply with cGMP requirements and good supply practices. The NMPA regularly conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities in China (as part of a pre-market submission review, routine or for-cause inspections, or unannounced inspections) as well as periodic inspections of overseas manufacturers for compliance with China medical device cGMP requirements. The NMPA inspects distributors and user facilities and conducts annual national and provincial sampling inspections and testing to ensure compliance with labeling, licensing, mandatory standards, and other related requirements. In addition, the NMPA conducts regular and for-cause good clinical practice audits of clinical sites that provide data and clinical trial reports for product registration.\nPharmaceutical Products\nSolventum’s pharmaceutical products are strictly regulated by the NMPA and various provincial, city, and county regulators. Some of Solventum’s pharmaceutical products require pre-market approval from the NMPA before they can be marketed in China, and those marketing applications must be supported by clinical data, which typically comes from a multi-phase study in China or by relying on clinical data generated abroad that meets the NMPA’s requirements.\nRegulation on Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion\nThe advertising, marketing, and promotion of Solventum’s products must be truthful and non-misleading, consistent with applicable regulatory clearances and approvals, and supported by adequate and reasonable scientific data. Solventum typically is required to have a reasonable basis to support any factual marketing claims, and what constitutes a reasonable basis for substantiation can vary widely from market to market and from product to product. \nWith limited exceptions, Solventum may not market, promote, or sell regulated products prior to regulatory authority clearance or approval. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, strictly regulate the indications for use and associated promotional safety and effectiveness claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. If regulatory authorities determine that Solventum has promoted or marketed a product for off-label use, including through external-facing materials, oral statements, or physician training, Solventum could be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties. \nIn addition, the National Advertising Division (“NAD”) of the Better Business Bureau administers a self-regulatory program of the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising. NAD monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competitors and consumers. Solventum may also be subject to various state consumer protection laws, including California’s Proposition 65, which requires a specific warning on any product that contains a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.\nSolventum must also comply with advertising, marketing, and promotion rules in all countries in which it markets its products\n.\n In the European Union, advertising of products is subject both to general consumer advertising requirements pursuant to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC), which imposes a general prohibition on misleading and aggressive advertising, as well as more specific regulations in respect of various product classifications. For example, pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC, advertisements of Solventum’s OTC products must, among other requirements, (1) make clear that the message is an advertisement and that the product is clearly identified as a medicinal product, (2) not refer to claims of \n13\nTable of\n \nContents\nrecovery in improper, alarming or misleading terms and (3) not suggest that the effects of taking the medicine are guaranteed, are unaccompanied by adverse reactions or are better than, or equivalent to, those of another treatment or medicinal product. \nIn China, advertisements of OTC products must, among other requirements, include an “OTC” marking and must not contain difficult or confusing medical or pharmaceutical terms that could mislead the public about a product’s efficacy or safety.\nA failure to comply with these regulations could expose Solventum to legal liability, such as enforcement actions, investigations by a governmental authority, civil fines or criminal actions, lawsuits brought by competitors or company whistleblowers, or other actions. \nData Privacy Laws\nSolventum is also subject to extensive laws and regulations protecting the privacy, security, and integrity of personal information, including patient medical information, that it receives, including, among others, the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, (the “HIPAA”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), and similar U.S. state laws, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “E.U. GDPR”), the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK DPA”) and the General Data Protection Regulation (the “U.K. GDPR”), and China’s Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), and Personal Data Cross Border Transfer Rule (“CBDT”). Federal health information privacy laws, such as HIPAA, and consumer protection laws impose requirements for the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of health-related and other sensitive and personal information, and failure to comply may result, such as with respect to any CCPA violations, in civil penalties. The CCPA has been amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which came into effect, in most material respects, on January 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The E.U. GDPR and the U.K. GDPR and UK DPA, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the E.U. Member States and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, store, transfer and otherwise process personal data, including health data and adverse event reporting. The E.U. GDPR contemplates fines for certain violations of up to four percent of global annual revenue or €20 million (or GBP 17.5 million under the U.K. GDPR), whichever is greater, and enforcement can include limits on data transfers to countries outside the E.U. or U.K. In China, Solventum is subject to PIPL, which applies to the secure processing of personal information of natural persons within China, and Solventum is also subject to CBDT for the processing of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products and services within China and the analysis or assessment of the activities of individuals within China. Consequences of non-compliance may include monetary fines of up to five percent of the previous year’s revenue, termination of data transfers and personal liability imposed on those directly responsible. Solventum is also subject to similar privacy and data protection frameworks in other developed and emerging markets. While Solventum utilizes industry standard processes, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the “NIST”) privacy framework and third-party management processes, to assess the potential impact of emerging laws and enforcement trends on its business and to mitigate potential impacts on its business, data privacy laws and regulations and their scope and enforcement are constantly evolving, and Solventum cannot predict what effect, if any, changes to these laws and regulations and Solventum’s compliance with them may have on its business. \nGlobal Healthcare Compliance\nThe marketing, promotion, and sale of medical devices, drugs, and services is regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and equivalent U.S. state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of the delivery of healthcare items and services. These include laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals, and healthcare fraud and abuse. Similar regulations are imposed at the state level, as well as in many global markets in which we do business. \nThe U.S. FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies from promising to pay money or anything of value to any foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to many of Solventum’s customer interactions, as healthcare professionals in other countries are or are often considered government officials, and in some cases lay out specific requirements of how to comply or demonstrate compliance with the legal requirements. Failure to comply with these laws may expose Solventum to monetary fines and penalties, criminal and civil enforcement actions and reputational damage. \nQuality and Safety\nThe FDA and comparable authorities in other jurisdictions regulate the facilities and operational procedures that Solventum uses to manufacture its products. Solventum is required to register its facilities with these authorities. Solventum’s products are required to be manufactured in facilities that operate in accordance with current cGMPs. Compliance with cGMPs requires Solventum to establish and follow quality systems that are designed to ensure that its products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. The scope of cGMP includes, but is not limited to, production and process controls, document \n14\nTable of\n \nContents\ncontrols, acceptance activities, labeling and packing controls, handling, storage, distribution, and installation activities, among others. The FDA and comparable authorities in other jurisdictions periodically inspect Solventum’s manufacturing facilities for compliance with cGMP or similar manufacturing standards in the applicable country. Failure to comply with cGMPs could disrupt Solventum’s ability to manufacture or supply its products.\nSolventum is also required to establish and follow quality systems to comply with certain post-market surveillance requirements, specifically those pertaining to adverse event reporting for medical devices and pharmaceuticals. For medical devices, Solventum is required to report deaths and serious injuries that a device may have caused or to which a device may have contributed. Solventum is also required to report certain device malfunctions. For pharmaceuticals, Solventum is required to report any undesirable event that is associated with the use of a drug or biological product in humans whether or not the events are considered to be product related. For both medical devices and pharmaceuticals, Solventum is required to establish and implement quality systems to comply with regulations pertaining to post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, many of Solventum’s products are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) under the Consumer Product Safety Act and other laws enforced by the CPSC. These statutes and related regulations establish safety standards and bans for consumer products. The CPSC monitors compliance of consumer products under its jurisdiction through market surveillance and has the authority to conduct product safety inspections of establishments where consumer products are manufactured, held or transported. The CPSC can require the recall of noncompliant products or products containing a defect that creates a substantial risk of injury to the public, and the CPSC may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. CPSC regulations also require manufacturers of consumer products to report to the CPSC certain types of information regarding products that fail to comply with applicable regulations, contain a defect that could create a substantial product hazard or create an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. Certain state laws also address the safety of consumer products and may mandate reporting or labeling requirements.\nPricing\nSolventum’s activities are subject to a variety of price control laws, regulations and government mandates in some of the markets in which it operates. In certain markets the pricing for certain Solventum’s products may be subject to prior approval, including in jurisdictions where Solventum’s products are subject to government reimbursement, whereas in other markets Solventum may be able to set its own prices for its products subject to certain degrees of monitoring and control by the applicable governmental authority. \nThese price control mechanisms, and mechanisms in other markets, including long-term price commitments as the result of market dynamics, may restrict the amount Solventum is able to charge for its products, which may reduce its profits and otherwise adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, price control laws, regulations or government mandates may be enacted or become more stringent during times of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions, such as during times of economic slowdown, recession or inflation.\nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety Laws \nSolventum is subject to a broad range of federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning environmental, health and safety matters. For a discussion of these laws and regulations, see the section titled “Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters.” \n15\nTable of\n \nContents\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nBelow is a list of the executive officers of the Company and other significant employees who are members of our leadership team.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Solventum for the years ended December 31, 2024  and 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in “Risk Factors.” See \n“\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\n”\n \nAll amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add up due to the use of rounded numbers.\n42\nTable of\n \nContents\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references to “Solventum” and the “Company” refer to (i) 3M’s Health Care Business prior to the Spin-Off as a carve-out business of 3M and (ii) Solventum Corporation and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off.\nTransition to Standalone Company\nSolventum utilized allocations and carve-out methodologies through the date of the Spin-Off to prepare combined financial statements. The consolidated financial statements herein for periods prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance, do not necessarily include the actual expenses that would have been incurred, and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, standalone company during the historical periods presented.\nIn particular, Solventum benefited from 3M’s long operating history, reputation and well-known brand. Following the separation, Solventum is operating under its own brand, and accordingly may be negatively impacted due to the loss of benefits conferred by 3M’s brand recognition and reputation. In addition, the debt obligations incurred by Solventum in connection with the separation will adversely affect its profitability and could affect its ability to use its cash flow for investing in the business, strategic transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, and returning capital. See Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies - \nOrganization and Description of Business\n and \nBasis of Presentation\n” to the consolidated financial statements and Part 1, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Solventum’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. Solventum’s MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nPerformance by Business Segment\n•\nGeographic Area Supplemental Information\n•\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n•\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n•\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\n•\nFinancial Instruments\nOverview\nSolventum is a leading global healthcare company developing, manufacturing, and commercializing a broad portfolio of solutions that leverages deep material science, data science, and digital capabilities to address critical customer and patient needs. We constantly seek to enable the improvement of standards of care and move healthcare forward with innovation powered by insights, clinical intelligence, technology, and manufacturing expertise. Our 70+ year history of discovering and innovating advanced solutions has helped us solve our customers’ toughest challenges and become a trusted partner.\nOperating Segments and Sales Change Information\nSolventum manages its operations in four business segments: MedSurg, Dental Solutions, Health Information Systems, and Purification and Filtration. \nReferences are made to organic sales change, which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Other, as comprised in the tables below, includes acquisition and divestiture-related activities. Acquisitions include non-health care related supply agreements that conveyed from 3M to the Company at Spin-Off and sales from new supply agreements with 3M that commenced at Spin-Off. Divestiture impacts include lost sales from the Company’s dental anesthetics business that was sold in August 2023 as well as lost sales from certain health care businesses retained by 3M India in connection with the Spin-Off. Solventum believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nSales and operating income by business segment:\nThe following tables contain sales and operating results by business segment for all periods presented. The Company’s use of the term “NM” reflects results considered not material due to not having material activity in comparable prior years.

Organic growth decline in Purification and Filtration was partially offset by organic growth in MedSurg and Dental Solutions.\nManaging currency risks\nPrior to April 1, 2024, Solventum indirectly participated in 3M’s centrally managed hedging program, which utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also used financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, Solventum established its own hedging program. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative worldwide impact on sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. Solventum estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $23 million in 2024. \n45\nTable of\n \nContents\nFinancial condition\nRefer to the section entitled \n“\n—Financial Condition and Liquidity\n”\n below for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nRefer to the preceding \n“\n—Overview\n”\n section and the \n“\n—Performance by Business Segment\n”\n section later in MD&A for discussion of sales change.\nCosts of Sales\nYear ended Year ended December 31,\n(Percent of corresponding net sales)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\nCost of product\n50.0 \n%\n48.0 \n%\n46.9 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n1.1 \n%\nCost of software and rentals\n25.7 \n25.3 \n26.3 \n0.4 \n(1.0)\nCosts of Product\nCosts of product includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.\nCosts of product, measured as a percent of sales of product, increased in 2024 when compared to 2023. The increase was driven by increased costs due to the impact of higher costs on inventory sourced under the master supply and transition manufacturing agreements with 3M and due to the cost of other transition support provided by 3M.\nCosts of product, measured as a percent of sales of product, increased in 2023 when compared to 2022. Material and labor inflation, partially offset by benefits from both price and logistics costs, drove an increase of 0.7%. The material and labor inflation was primarily driven by a 1.4% impact from a higher cost of inventory produced in 2022 but sold in 2023. \nCosts of Software and Rentals\nCosts of software and rentals includes compensation-related costs associated with installation, training and maintenance for our software products, and depreciation, maintenance and refurbishment costs and freight costs related to our hardware rental units.\nCosts of software and rentals, measured as a percent of sales of software and rentals, increased in 2024 as compared to 2023. This increase was driven by higher compensation costs. \nCosts of software and rentals, measured as a percent of sales of software and rentals, decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to product mix from higher software sales.\nOperating Expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n(Percent of total net sales)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A)\n33.7 \n%\n27.4 \n%\n27.5 \n%\n6.3 \n%\n(0.1)\n%\nResearch and development (R&D)\n9.4 \n9.2 \n9.4 \n0.2 \n(0.2)\nOperating Income\n12.6 \n20.6 \n20.8 \n(8.0)\n(0.2)\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSG&A, measured as a percent of total net sales, increased in 2024 when compared to 2023.

This decrease was driven by the impact of the gain related to the sale of the Company’s dental local anesthetic business of 0.7%, partially offset by higher expense due to restructuring charges of 0.5%.\n46\nTable of\n \nContents\nResearch and Development\nR&D, measured as a percent of total net sales, increased slightly in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to initial stand-up costs.

Interest expense, net increased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to interest incurred on the February 2024 issuance of senior notes and March 2024 draw on the senior term loan credit facilities. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. This increase was partially offset by interest earned from cash and marketable securities held during the period. There was no material activity in the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nOther expense (income), net includes the non-service component of periodic pension cost, investment gains and losses, and currency-related impacts from foreign currency translation. Other expense (income), net increased in 2024 as compared to 2023 resulting from charges associated with the substantial liquidation of foreign operations completed as part of our separation from 3M in addition to foreign currency impacts and investment losses.\nOther expense (income), net increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to investment losses and higher foreign currency transaction losses.\nProvision (benefit) for Income Taxes:\nYear ended December 31,\n(Percent of pre-tax income/loss)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEffective tax rate \n20.9 \n%\n19.3 \n%\n20.6 \n%\nRefer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.\nPerformance by Business Segment\nNote 17 to the consolidated financial statements provides an overview of Solventum’s business segments in addition to disclosures relating to Solventum’s segments. We manage our operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are MedSurg, Dental Solutions, Health Information Systems, and Purification and Filtration. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates segment operating performance using net sales and business segment operating income. \nCorporate and Unallocated\nCertain items are maintained at the corporate level and not allocated to the segments (\"Corporate and Unallocated\"). Prior to Spin-Off, Corporate and Unallocated primarily included amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring and related charges, and benefits or costs related to capitalized manufacturing variances. Corporate and Unallocated also includes Spin-Off and separation related costs. Spin-Off and separation related costs include any costs incurred as part of our separation from 3M and costs to setup operations as a standalone company, including system implementations, manufacturing relocations, legal entity separations, certain equity awards granted as part of the Spin-Off, profit mark-ups on transition service arrangements with 3M and other one-time costs.\nCorporate and Unallocated also includes sales and cost of sales related to our supply agreements with 3M and other supply agreements assumed by the Company at Spin-Off related to legacy 3M businesses. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nOperating Business Segments\nInformation related to the Company’s segments is presented in the tables that follow with additional context in the corresponding narrative below the tables. \n47\nTable of\n \nContents\nMedSurg (56.2% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 )\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales (millions) \n$\n4,637\n$\n4,632\n$\n4,585\nIncrease/(decrease)\nOrganic\n1.2 \n %\n1.6 \n%\n2.7 \n%\nOther\n(0.5)\n— \n— \nCurrency Impact\n(0.6)\n(0.6)\n(3.7)\nTotal\n0.1 \n %\n1.0 \n%\n(1.0 \n%)\nBusiness segment operating income (millions)\n$\n887\n$\n1,107\n$\n1,061\nPercent change\n(19.9)\n%\n4.3 \n%\n(13.5 \n%)\nPercent of sales\n19.1 \n%\n23.9 %\n23.1 %\nYear 2024 results:\nSales in MedSurg were up 0.1%:\n•\nOrganic sales growth of 1.2% was driven by volumes, primarily due to benefits from medical OEM products, I.V. site management, and single-use negative pressure wound therapy, partially offset by declines in traditional negative pressure wound therapy and sterilization assurance products.\n•\nOther includes lost sales from certain health care businesses retained by 3M India in connection with the Spin-Off.\n•\nForeign currency translation negatively impacted sales by (0.6%).\nBusiness segment operating income margin decreased when compared to the same period last year.

Capital spending is discussed in more detail below in the section entitled “—Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nThe Company considers the items below to be critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. \nLegal Proceedings\nAssessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, \nContingencies\n. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) for additional information about such estimates.\nGoodwill\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. The Company's reporting units correspond to a business segment as this represents the lowest level of discrete financial information below sales that is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. The Company also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. A discounted cash flow analysis involves key assumptions including projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty. The Company did not perform a discounted cash flow analysis for any reporting unit for any period presented, as the market approach analysis resulted in sufficient headroom between the fair value and the carrying value for each of the Company's reporting units. \nAs of December 31, 2024, goodwill totaled approximately $6.4 billion. The Company has four reporting units, with the MedSurg reporting unit accounting for approximately 56 percent of the goodwill. Based on the annual tests in the fourth quarter of 2024, 2023, and 2022, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the Company's reporting units. Further, there were no events or changes in circumstances during the year ended December 31, 2024 that would indicate the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be impaired. The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nThe strength and stability of Solventum’s operating model and strong free cash flow capability provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Historically, Solventum generated positive operating cash flows and a majority of such cash flows were transferred to 3M as part of 3M’s cash pooling arrangements, the effect of which is presented as Net transfers to 3M in our consolidated financial statements. \n51\nTable of\n \nContents\nUpon completion of the Spin-Off, Solventum has ceased participation in 3M's cash pooling arrangement and our cash and cash equivalents are held and used solely for our own operations. As a result, the Company's capital structure, long-term commitments and sources of liquidity have changed significantly. \nDebt and Credit Facilities \nOn February 16, 2024, the Company entered into a five-year $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in 2029, an 18-month senior unsecured term loan facility of $500 million and a three-year senior unsecured term loan facility of $1.0 billion (collectively, the \n“\nFacilities\n”\n). In March 2024, the Company withdrew $1.48 billion under the Facilities. The funds from the Facilities were transferred to 3M as partial consideration for the Spin-Off.\nOn February 27, 2024, Solventum issued $6.9 billion of Senior Notes in preparation for the payment of partial consideration to 3M in connection with the Spin-Off. \nIn August 2024, the Company prepaid $200 million of the outstanding principal amount from the 18-month senior unsecured term loan credit facility. In December 2024, the Company prepaid an additional $100 million of the outstanding principal amount from the same facility.\nThe Company also had  approximately $40 million in bank guarantees, surety bonds, and other similar instruments issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities. \nRefer to Note 8 of the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nCommercial Paper\nOn March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a commercial paper program that allows it to issue up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of short-term notes to finance short-term liabilities. Any such issuance will mature within 364 days from date of issue. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \nAs of December 31, 2024, Solventum had $762 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $611 million was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $151 million was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2023, Solventum had $194 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $150 million was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and $44 million was held in the United States. There were immaterial amounts of marketable securities at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023 resulted from both cash retained by the Company at Spin-Off and operating cash flow generated by the Company subsequent to the Spin-Off.\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude the effect of exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nYear ended December 31,\n(Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet income\n$\n479 \n$\n1,346 \n$\n1,343 \nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities\nDepreciation and amortization \n555 \n561 \n578 \nPostretirement benefit plan expense\n34 \n41 \n64 \nStock-based compensation expense \n112 \n39 \n37 \nGain on business divestitures\n— \n(56)\n— \nDeferred income taxes \n(155)\n(142)\n(141)\nChanges in assets and liabilities \nAccounts receivable \n43 \n(129)\n(32)\nDue from related parties\n233 \n— \n— \nInventories \n(132)\n23 \n(82)\nAccounts payable \n266 \n105 \n25 \nDue to related parties\n(565)\n— \n— \nAll other operating activities\n315 \n127 \n(113)\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n$\n1,185 \n$\n1,915 \n1,679 \nIn 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased compared to 2023 primarily due to lower net income. Cash flow activity with 3M is reflected in the due from and due to related parties. This activity includes settlement of payables and receivables transferred at Spin-Off related to operating transactions between 3M and Solventum entities that occurred prior to the Spin-Off and transactions under the transition agreements with 3M.\nIn 2023, cash flows provided by operating activities increased compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in inventories, increases in accounts payable, and higher year over year accrued compensation, partially offset by increases in accounts receivables. The lower cash outflows from inventory was driven by supply chain stabilization.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: \nYear ended December 31,\n(Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment \n$\n(380)\n$\n(290)\n(251)\nProceeds from sale of business\n—\n \n60 \n— \nOther — net \n—\n \n— \n(2)\nNet cash used in investing activities \n$\n(380)\n$\n(230)\n(253)\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment increased in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase is primarily driven by additional separation related capital spending as the Company relocates manufacturing and source of supply from 3M. In addition, the Company is focused on investments to support growth, renewal and maintenance programs, and environmental health services.\nOverall property, plant and equipment spending increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 as the Company continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Proceeds from sale of businesses include the sale of assets associated with the Company’s dental local anesthetic business.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities: \nYear ended December 31,\n(Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nRepayment of debt\n$\n(300)\n$\n— \n— \nNet transfers to 3M\n(8,251)\n(1,553)\n(1,456)\nProceeds from long-term debt, net of issuance costs\n8,303 \n— \nOther — net \n8 \n1 \n(4)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities \n$\n(240)\n$\n(1,552)\n(1,460)\nProceeds from long-term debt of $8.3 billion were related to the first quarter issuance of $6.9 billion in senior notes and $1.5 billion in senior term loan credit facilities. The proceeds from these financing transactions were transferred to 3M in connection with the Spin-Off transaction, other than the amounts retained in order to achieve the $600 million retained cash target.  The Company repaid $300 million outstanding principle issued under the senior term loan credit facilities.   \nFinancing cash outflows increased in 2023 due to higher net transfers to 3M.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations:\nSolventum’s material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to the following, for which information on both a short-term and long-term basis is provided in the indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements:\n•\nTax obligations—Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n•\nDebt—Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n•\nCommitments and contingencies—Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. \n•\nOperating leases—Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSolventum purchases the majority of its materials and services as needed, with no unconditional commitments. In limited circumstances, in the normal course of business, the Company enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors that may take the form of, for example, take or pay contracts in which the Company guarantees payment to ensure availability of certain materials or services or to ensure ongoing efforts on capital projects. The Company expects to receive underlying materials or services for these purchase obligations. To the extent the limited amount of these purchase obligations fluctuates, it largely trends with normal-course changes in regular operating activities. Additionally, contractual capital commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses cross currency swaps\n \nas hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, interest rate locks or other hedging instruments.\n \nRefer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, and interest rates risk and commodity prices risk.",
