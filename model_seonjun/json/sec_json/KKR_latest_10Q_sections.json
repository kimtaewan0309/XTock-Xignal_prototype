MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report and our Annual Report, including the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained therein. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\" and \"Business Environment\" in this report and our Annual Report and \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report, and our other filings with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report are hereafter referred to as the \"financial statements.\" Additionally, the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition are referred to herein as the \"consolidated statements of financial condition\"; the condensed consolidated statements of operations are referred to herein as the \"consolidated statements of operations\"; the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) are referred to herein as the \"consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)\"; the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity are referred to herein as the \"consolidated statements of changes in equity\"; and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows are referred to herein as the \"consolidated statements of cash flows.\"\nOverview\nWe are a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management as well as capital markets and insurance solutions. We aim to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and supporting growth in our portfolio companies and communities. We sponsor funds that invest in private equity, credit, and real assets and have strategic partners that manage hedge funds. Our insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life, and reinsurance products under the management of Global Atlantic.\nOur asset management business offers a broad range of investment management services to fund investors around the world. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 810 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $820 billion as of September 30, 2025. Since the inception of our firm in 1976, we have expanded our investment strategies and product offerings from traditional private equity to areas such as leveraged credit, alternative credit, infrastructure, energy, real estate, growth equity (including technology, health care, and impact strategies), and core private equity. We also provide capital markets services for our firm, our portfolio companies, and third parties. Our balance sheet provides a significant source of capital for the growth and expansion of our business, which has allowed us to further align our interests with those of our investment vehicle investors. Building on these efforts and leveraging our industry expertise and intellectual capital have allowed us to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source.\nOur insurance business is operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary Global Atlantic, which is a leading retirement and life insurance company that provides a broad suite of protection, legacy and savings products, and reinsurance solutions to clients across individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic primarily offers individuals fixed-rate annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, and targeted life products through a network of banks, broker-dealers, and independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions, including block, flow, and pension risk transfer, as well as funding agreements. Global Atlantic primarily generates income by earning a spread between its investment income and the cost of policyholder benefits. As of September 30, 2025, Global Atlantic served over three and a half million policyholders.\nOur Strategic Holdings business is currently comprised of the firm’s ownership in the businesses we acquired through our participation in our core private equity strategy. In our core private equity strategy, our objective is to acquire and manage controlling interests in operating companies, which we intend to hold over a longer period of time and that we believe have a lower anticipated risk profile than our investments in businesses acquired through our traditional private equity strategy. As of September 30, 2025, our Strategic Holdings segment consisted of our ownership stakes in 17 companies that we acquired through our core private equity strategy.\n111\nTable of Contents\nAsset Management\nOur asset management business offers a broad range of investment management services to fund investors around the world. In our asset management business, we have five business lines: (1) Private Equity, (2) Real Assets, (3) Credit and Liquid Strategies, (4) Capital Markets, and (5) Principal Activities. In addition to the overviews of each of these business lines provided in this report, please also refer to our Annual Report. As an asset management firm, we earn fees, including management fees and incentive fees, and carried interest for providing investment management and other services to our investment vehicles, CLOs, managed accounts, portfolio companies, and certain operating companies, and we generate transaction fees from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income by investing our own capital alongside investors in our investment vehicles and from other assets on our balance sheet. Carried interest we receive from our funds and certain other investment vehicles entitles us to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. On July 30, 2025, KKR acquired a majority ownership stake in HealthCare Royalty Management, LLC, a biopharma royalty acquisition company, which manages approximately $3 billion of assets and which is reported in growth equity within our Private Equity business line.\nPrivate Equity\nThrough our Private Equity business line, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic non-controlling minority positions. In addition to our traditional private equity funds that invest in large and mid-sized companies, we sponsor funds that invest in core private equity and growth equity, which includes technology, health care, and impact strategies. Our Private Equity business line includes separately managed accounts that invest in multiple strategies, which may include our credit and real assets strategies, as well as our private equity strategies. These funds and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC-registered investment adviser. As of September 30, 2025, our Private Equity business line had $222.2 billion of AUM, consisting of $160.4 billion in traditional private equity, $40.2 billion in core private equity and $21.6 billion in growth equity, which includes $4.5 billion of impact investments. \n \nThe table below presents information as of September 30, 2025, relating to our current private equity and other investment vehicles reported in our Private Equity business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest. This data does not reflect acquisitions or disposals of investments, changes in investment values, or distributions occurring after September 30, 2025.\n112\nTable of Contents\n \nInvestment Period\nAmount ($ in millions)\n \nStart\nDate\n(1)\nEnd\nDate \n(2)\nCommitment \n(3)\nUncalled\nCommitments\nInvested\nRealized\nRemaining\nCost \n(4)\nRemaining\nFair Value\nGross Accrued Carried Interest\nPrivate Equity Business Line\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNorth America Fund XIV\n4/2025\n4/2031\n$\n17,466 \n$\n17,466 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \nNorth America Fund XIII\n8/2021\n4/2025\n18,400 \n3,167 \n15,536 \n327 \n15,123 \n20,707 \n860 \nAmericas Fund XII\n5/2017\n5/2021\n13,500 \n1,381 \n12,751 \n14,776 \n9,138 \n19,038 \n1,683 \nNorth America Fund XI\n11/2012\n1/2017\n8,718 \n48 \n10,203 \n23,541 \n1,861 \n3,098 \n237 \n2006 Fund \n(5)\n9/2006\n9/2012\n17,642 \n— \n17,309 \n37,423 \n— \n— \n— \nMillennium Fund \n(5)\n12/2002\n12/2008\n6,000 \n— \n6,000 \n14,129 \n— \n— \n— \nAscendant Fund\n6/2022\n6/2028\n4,328 \n2,673 \n1,655 \n— \n1,655 \n1,784 \n3 \nEuropean Fund VI\n6/2022\n6/2028\n7,536 \n3,050 \n4,486 \n— \n4,486 \n4,666 \n— \nEuropean Fund V\n7/2019\n2/2022\n6,382 \n534 \n5,970 \n2,909 \n4,528 \n6,768 \n416 \nEuropean Fund IV\n2/2015\n3/2019\n3,513 \n17 \n3,648 \n5,726 \n1,621 \n2,412 \n138 \nEuropean Fund III \n(5)\n3/2008\n3/2014\n5,506 \n— \n5,360 \n10,647 \n— \n— \n— \nEuropean Fund II \n(5)\n11/2005\n10/2008\n5,751 \n— \n5,751 \n8,533 \n— \n— \n— \nAsian Fund IV\n7/2020\n7/2026\n14,735 \n6,360 \n9,549 \n3,948 \n8,683 \n13,329 \n868 \nAsian Fund III\n8/2017\n7/2020\n9,000 \n1,262 \n8,268 \n9,317 \n5,602 \n10,500 \n975 \nAsian Fund II\n10/2013\n3/2017\n5,825 \n— \n7,499 \n6,706 \n1,283 \n774 \n(346)\nAsian Fund \n(5)\n7/2007\n4/2013\n3,983 \n— \n3,974 \n8,728 \n— \n— \n— \nNext Generation Technology Growth Fund III\n11/2022\n11/2028\n2,740 \n1,079 \n1,661 \n— \n1,661 \n1,845 \n— \nNext Generation Technology Growth Fund II\n12/2019\n5/2022\n2,088 \n55 \n2,269 \n1,846 \n1,610 \n2,513 \n160 \nNext Generation Technology Growth Fund\n3/2016\n12/2019\n659 \n3 \n671 \n1,314 \n241 \n802 \n59 \nHealth Care Strategic Growth Fund II\n5/2021\n5/2027\n3,789 \n1,658 \n2,131 \n— \n2,131 \n2,742 \n59 \nHealth Care Strategic Growth Fund\n12/2016\n4/2021\n1,331 \n65 \n1,396 \n554 \n1,065 \n2,053 \n164 \nGlobal Impact Fund II\n6/2022\n6/2028\n2,715 \n1,526 \n1,189 \n— \n1,189 \n1,182 \n— \nGlobal Impact Fund\n2/2019\n3/2022\n1,242 \n214 \n1,211 \n638 \n950 \n1,540 \n113 \nCo-Investment Vehicles and Other\nVarious\nVarious\n38,124 \n3,422 \n35,452 \n16,134 \n26,574 \n32,772 \n1,507 \nCore Investors II\n8/2022\n8/2027\n11,814 \n7,978 \n3,838 \n108 \n3,838 \n4,565 \n8 \nCore Investors I\n2/2018\n8/2022\n8,500 \n23 \n9,924 \n1,658 \n8,443 \n17,350 \n47 \nOther Core Vehicles\nVarious\nVarious\n7,436 \n1,178 \n6,335 \n2,078 \n5,722 \n9,130 \n26 \nUnallocated Commitments\n (6)\nN/A\nN/A\n1,281 \n1,281 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal Private Equity\n \n \n$\n230,004\n \n$\n54,440\n \n$\n184,036\n \n$\n171,040\n \n$\n107,404\n \n$\n159,570\n \n$\n6,977\n \n(1)\nThe start date represents the start of the fund's investment period as defined in the fund's governing documents and may or may not be the same as the date upon which management fees begin to accrue.\n(2)\nThe end date represents the end of the fund's investment period as defined in the fund's governing documents and is generally not the date upon which management fees cease to accrue.

(Guernsey) L.P. (formerly known as KKR Private Equity Investors, L.P.) on October 1, 2009.\n(2)\nWhere commitments are not U.S. dollar-denominated, such amounts have been converted into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate prevailing on September 30, 2025.\n(3)\nThe gross IRR, net IRR and gross multiple of invested capital are calculated for our investment funds that made their first investment at least 24 months prior to September 30, 2025. We therefore have not calculated gross IRRs, net IRRs and gross multiples of invested capital with respect to these funds. \n115\nTable of Contents\n(4)\nAn investment is considered realized when it has been disposed of or has otherwise generated disposition proceeds or current income that has been distributed by the relevant fund. \n(5)\nIRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period. Net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. \nThe gross multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees or organizational expenses.\nKKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds may utilize third-party financing facilities to provide liquidity to such funds. The above net and gross IRRs are calculated from the time capital contributions are due from fund investors to the time fund investors receive a related distribution from the fund, and the use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of time that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds also generally provide in certain circumstances, which vary depending on the relevant fund documents, for a portion of capital returned to investors to be restored to unused commitments as recycled capital. For KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds that have a preferred return, we take into account recycled capital in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital because the calculation of the preferred return includes the effect of recycled capital. For KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds that do not have a preferred return, we do not take recycled capital into account in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital. The inclusion of recycled capital generally causes invested and realized amounts to be higher and IRRs and multiples of invested capital to be lower than had recycled capital not been included. The inclusion of recycled capital would reduce the composite net IRR of all Included Funds by 0.1% and the composite net IRR of all Legacy Funds by 0.5% and would reduce the composite multiple of invested capital of Included Funds by less than 0.1 and the composite multiple of invested capital of Legacy Funds by 0.4. \nFor more information, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Future results of our investments may be different than, and may not achieve the levels of, any of our historical returns\" in our Annual Report.\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nThrough our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line, we report our credit and hedge funds platforms on a combined basis. As of September 30, 2025, our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line had $314.7 billion of AUM, comprised of $142.9 billion of assets managed in our leveraged credit strategies, $84.0 billion of assets in asset-based finance, $47.4 billion in direct lending, $7.7 billion of assets managed in our SIG strategy, and $32.7 billion of assets managed through our hedge fund platform, which we refer to as the liquid strategies component of our credit and liquid strategies business. Asset-based finance and direct lending together represent our private credit strategy. We manage $160.1 billion of credit investments for our Global Atlantic insurance companies. Our BDCs have approximately $16.5 billion in assets under management, which is reflected in the AUM of our credit strategies above. We report all of the assets under management of our BDCs in our AUM, but we report only a pro rata portion of the assets under management of our hedge fund partnerships based on our percentage ownership in them.\nCredit\nOur credit platform invests capital in a broad range of corporate debt and collateral-backed investments across asset classes and capital structures. Our credit strategies are primarily managed by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, which is an SEC-registered investment adviser, KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”), KKR Credit Advisors (EMEA) LLP, which is regulated by the United Kingdom (\"UK\") Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\"), and KKR Credit Advisors (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., which is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and an SEC-registered investment adviser. We also jointly own with a third party FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, an investment adviser registered with the SEC that provides investment advisory services to certain registered investment companies, including FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK), a publicly listed BDC, KKR FS Income Trust, a privately-offered BDC and KKR FS Income Trust Select, a privately-offered BDC. \nOur credit business pursues a variety of investment strategies in leveraged credit and alternative credit.\nLeveraged Credit.\n Our leveraged credit strategies seek to primarily invest in assets such as leveraged loans (including revolving credit facilities), high yield bonds, and structured credit (including CLOs and asset-backed securities). Within leveraged credit, we manage both single-asset class and multi-asset class pools of capital. Our opportunistic credit strategy seeks to deploy capital across investment themes that seek to take advantage of credit market dislocations and relative value opportunities spanning, asset types and liquidity profiles. Our multi-asset credit strategy seeks to dynamically allocate across public liquid credit asset types in a broadly diversified strategy.\n116\nTable of Contents\nAlternative Credit. \nOur alternative credit strategy consists of our (i) private credit strategies and (ii) investments overseen by our credit platform’s strategic investments group (“SIG”):\n•\nPrivate Credit.\n Our private credit strategies focus on privately or directly originated and negotiated transactions. These strategies include direct lending typically in the senior part of a company’s capital structure, junior mezzanine debt, and asset-based finance. Through our direct lending strategy, we seek to make investments in primarily senior debt financings for middle-market companies. Through our junior mezzanine debt strategy, investments typically consist of subordinated debt, which generates a current yield, coupled with marginal equity exposure for additional upside potential. Our asset-based finance strategy focuses on multi-sector investments secured by portfolios of financial assets, including loans backed by hard assets across the risk-return spectrum. We also own 18 captive origination platforms that are dedicated to sourcing and structuring asset-based financial assets, hard assets, and contractual cash flows.\n•\nStrategic Investments Group.\n This strategy seeks to provide strategic capital solutions to high quality, mid-to-large cap companies and assets. The strategy pursues investment capital solutions in corporate credit where we believe market volatility or other investment themes have created the opportunity to invest opportunistically across the capital structure and through market cycles to generate outsized returns, and which may include investment terms intended to offer various levels of downside-protection. These investment opportunities may include debt (senior and junior), preferred equity, convertible debt, and structured equity. These investments may include non-control-oriented opportunities, a variety of capital solutions for third-party investment vehicles, balance sheet optimization capital solutions, strategic partner capital, and other event-driven investments in debt or equity.\nHedge Fund Platform\nOur hedge fund platform consists of strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. This principally consists of a 39.6% interest in Marshall Wace LLP (together with its affiliates, \"Marshall Wace\"), a global alternative investment manager specializing in long/short equity products.\nThe table below presents information as of September 30, 2025, relating to our current credit investment vehicles reported in our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest.

The S&P/LSTA Loan Index is a daily tradable index for the U.S. loan market that seeks to mirror the market-weighted performance of the largest institutional loans that meet certain criteria. The BoAML HY Master II Index is an index for high-yield corporate bonds. It is designed to measure the broad high-yield market, including lower-rated securities. The CS Inst West European Leveraged Loan Index contains only institutional loan facilities priced above 90, excluding TL and TLa facilities and loans rated CC, C or are in default. The S&P European Leveraged Loan Index reflects the market-weighted performance of institutional leveraged loan portfolios investing in European credits. While the returns of our leveraged credit strategies reflect the reinvestment of income and dividends, none of the indices presented in the chart above reflect such reinvestment, which has the effect of increasing the reported relative performance of these strategies as compared to the indices. Furthermore, these indices are not subject to management fees, incentive allocations, or expenses.\n(2)\nPerformance is based on a blended composite of Bank Loans, High Yield, and Structured Credit strategy accounts. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Multi-Asset Credit Composite strategy is based on 65% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 35% BoAML HY Master II Index to May 2022, and 50% S&P/LSTA Loan Index, 50% BoAML HY Master II Index, from June 2022.\n(3)\nThe Opportunistic Credit strategy invests in high-yield securities and corporate loans with no preset allocation. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Opportunistic Credit strategy presented herein is based on 50% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 50% BoAML HY Master II Index. Funds within this strategy may utilize third-party financing facilities to enhance investment returns. In cases where financing facilities are used, the amounts drawn on the facility are deducted from the assets of the fund in the calculation of net asset value, which tends to increase returns when net asset value grows over time and decrease returns when net asset value decreases over time.\n(4)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Bank Loans strategy is based on the S&P/LSTA Loan Index.\n(5)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in high-yield securities. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the High Yield strategy is based on the BoAML HY Master II Index.\n(6)\nThe returns presented are calculated based on local currency. \n(7)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in higher quality leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the European Leveraged Loans strategy is based on the CS Inst West European Leveraged Loan Index.\n(8)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in European institutional leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the European Credit Opportunities strategy is based on the S&P European Leveraged Loans (All Loans) Index. \n118\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents information regarding our alternative credit investment funds where investors have capital commitments from inception to September 30, 2025.

The use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. IRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period and are calculated taking into account recycled capital. Net IRRs presented are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses.\n(3)\nThe multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the investors. The use of financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate multiples of invested capital, which tends to increase multiples when fair value grows over time and decrease multiples when fair value decreases over time. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of any realized and unrealized returns on a fund's investments to the fund's general partner pursuant to a carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees and are calculated without taking into account recycled capital. \nFor additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can, and periodically do, materially and adversely affect KKR.\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Future results of our investments may be different than, and may not achieve the levels of, any of our historical returns\" in our Annual Report.\n119\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information as of September 30, 2025, based on the investment funds or other investment vehicles or accounts offered by our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line.

These services include arranging debt and equity financing, placing and underwriting securities offerings, and providing other types of capital markets services that result in the firm receiving fees, including underwriting, placement, transaction and syndication fees, commissions, underwriting discounts, interest payments and other compensation, which may be payable in cash or securities, in respect of the activities described above. Third-party clients of our capital markets business include multi-national corporations, public and private companies, financial sponsors, mutual funds, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and hedge funds globally. Our capital markets business provides these clients with differentiated access to capital through our distribution platform.\nOur capital markets business underwrites credit facilities and arranges loan syndications and participations. When we are sole or lead arrangers of a credit facility, we may advance amounts to the borrower on behalf of other lenders, subject to repayment. When we underwrite an offering of securities on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities and generate revenue by purchasing the securities at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity or best efforts basis, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing securities with capital markets investors. We may also provide issuers with capital markets advice on capital structuring, access to markets, marketing considerations, securities pricing, and other aspects of capital markets transactions in exchange for a fee. Our capital markets business also provides syndication services in respect of co-investments in transactions participated in by KKR, our funds, Global Atlantic, and third-party clients, which may entitle the firm to receive syndication fees, management fees, and/or a carried interest.\nThe capital markets business has a global footprint, with local presence and licenses to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Our flagship capital markets subsidiaries include KKR Capital Markets LLC, which is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of FINRA, KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, KKR Capital Markets Partners LLP, which is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, KKR Capital Markets Japan Limited, a Type I and Type II Financial Instruments Business Operator (broker dealer) under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan, KKR Capital Markets Asia Limited, a Hong Kong licensed asset manager and broker-dealer licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong to carry on dealing in securities, advising on securities and asset management regulated activities, and KKR Capital Markets Asia II Limited, a Hong Kong licensed broker-dealer licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong to carry on dealing in securities and advising on securities.\nPrincipal Activities\nThrough our Principal Activities business line, we manage certain of the firm’s assets and deploy capital to support and grow our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. \nTypically, the funds in our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines contractually require us, as general partner of the funds, to make sizable capital commitments. We believe making general partner commitments assists us in raising new funds from limited partners by demonstrating our conviction in a given fund’s strategy. Our commitments to fund capital also occurs where we are the holder of the subordinated notes or the equity tranche of investment vehicles that we sponsor, including structured transactions. We also use our balance sheet to bridge investment activity during fundraising and, for example, by funding investments for new funds. We also use our own capital to bridge capital selectively for our funds’ investments or finance strategic transactions, although the financial results of an acquired business may be reported in our other business lines.\nOur Principal Activities business line also provides the required capital to fund the various commitments of our Capital Markets business line when underwriting or syndicating securities, or when providing term loan commitments for transactions involving our portfolio companies and for third parties. Our Principal Activities business line also holds assets that are utilized to satisfy regulatory requirements for our Capital Markets business line and risk retention requirements for certain investment vehicles.\nWe also make opportunistic investments through our Principal Activities business line, which include co-investments alongside our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies funds, as well as Principal Activities investments that do not involve our Private Equity, Real Assets, or Credit and Liquid Strategies funds.\nWe endeavor to use our balance sheet strategically and opportunistically to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on equity in a manner that is consistent with our fiduciary duties, in compliance with applicable laws, and consistent with our one firm approach.\n121\nTable of Contents\nThe chart below presents the holdings of our Principal Activities business line by asset class as of September 30, 2025, excluding our ownership of businesses reported through our Strategic Holdings segment.\nHoldings by Asset Class \n(1)\n(1)\nGeneral partner commitments to our funds are included in the various asset classes shown above. Assets and revenues of other asset managers with which KKR has formed strategic partnerships where KKR does not hold more than 50% ownership interest are not included in our Principal Activities business line but are reported in the financial results of our other business lines. \n122\nTable of Contents\nInsurance\nOur insurance business is operated by Global Atlantic, which operates as a separate business with its existing brands and management team. KKR acquired a majority controlling interest in Global Atlantic on February 1, 2021 and the remainder of Global Atlantic on January 2, 2024. Since the first quarter of 2021, we have presented Global Atlantic's financial results as a separate reportable segment.\nGlobal Atlantic is a leading retirement and life insurance company that provides a broad suite of protection, legacy and savings products to customers and reinsurance solutions to clients across individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic focuses on target markets that it believes support issuing products that have attractive risk and return characteristics. These markets allow Global Atlantic to leverage its strength in distribution and to deploy shareholder capital opportunistically across various market environments. \nGlobal Atlantic offers individual customers fixed-rate annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, and preneed life insurance products primarily through a network of banks, broker-dealers, and independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions, including block, flow, and pension risk transfer (\"PRT\") transactions, as well as funding agreements. Global Atlantic’s assets generally increase when individual market sales and reinsurance transactions exceed run-off of in-force policies. Global Atlantic primarily generates income by earning a spread on assets under management, as the difference between its net investment income and the cost of policyholder benefits. Global Atlantic also earns fees paid by policyholders on certain types of contracts and fees paid by third-party investors, which are reported in the asset management segment. As of September 30, 2025, Global Atlantic served over three and a half million policyholders.\nGlobal Atlantic also sponsors co-investment vehicles (\"Ivy and other co-investment vehicles\") that provide third-party capital to support Global Atlantic’s business. Ivy and other co-investment vehicles participate alongside Global Atlantic, primarily in certain block, flow, PRT, and other reinsurance transactions that Global Atlantic enters into during the vehicles’ respective investment periods. Ivy and other co-investment vehicles generally are not consolidated into our financial statements. As of September 30, 2025, third parties have committed capital to Ivy and other co-investment vehicles of approximately $7.8 billion, of which $3.3 billion has been deployed. On July 30, 2025, Global Atlantic announced an additional $2 billion commitment to a co-investment vehicle that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to access certain insurance, reinsurance, and strategic transactions of Global Atlantic.\nIn addition to the overview of our insurance business operated by Global Atlantic provided in this report, please also refer to our Annual Report.

Life insurance product sales do not include the recurring premiums that policyholders may pay over time.\n(2)\nBlock reinsurance transactions may be episodic and volumes may fluctuate. Similarly, certain funding agreements are subject to capital markets conditions and volumes may fluctuate. Flow and pension risk transfer new business volumes typically occur throughout the year.\n(3)\nNew business volumes from Global Atlantic’s institutional market channel are based on the assets assumed, net of any ceding commission, and are gross of any retrocessions to investment vehicles that participate in qualifying reinsurance transactions sourced by Global Atlantic and to other third party reinsurers.\nThe table below represents a breakdown of Global Atlantic’s policy liabilities by business and product type as of September 30, 2025, separated by reserves originated through its individual and institutional markets.\nReserves as of September 30, 2025\nIndividual Market\nInstitutional Market\n(3)\nTotal\nCeded\nTotal, net\nPercentage of Total\n($ in thousands, except percentages, if applicable)\nFixed-Rate Annuities\n(1)\n$\n29,955,736 \n$\n38,565,461 \n$\n68,521,197 \n$\n(10,827,261)\n$\n57,693,936 \n33.5 \n%\nFixed-Indexed Annuities\n(1)\n33,386,531 \n11,298,761 \n44,685,292 \n(5,025,118)\n39,660,174 \n21.9 \n%\nPayout Annuities\n(1)\n618,634 \n24,340,347 \n24,958,981 \n(12,142,359)\n12,816,622 \n12.2 \n%\nVariable Annuities\n2,147,233 \n5,206,093 \n7,353,326 \n(2,065,208)\n5,288,118 \n3.6 \n%\nInterest Sensitive Life\n(1)\n13,587,707 \n18,884,858 \n32,472,565 \n(8,623,723)\n23,848,842 \n15.9 \n%\nOther Life Insurance\n(2)\n4,145,356 \n4,145,879 \n8,291,235 \n(2,865,381)\n5,425,854 \n4.1 \n%\nFunding Agreements\n— \n12,473,915 \n12,473,915 \n— \n12,473,915 \n6.1 \n%\nClosed Block and Other Corporate Products\n— \n1,034,878 \n1,034,878 \n(970,694)\n64,184 \n0.5 \n%\nOther\n(4)\n— \n4,622,332 \n4,622,332 \n(3,755,060)\n867,272 \n2.2 \n%\nTotal Reserves\n$\n83,841,197\n \n$\n120,572,524\n \n$\n204,413,721\n \n$\n(46,274,804)\n$\n158,138,917\n \n100.0\n \n%\nTotal General Account\n$\n81,960,278 \n$\n118,547,029 \n$\n200,507,307 \n$\n(46,274,804)\n$\n154,232,503 \n98.1 \n%\nTotal Separate Account\n1,880,919 \n2,025,495 \n3,906,414 \n— \n3,906,414 \n1.9 \n%\nTotal Reserves\n$\n83,841,197\n \n$\n120,572,524\n \n$\n204,413,721\n \n$\n(46,274,804)\n$\n158,138,917\n \n100.0\n \n%\n(1)\nAs of September 30, 2025, 83% of the account value in Global Atlantic's general account associated with its fixed-rate and fixed-indexed annuity products, and 38% of account value in its general account associated with universal life products was protected by surrender charges.\n(2)\n\"Other life products” includes universal life, term and whole life insurance products.\n(3)\nInstitutional market reserves are sourced using customized reinsurance solutions such as block, flow and PRT.

In our core private equity strategy, our objective is to acquire and manage controlling interests in operating companies, which we intend to hold over a longer period of time and that we believe have a lower anticipated risk profile than our investments in businesses acquired through our traditional private equity strategy. Our core private equity portfolio companies are generally expected to be more stable and typically have lower leverage over our holding period than our traditional private equity portfolio companies. We have acquired assets in our Strategic Holdings segment that are not part of the core private equity strategy, and our Strategic Holdings segment is not limited to a specific industry or constrained to any investment strategy that we may manage for our investment funds or vehicles. \nAs of September 30, 2025, our Strategic Holdings segment consisted of our ownership stakes in 17 companies that we acquired through our core private equity strategy. Based on certain information made available to management as of September 30, 2025, approximately 68% of these companies are based in the Americas, 27% in Europe, and 5% in the Asia-Pacific (based on the geographic location of their headquarters). In addition, based on such information, these companies are primarily engaged in the following business sectors: approximately 36% in Business Services, 28% in Consumer, 17% in Healthcare, 13% in technology-media-telecommunications (TMT), and 6% in Infrastructure. We currently expect our Strategic Holdings segment to generate income from the receipt of dividends from our ownership stakes in these businesses, and if any ownership stake were to be sold, we would recognize realized investment income from such sale.\nThe fees and carried interest paid by the third party investors in our core private equity funds continues to be reported in our Asset Management segment and are not reported in our Strategic Holdings segment. Our Asset Management segment charges a quarterly management fee based on invested capital in our Strategic Holdings segment. Additionally, our Asset Management segment charges a performance fee from the sale of our interests in the companies included in our Strategic Holdings segment. The management and performance fees are charged in order to represent the cost of providing advisory services by our Asset Management segment rather than determining the allocable costs borne by our Asset Management segment to support our Strategic Holdings segment.\nBusiness Environment\nOur asset management, insurance, and strategic holdings segments are affected by the various market and economic conditions of the various countries and regions in which we operate. Market and economic conditions are expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and our business in various ways that we are unable to control, including our ability to make new investments, the valuations of the investments we manage, the amount of investment proceeds we realize when we exit our investments, the timing for such realization activity, our ability to fundraise or to sell our various investment and insurance products and services, and the level of our capital markets activities, as discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section of our Annual Report. \nThe United States, during the three months ended September 30, 2025, experienced an expansion in economic growth while also continuing to experience inflation in excess of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s target rate. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board decided to lower the target range to a range of 4.00% to 4.25% for the federal funds rate noting softening labor market conditions as a primary consideration in deciding to lower the target range despite inflation exceeding its target.\nReal gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth in the Eurozone during the three months ended September 30, 2025 was moderately positive. In Europe during the three months ended September 30, 2025, the European Central Bank maintained interest rates at the same level as prior quarter, leaving the deposit rate unchanged at 2.0% as Eurozone core inflation accelerated compared to the prior quarter and remained slightly above the European Central Bank’s 2% inflation target.\nIn Asia, Japan’s economy is expected to have experienced negative growth in the third quarter of 2025 driven by an expected slowdown in consumer spending and export volumes. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates flat during the three months ended September 30, 2025, leaving its policy rate at 0.50%. In China, the economy grew during the three months ended September 30, 2025 but continued to experience divergent economic conditions and headwinds as Chinese growth remains subject to various headwinds including in the property sector and uncertainty relating to a potential trade war with the United States as discussed further below.\n125\nTable of Contents\nSeveral key economic indicators in the United States and in other countries and regions in which we operate include:\n•\nGDP.\n In the United States, real GDP is estimated to have expanded at an annualized rate of 2.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to an annualized expansion of 3.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2025.

The unemployment rate in China was 5.2% as of September 30, 2025, flat from 5.2% as of June 30, 2025.\nSeveral key financial market indicators in the United States and in other countries and regions in which we operate include: \n•\nEquity Markets.\n For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the S&P 500 was up 8.1%, the MSCI Europe Index was up 4.6%, the MSCI Asia Index was up 9.4% and the MSCI World Index was up 7.4% on a total return basis including dividends. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of volatility, ended at 16.3 as of September 30, 2025, decreasing from 16.7 as of June 30, 2025.\n•\nCredit Markets.\n During the three months ended September 30, 2025, U.S. investment grade corporate bond spreads (BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index) tightened by 10 basis points.

This volatility and uncertainty adds to the various risks and uncertainties in the business environment in which we operate and may have various impacts, including on the valuations of certain of our and our investment vehicles' investments, the pace and volume of our capital market transactions, deployments, and realizations, and our fundraising activities. \n126\nTable of Contents\nOther Trends, Uncertainties and Risks Related to Our Business\nPlease refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section of our Annual Report for important additional detail regarding risks, uncertainties, and other conditions that could have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on our businesses, including the impact of market and economic conditions on valuations of investments and the impact of competition we face.\n \nThese risks, uncertainties, and other conditions should be read in conjunction with this Business Environment section and the entire Risk Factor section of our Annual Report. In particular, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Geopolitical developments and other local and global events outside of our control can materially and adversely impact KKR”, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Our valuation methodologies for certain assets can be subjective, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such subjective methodologies is uncertain and may never be realized”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Various market and economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on our financial results”, and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The investment management and insurance businesses are intensely competitive.\"\nBasis of Accounting and Key Financial Measures under GAAP\nWe manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our operating activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See Note 2 “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our financial statements and “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in this section below. Our key Segment and non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics are discussed below. \nKey Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures \nThe following key segment and non-GAAP performance measures are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the performance of KKR's business. They include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These performance measures as described below are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. Inc. and holders of exchangeable securities and as such represent the entire KKR business in total. In addition, these performance measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of certain investment funds and collateralized financing entities (\"CFEs\") that KKR manages.\nWe believe that providing these segment and non-GAAP performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's business. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable are included under \"—Segment Balance Sheet Measures—Reconciliations to GAAP Measures.\"\n127\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income (\"ANI\") is a performance measure of KKR’s earnings, which is derived from KKR’s reported segment results. ANI is used to assess the performance of KKR’s business operations and measures the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business. ANI is equal to Total Segment Earnings less Interest Expense, Net and Other and Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings. Interest Expense, Net and Other includes interest expense on debt obligations not attributable to any particular segment and the cumulative dividend expense for the Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock net of interest income earned on cash and short-term investments. Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings represents the (i) amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax Asset Management and Strategic Holdings segment earnings were allocated to KKR & Co. Inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which assumes that all securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. were exchanged and (ii) amount of income taxes on Insurance Operating Earnings. Income taxes on Insurance Operating Earnings represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. Equity based compensation expense is excluded from ANI, because (i) KKR believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes KKR’s reporting metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in KKR’s industry, which KKR believes enhances an investor’s ability to compare KKR’s performance to these other companies. Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings includes the benefit of tax deductions arising from equity-based compensation, which reduces Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings during the period. If tax deductions from equity-based compensation were to be excluded from Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings, KKR’s ANI would be lower and KKR’s effective tax rate would appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually been paid or payable during the period. KKR separately discloses the amount of tax deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its inclusion in ANI for the period. KKR makes these adjustments when calculating ANI in order to more accurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available for distribution to KKR’s equity holders or reinvestment into KKR’s business. However, ANI does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under KKR’s dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and ANI should not be viewed as a measure of KKR’s liquidity.\nTotal Segment Earnings\nTotal Segment Earnings is a performance measure that KKR believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that KKR does not believe arise from or relate directly to KKR's operations. Total Segment Earnings excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, and (iii) transaction-related and non-operating items, if any. Transaction-related and non-operating items primarily arise from corporate actions, which consist of: (i) impairments, (ii) transaction costs from acquisitions, including any acquisition-related stock consideration, (iii) depreciation on real estate that KKR owns and occupies, (iv) contingent liabilities, net of any recoveries, (v) certain integration, restructuring, and other non-operating expenses, and (vi) other gains or charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of KKR's ongoing operational performance. Inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. These transactions include (i) management fees earned by our Asset Management segment as the investment adviser for Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) management and performance fees earned by our Asset Management segment for acquiring and managing the companies included in our Strategic Holdings segment, and (iii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where our Asset Management segment borrows from our Insurance segment. All these inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the applicable governing agreements. Additionally, due to the integrated nature of our segment operations and as part of our strategic capital allocation decisions, intersegment asset transfers have and may continue to occur. In these cases in segment reporting, the assets are transferred at their fair value, and no realization is recognized at the time of transfer. Earnings are recognized upon realization events and transactions with third parties. Total Segment Earnings represents the total segment earnings of KKR’s Asset Management, Insurance and Strategic Holdings segments.\n128\nTable of Contents\nAsset Management Segment Earnings\nAsset management segment earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Realized Performance Income, (iii) Realized Performance Income Compensation, (iv) Realized Investment Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income Compensation. Asset Management Segment Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized gains (losses) on investments, (ii) unrealized carried interest, and (iii) unrealized carried interest compensation. Management fees earned by KKR as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts, including its Global Atlantic insurance companies and Strategic Holdings segment, are included in Asset Management Segment Earnings.\nInsurance Operating Earnings\nInsurance Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Insurance segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Net Investment Income, (ii) Net Cost of Insurance, and (iii) General, Administrative, and Other Expenses. Insurance Operating Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) investment gains (losses) which include realized gains (losses) related to asset/liability matching investment strategies and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (ii) non-operating changes in policy liabilities and derivatives which includes (a) changes in the fair value of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities measured at fair value and related benefit payments, (b) fees attributed to guaranteed benefits, (c) derivatives used to manage the risks associated with policy liabilities, and (d) losses at contract issuance on payout annuities. Insurance Operating Earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/liability matching investment strategies and (ii) the investment management costs that are earned by our Asset Management segment as the investment adviser of the Global Atlantic insurance companies. \nStrategic Holdings Segment Earnings\nStrategic Holdings Segment Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Strategic Holdings segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: Dividends, Net and Net Realized Investment Income. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings excludes the impact of unrealized gains (losses) on investments. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings includes management fees and performance fee expenses that are earned by the Asset Management segment. \nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess the Asset Management segment’s generation of earnings from revenues that are measured and received on a more recurring basis as compared to KKR’s investing earnings. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of our fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses. FRE equals (i) Management Fees, including fees paid by the Insurance and Strategic Holdings segments to the Asset Management segment and fees paid by Ivy vehicles and other reinsurance vehicles, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (x) Fee Related Compensation, and (y) Other Operating Expenses.\nFee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of performance fees from certain AUM that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. Fee related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) expected to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.\nFee Related Compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, paid from (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues.\nOther Operating Expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges and (ii) other operating expenses.\n129\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Holdings Operating Earnings\nStrategic Holdings Operating Earnings is a performance measure used to assess the firm’s earnings from companies and businesses reported through its Strategic Holdings segment. Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings currently consists of earnings derived from dividends that the firm receives from businesses acquired through the firm’s participation in our core private equity strategy. Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings currently equals dividends less management fees that are earned by our Asset Management segment. This measure is used by management to assess the Strategic Holdings segment’s generation of earnings from revenues that are measured and received on a more recurring basis than, and are not dependent on, realizations from investment activities.\nTotal Operating Earnings\nTotal Operating Earnings is a performance measure that represents the sum of (i) FRE, (ii) Insurance Operating Earnings, and (iii) Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of the most recurring forms of earnings from each of KKR’s segments as compared to investing earnings.\nTotal Investing Earnings\nTotal Investing Earnings is a performance measure that represents the sum of (i) Net Realized Performance Income and (ii) Net Realized Investment Income. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the earnings of KKR’s segments from the realization of investments.\nTotal Asset Management Segment Revenues\nTotal Asset Management Segment Revenues is a performance measure that represents the realized revenues of the Asset Management segment (which excludes unrealized carried interest and unrealized gains (losses) on investments) and is the sum of (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, (iv) Realized Performance Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income. Asset Management Segment Revenues excludes Realized Investment Income earned based on the performance of businesses presented in the Strategic Holdings segment. KKR believes that this performance measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into all forms of realized revenues generated by our Asset Management segment.\nKey Operating and Capital Metrics\nAssets Under Management\nAssets under management represent the assets managed (including core private equity), advised or sponsored by KKR from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees or performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic BDC partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of KKR and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds and certain co-investment vehicles; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the asset value of the Global Atlantic insurance companies; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs; (v) KKR's pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest; (vi) all of the AUM of KKR's strategic BDC partnership; (vii) the acquisition cost of invested assets of certain non-US real estate investment trusts and (viii) the value of other assets managed or sponsored by KKR. The pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on KKR’s percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity’s respective AUM. KKR's definition of AUM (i) is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which KKR does not act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. \n130\nTable of Contents\nCapital Invested\nCapital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) KKR’s investment funds (including core private equity) and Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) KKR's Principal Activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) KKR's Principal Activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by KKR's Capital Markets business line, if any. Capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at KKR during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across KKR’s business lines. Capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. Capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by KKR’s Capital Markets business line. Capital syndicated by KKR's Capital Markets business line to third parties other than KKR’s investment funds or Principal Activities business line is not included in capital invested. \nFee Paying AUM\nFee paying AUM represents only the AUM from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's and its hedge fund and BDC partnership management fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which KKR is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.\nUncalled Commitments\nUncalled commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that KKR’s investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles (including core private equity) have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments, and the amount of uncalled commitments is not reduced by capital invested using borrowings under an investment fund’s subscription facility until capital is called from our fund investors. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR’s investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments.

The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees earned from Ascendant (our U.S. middle market traditional private equity strategy fund) due to management fees earned on new capital raised in the third quarter of 2024 that were retroactive to the start of the fund’s investment period and no such retroactive fees were earned for the three months ended September 30, 2025, (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from North America Fund XIII as a result of entering its post-investment period in the second quarter of 2025 and now paying fees based on invested capital rather than committed capital, and (iii) no management fees earned from Asian Fund II in the current period due to the termination of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nManagement fees due from consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\"\nFee credits decreased compared to the prior period as a result of a lower level of transaction fees in our Private Equity, Real Assets and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. Transaction and monitoring fees earned from our portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit.\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our unconsolidated carry earning investment funds, most notably North America Fund XIII, our private equity and infrastructure K-Series vehicles, and Global Infrastructure Investors IV. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our unconsolidated carry earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, North America Fund XIII, and Global Infrastructure Investors IV.\nKKR calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.\nInvestment Income (Loss) \nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the three months ended September 30, 2025\nThe net gains from investment activities for the three months ended September 30, 2025, were comprised of net realized gains of $310.4 million and net unrealized gains of $887.4 million.\nInvestment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) as described above.\n134\nTable of Contents\nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, net realized gains related primarily to realized gains from the sales of CyrusOne Inc. (infrastructure: telecommunications infrastructure sector), and Refresco Group B.V. (infrastructure). Partially offsetting these realized gains were (i) realized losses on certain investments held in our consolidated credit funds, and (ii) realized losses from certain investments held in consolidated CLOs.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, net unrealized gains were driven by (i) mark-to-market gains primarily relating to Heartland Dental LLC (healthcare sector), Headlands Research, Inc. (healthcare sector), and \nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc. \n(NASDAQ: BBIO), (ii) unrealized gains on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses relating to the realization activity described above. The unrealized gains were partially offset by (i) mark-to-market losses relating to OneStream, Inc. (NASDAQ: OS) and PetVet Care Centers, LLC (health care sector) and (ii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above.\nThe factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net gains were primarily generated in the following asset classes:\n•\nPrivate Equity (including core private equity), which were primarily impacted by overall positive operating performance of certain portfolio companies. Changes in market multiples varied across regions / sectors used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments; and\n•\nInfrastructure, which primarily benefited from the overall positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets, partially offset by slightly higher cost of capital assumptions. Changes in market multiples varied across regions / sectors used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments.\nSee \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about risks, uncertainties, and other market and economic conditions that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuation.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nThe net gains from investment activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were comprised of net realized gains of $252.5 million and net unrealized gains of $1,062.1 million.\nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net realized gains related primarily to realized gains from the sale of FiberCop S.p.A. (infrastructure: telecommunications infrastructure sector), BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. and Gamma Biosciences L.P. (healthcare sector). Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses on our investments in Unzer GmbH (financial services sector) and Qoo10 SG (technology sector).\nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized gains were driven by (i) mark-to-market gains primarily relating to OneStream, Inc., Exact Holding B.V. (technology sector), and April SA (financial services sector) and (ii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses relating to the realized losses described above. These unrealized gains were partially offset by (i) unrealized losses on certain foreign exchange derivative contracts, (ii) mark-to-market losses at certain of our consolidated credit funds, and (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above.\nThe factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net gains were primarily generated in the following asset classes:\n•\nPrivate equity (including core private equity), which were primarily impacted by (i) overall positive operating performance of its portfolio companies, and (ii) the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments; and\n135\nTable of Contents\n•\nInfrastructure, which primarily benefited from the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets and, to a lesser extent, by the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments.\nFor a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" For additional information about net gains (losses) from investment activities, see Note 4 \"Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management and Strategic Holdings\" in our financial statements.\nDividend Income\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, dividend income was primarily from (i) our investment in 1-800 Contacts Inc. held through our consolidated core vehicles and (ii) various investments in certain of our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, dividend income was primarily from (i) certain of our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds and (ii) our investments in Exact Holding B.V., Arnott's Biscuits Limited (consumer products sector) and Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc. (infrastructure: transportation sector), each held through our consolidated core investment vehicles. \nSignificant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" \nInterest Income\nThe decrease in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates during the current period on floating rate credit investments held in consolidated CLOs and certain of our consolidated private credit funds. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of closing CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to September 30, 2024. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\"\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to (i) the impact of closing CLOs that were consolidated subsequent to September 30, 2024, and (ii) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding. The increase was partially offset by the impact of lower market interest rates during the current period on floating rate debt obligations held in consolidated CLOs and at certain consolidated funds and other investment vehicles. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see \"—Key Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures.\"\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits Expense\nThe decrease in compensation and benefits expense during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a lower level of accrued carried interest compensation driven by a lower level of carried interest income earned in the current period, partially offset by accrued discretionary cash compensation resulting from a higher level of asset management fee related segment revenues in the current period.\nOccupancy and Related Charges\nThe decrease in occupancy and related charges during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a prior period accelerated rent payment for one of our office leases that did not recur in the current period, partially offset by the commencement of new office leases subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nThe increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a higher level of issuance costs from newly formed consolidated CLOs in the current period, expenses reimbursable from our unconsolidated investment funds and corporate general administrative costs, partially offset by a prior year legal accrual that did not recur in the current period.\n136\nTable of Contents\nCondensed Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis - Unaudited) - Insurance \nRevenues\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, revenues consisted of the following: \n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nNet Premiums\n$\n1,059,610 \n$\n621,218 \n$\n438,392 \nPolicy Fees\n339,735 \n375,371 \n(35,636)\nNet Investment Income\n1,969,779 \n1,701,826 \n267,953 \nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n351,800 \n(235,971)\n587,771 \nOther Income\n61,049 \n60,162 \n887 \nTotal Insurance Revenues\n$\n3,781,973\n \n$\n2,522,606\n \n$\n1,259,367\n \nNet Premiums\nNet premiums increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in new premiums earned on direct pension risk transfer and preneed insurance products with life contingencies or morbidity risk. Initial premiums on new business are generally offset by a comparable change in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below under “Expenses—Net policy benefits and claims”). \nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets as a result of the cumulative impact of Global Atlantic's institutional market and individual market channels sales growth in the current and preceding quarters, and (ii) higher average portfolio yields.\nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net investment-related gains (losses) were as follows:\n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nEquity Index Options\n$\n466,343 \n$\n231,926 \n$\n234,417 \nFunds Withheld Payable Embedded Derivatives\n(453,627)\n(1,305,338)\n851,711 \nFunds Withheld Receivable Embedded Derivatives\n(30,797)\n(19,012)\n(11,785)\nForeign Exchange and Other Derivative Contracts\n104,968 \n(84,416)\n189,384 \nInterest Rate Contracts\n30,581 \n324,733 \n(294,152)\nEquity Futures Contracts\n(39,386)\n(25,426)\n(13,960)\nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\n78,082\n \n(877,533)\n955,615\n \nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\n273,718 \n641,562 \n(367,844)\nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n$\n351,800\n \n$\n(235,971)\n$\n587,771\n \n137\nTable of Contents\nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\nThe increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of certain fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and real asset investments. The underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio increased in value during both the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, resulting in a smaller loss on the related embedded derivative. The increase in fair value of the underlying investments were primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates during both three months ended September 30, 2025, and three months ended September 30, 2024, with a smaller relative increase in market interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe increase in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the underlying indices. Global Atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). The majority of Global Atlantic's equity index options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which had a comparatively larger increase during the three months ended September 30, 2025, than during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an increase in the notional amount of equity market contracts outstanding.\nThe increase in the fair value of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts was primarily driven by foreign exchange gains due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar (primarily against the euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar) during the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nThe decrease in the fair value of interest rate contracts was primarily driven by a smaller decrease in market interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a comparatively smaller gain on interest rate contracts for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net other investment gains (losses) were as follows:\n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nRealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Not Supporting Asset-Liability Matching Strategies\n$\n8,710 \n$\n6,626 \n$\n2,084 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturity Securities\n(50,492)\n(285,352)\n234,860 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Funds Withheld at Interest Receivable Portfolio\n(4,004)\n(24,194)\n20,190 \nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Fixed Maturity Securities Classified as Trading\n381,315 \n1,056,483 \n(675,168)\nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Real Assets\n31,867 \n(20,041)\n51,908 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Funds Withheld at Interest Payable Portfolio\n(35,391)\n(20,158)\n(15,233)\nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Other Investments Accounted Under a Fair-Value Option and Equity Investments\n62,059 \n14,127 \n47,932 \nCredit Loss Allowances\n(74,362)\n(153,151)\n78,789 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Real Assets\n362 \n(286)\n648 \nForeign Exchange Gains (Losses) on Non-USD Denominated Investments\n(42,550)\n77,046 \n(119,596)\nOther\n(3,796)\n(9,538)\n5,742 \nNet Other Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n$\n273,718\n \n$\n641,562\n \n$\n(367,844)\n138\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in net other investment-related gains for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to (i) a decrease in unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities classified as trading primarily as a result of a smaller decrease in market interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, and (ii) increases in foreign exchange losses on non-USD denominated investments due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and British pound.\nPartially offsetting these decreases in net other investment-related gains were a decrease in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities due to low yield trades in the prior period.\nExpenses \nNet Policy Benefits and Claims\nNet policy benefits and claims increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to (i) an increase in new business volumes from direct pension risk transfer and preneed insurance business (with life contingencies or morbidity risk) and higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the ordinary-course run-off of older business originated in a low interest rate environment. \nThese increases were partially offset by (i) a smaller change in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic’s fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of the increase equity market gains for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 (as discussed above under \"\n—\nConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)\n—\nRevenues\n—\nNet investment-related gains (losses)\". Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains (losses) on derivative instruments, and generally offsets the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims), and (ii) the favorable impacts related to the assumption review described below.\nThe assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimate of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses, and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter, referred to as an “assumption review.” As Global Atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent Global Atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an “unlocking” impact. Generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, there was a net favorable assumption review impact of $106.2 million on net policy benefits and claims, which was primarily due to (i) higher expected yield assumptions for certain interest-sensitive life products, (ii) favorable expected surrender and persistency assumption changes for certain income annuity, variable annuity, and life insurance products, and (iii) a decrease in expected morbidity assumptions on long-term care riders for certain fixed annuity products, offset in part by (i) higher mortality rate assumptions for certain life insurance products, and (ii) higher surrender rate assumptions for certain assumed annuity products.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net favorable assumption review impact of $74.6 million on income before taxes was primarily due to (i) higher assumed mortality rates for guaranteed income riders on income fixed-indexed annuities, and (ii) higher assumed interest rate margins on certain interest-sensitive life products due to higher reinvestment rates and flat crediting rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by (i) lower assumed surrender rates on interest-sensitive life products without secondary guarantees, (ii) an increase in the option budget assumptions for certain fixed-indexed annuities and interest sensitive life products, and (iii) higher surrender rate assumption for certain assumed flow annuity business. \nAmortization of Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) the remeasurement of the policy liabilities associated with certain cost-of-reinsurance asset intangibles during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and (ii) an increase in deferred acquisition costs amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2025 associated with new business volumes generated from individual retirement annuities and preneed insurance.\n139\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates as compared against the comparable prior year quarter.\nInsurance Expenses\nInsurance expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in commission expenses as a result of lower new business volumes in the institutional markets channel.\nGeneral, Administrative, and Other\nGeneral, administrative and other decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased employee compensation expenses.\nOther Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis - Unaudited)\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the higher level of income before taxes attributable to KKR common stockholders. As reported in Note 18 “Income Taxes” KKR’s effective tax rate is 16%. If you are to exclude the reported net income (loss) before taxes not attributable to KKR common stockholders, KKR’s effective tax rate would be 28%. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 18 \"Income Taxes\" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended September 30, 2025, relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to (i) third-party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles and (ii) exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership until they are exchanged for common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to a higher level of net gains from investment activities at our consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc.\nNet income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a higher level of management fees and investment-related net gains attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. from our asset management and strategic holdings operations and a lower level of realized investment losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in our insurance business. These increases were partially offset by a lower level of capital allocation-based income and higher level of income taxes in the current period.\n140\nTable of Contents\nCondensed Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis - Unaudited)\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations on a GAAP basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees earned from Ascendant (our U.S. middle market traditional private equity strategy fund) due to management fees earned on new capital raised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that were retroactive to the start of the fund’s investment period and no such retroactive fees were earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from North America Fund XIII as a result of entering its post-investment period in the second quarter of 2025, and (iii) no management fees earned from Asian Fund II in the current period due to the termination of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nManagement fees due from consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" \nFee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of transaction fees in our Private Equity business line. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. Transaction and monitoring fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit.\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments in many of our unconsolidated carry-earning investment vehicles, most notably Asian Fund IV, North America Fund XIII and our private equity and infrastructure K-Series vehicles. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments in many of our unconsolidated carry-earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, North America Fund XIII, and Global Infrastructure Investors IV.\nKKR calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.\nInvestment Income (Loss) \nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025\nThe net gains from investment activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, were comprised of net realized gains of $601.3 million and net unrealized gains of $2,430.9 million.\nInvestment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) as described above. \n143\nTable of Contents\nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net realized gains related primarily to \nrealized gains on the sales of BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., CyrusOne Inc., and The Citation Group. Partially offsetting these realized gains wer\ne (i) realized losses on certain investments held in consolidated CLOs and (ii) realized losses on our investments in Selecta Group HoldCo. (consumer products sector) and investments held in one of our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net unrealized gains were driven by mark-to-market gains primarily relating to our investment in Exact Holding B.V., USI, Inc. (financial services sector), and IVI-RMA. These unrealized gains were partially offset by (i) unrealized losses on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, (ii) mark-to-market losses primarily relating to our investments in PetVet Care Centers, LLC, and OneStream, Inc., (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above, and (iv) unrealized losses on certain investments held in consolidated CLOs.\nThe factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net gains were primarily generated in the following asset classes:\n•\nPrivate Equity (including core private equity), which were primarily impacted by overall positive operating performance of certain portfolio companies. Changes in market multiples varied across regions / sectors used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments; and\n•\nInfrastructure, which primarily benefited from the overall positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets, partially offset by slightly higher cost of capital assumptions. Changes in market multiples varied across regions / sectors used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments.\nSee \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuation.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nThe net gains from investment activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were comprised of net realized gains of $285.7 million and net unrealized gains of $2,059.8 million. \nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net realized gains related primarily to the (i) realized gains on the sale of FiberCop S.p.A.and BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. and (ii) realized gains on certain foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these realized gains were (i) realized losses on our investments in Unzer GmbH, Qoo10 SG, and Telepizza SAU (consumer products sector) and (ii) realized losses from the distribution of certain assets to third-party fund investors in certain of our consolidated energy funds.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by mark-to-market gains primarily relating to our investments in Exact Holding B.V., OneStream, Inc. and USI, Inc. These unrealized gains were partially offset by (i) mark-to-market losses primarily relating to our investment in Accell Group N.V. (consumer products sector), (ii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above, and (iii) unrealized losses on certain foreign exchange forward contracts.\nThe factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net gains were primarily generated in the following asset classes:\n•\nPrivate Equity (including core private equity), which were primarily impacted by (i) overall positive operating performance of its portfolio companies, and (ii) the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments; and\n144\nTable of Contents\n•\nInfrastructure, which primarily benefited from the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets and to a lesser extent by the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments.\nFor a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" For additional information about net gains (losses) from investment activities, see Note 4 \"Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management and Strategic Holdings\" in our financial statements.\nDividend Income\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, dividend income was primarily from (i) our investments in 1-800 Contacts Inc., April SA, and Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc., all held through our consolidated core vehicles and (ii) various investments in certain of our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, dividend income was primarily from (i) our investments in 1-800 Contacts Inc., Exact Holding B.V., Viridor Limited (infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector), and FiberCop S.p.A., held through our consolidated core investment vehicles, (ii) our investment in MásOrange (telecommunications sector), held through our consolidated European Fund V, and (iii) certain of our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. \nSignificant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" \nInterest Income\nThe decrease in interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates during the current period on floating rate credit investments held in consolidated CLOs and certain of our consolidated private credit funds. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of closing CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to September 30, 2024. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\"\nInterest Expense\nThe decrease in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates during the current period on floating rate debt obligations held in consolidated CLOs and at certain consolidated funds and other investment vehicles. The decrease was partially offset by (i) the impact of closing CLOs that were consolidated subsequent to September 30, 2024, and (ii) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see \"—Key Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures.\"\nExpenses \nCompensation and Benefits \nThe decrease in compensation and benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a lower level of accrued carried interest compensation driven by a lower level of carried interest income earned in the current period, partially offset by accrued discretionary cash compensation resulting from a higher level of asset management fee related segment revenues in the current period.\nOccupancy and Related Charges\nThe increase in occupancy and related charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the commencement of new office leases subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nThe increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a higher level of expenses reimbursable from our unconsolidated investment funds, a higher level of issuance costs from newly formed consolidated CLOs in the current period, and corporate general administrative costs, partially offset by a prior year legal accrual that did not recur in the current period.\n145\nTable of Contents\nCondensed Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis - Unaudited) - Insurance \nRevenues\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, revenues consisted of the following: \n \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nNet Premiums\n$\n2,113,216 \n$\n7,593,534 \n$\n(5,480,318)\nPolicy Fees\n1,013,182 \n1,038,218 \n(25,036)\nNet Investment Income\n5,616,405 \n4,802,226 \n814,179 \nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n(845,386)\n(780,077)\n(65,309)\nOther Income\n202,501 \n180,436 \n22,065 \nTotal Insurance Revenues\n$\n8,099,918\n \n$\n12,834,337\n \n$\n(4,734,419)\nNet Premiums\nNet premiums decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in initial premiums assumed from fewer reinsurance transactions with life contingencies or morbidity risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Offsetting these decreases in part were increases from new premiums earned on direct pension risk transfer and preneed insurance products with life contingencies or morbidity risk. Initial premiums from new business are generally offset by a comparable change in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below under “Expenses—Net policy benefits and claims”). \nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in the institutional and individual market channels as a result of the cumulative impact of new business volumes in the current and preceding quarters, and (ii) higher average portfolio yields. \nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net investment-related gains (losses) were as follows:\n \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nEquity Index Options\n$\n760,717 \n$\n580,358 \n$\n180,359 \nInterest Rate Contracts\n136,767 \n(42,280)\n179,047 \nEquity Futures Contracts\n(45,502)\n(96,312)\n50,810 \nForeign Exchange and Other Derivative Contracts\n(216,287)\n(47,940)\n(168,347)\nFunds Withheld Payable Embedded Derivatives\n(652,789)\n(852,165)\n199,376 \nFunds Withheld Receivable Embedded Derivatives\n(38,612)\n6,592 \n(45,204)\nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\n(55,706)\n(451,747)\n396,041\n \nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\n(789,680)\n(328,330)\n(461,350)\nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n$\n(845,386)\n$\n(780,077)\n$\n(65,309)\n146\nTable of Contents\nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\nThe increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and real asset investments. The underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio increased in value during both the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, resulting in a loss on the related embedded derivative. The increase in fair value of the underlying investments was primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates during both the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, with a smaller relative increase in market interest rates during the prior period.\nThe increase in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the underlying indices. Global Atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). The majority of Global Atlantic's equity index options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased during both the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and an increase in the notional amount of equity market contracts outstanding.\nThe increase in the fair value of interest rate contracts was primarily driven by a decrease in market interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to an increase in market interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a gain on interest rate contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to a loss on interest rate contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe decrease in the fair value of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts was primarily driven by a decrease due to depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and British pound during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net other investment gains (losses) were as follows:\n \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nRealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Not Supporting Asset-Liability Matching Strategies\n$\n43,015 \n$\n16,698 \n$\n26,317 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturity Securities\n(1,577,554)\n(387,975)\n(1,189,579)\nCredit Loss Allowances\n(175,524)\n(288,606)\n113,082 \nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Fixed Maturity Securities Classified as Trading\n601,424 \n471,647 \n129,777 \nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Other Investments Accounted Under a Fair-Value Option and Equity Investments\n63,774 \n(10,100)\n73,874 \nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Real Assets\n45,126 \n(179,759)\n224,885 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Real Assets\n17,757 \n6,787 \n10,970 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Funds Withheld at Interest Payable Portfolio\n80,417 \n50,147 \n30,270 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Funds Withheld at Interest Receivable Portfolio\n(67,488)\n(47,242)\n(20,246)\nForeign Exchange Gains (Losses) on Non-USD Denominated Investments\n223,227 \n56,929 \n166,298 \nOther\n(43,854)\n(16,856)\n(26,998)\nNet Other Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n$\n(789,680)\n$\n(328,330)\n$\n(461,350)\nThe increase in net other investment-related losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to an increase in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities due to low yield trades in the prior period.\nOffsetting these increases in net other investment-related losses in part were (i) an increase in unrealized gains on real assets, and (ii) an increase in foreign exchange gains on non-USD denominated investments due to the greater foreign exchange volatility as a result of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and British pound during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n147\nTable of Contents\nExpenses\nNet Policy Benefits and Claims\nNet policy benefits and claims decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) lower initial reserves assumed related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies or morbidity risk in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) favorable impacts related to the assumption review described below, and (iii) the change in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic’s fixed indexed annuity products as a result of an increase in equity market gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (as discussed above under \"\n—\nConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)\n—\nRevenues\n—\nNet investment-related gains (losses)\". Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains (losses) on derivative instruments, and generally offsets the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims).\nThese decreases were partially offset by (i) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the ordinary-course run-off of older business originated in a low interest rate environment, (ii) new reserves established related to new business originated with life or morbidity risks associated with preneed insurance and direct pension risk transfer products, and (iii) an increase in market risk benefits losses due to a decrease in market interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to an increase in market interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimate of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses, and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter, referred to as an “assumption review.” As Global Atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent Global Atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an “unlocking” impact. Generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, there was a net favorable assumption review impact of $63.9 million on net policy benefits and claims, which was primarily due to (i) higher expected yield assumptions for certain interest-sensitive life products, (ii) favorable expected surrender and persistency assumption changes for certain income annuity, variable annuity, and life insurance products, and (iii) a decrease in expected morbidity assumptions on long-term care riders for certain fixed annuity products, offset in part by (i) higher mortality rate assumptions for certain life insurance products, (ii) a change in the activation assumption related to certain benefit riders on fixed-indexed annuities, and (iii) higher surrender rate assumptions for certain assumed annuity products.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a net favorable assumption review impact of $74.6 million on net policy benefits and claim, which was primarily due to (i) higher assumed mortality rates for guaranteed income riders on fixed-indexed annuities, and (ii) higher assumed interest rate margins on certain interest-sensitive life products due to an increase in assumed reinvestment rates and flat crediting rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by (i) lower assumed surrender rates on interest-sensitive life products without secondary guarantees, (ii) an increase in the option budget assumptions for certain fixed-indexed annuities and interest sensitive life products, and (iii) higher surrender rate assumption for certain assumed flow annuity business. \nAmortization of Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) the remeasurement of the policy liabilities associated with certain cost-of-reinsurance asset intangibles during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an increase in the cost-of-reinsurance asset and a decrease in amortization in the comparative nine month period, and (ii) an increase in deferred acquisition costs amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 associated with new business volumes generated from individual retirement annuities and preneed insurance in preceding periods.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in total debt outstanding.\n148\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Expenses\nInsurance expenses decreased\n \nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in commission expenses as a result of the lower new business volumes in the institutional markets channel.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nGeneral, administrative and other increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased employee compensation expenses.\nOther Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis - Unaudited)\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the lower level of income before taxes attributable to KKR common stockholders. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 18 \"Income Taxes\" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to (i) third-party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles and (ii) exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership until they are exchanged for common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to a higher level of net gains from investment activities at our consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. \nNet income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primary due to a higher level of realized investment losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in our insurance business, which were partially offset by a higher level of investment-related net gains attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. from our asset management and strategic holdings operations and a higher level of asset management fee related income in the current period.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (GAAP Basis - Unaudited)\nPlease see our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition on a GAAP basis as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 in our financial statements included in this report.\nKKR & Co. Inc. Stockholders’ Equity - Common Stock increased from December 31, 2024 primarily due to unrealized gains on available-for sale-securities from Global Atlantic that are recorded in other comprehensive income and net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. common stockholders, which were partially offset by dividends to common and preferred stockholders. \n149\nTable of Contents\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (GAAP Basis - Unaudited)\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. \nThe consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities, which include certain consolidated investment funds, CLOs and certain variable interest entities formed by Global Atlantic notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those investment funds and CFEs. The assets of our consolidated investment funds and CFEs, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, could have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and CFEs involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated investment funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.\nNet Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities\nOur net cash provided (used) by operating activities was $5.4 billion and $6.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our operating activities primarily included: (i) investments purchased (asset management and strategic holdings), net of proceeds from investments (asset management and strategic holdings) of $(2.0) billion and $0.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments (asset management and strategic holdings) of $0.6 billion and $0.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments (asset management and strategic holdings) of $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (iv) capital allocation-based income (loss) (asset management and strategic holdings) of $2.7 billion and $3.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (v) net investment and policy liability-related gains (losses) (insurance) of $(2.7) billion and $(2.5) billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and (vi) interest credited to policyholder account balances (net of policy fees) (insurance) of $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Investment funds are investment companies under GAAP and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value.\nNet Cash Provided (Used) by Investing Activities\nOur net cash provided (used) by investing activities was $(12.0) billion and $(16.8) billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our investing activities primarily included: (i) investments purchased (insurance), net of proceeds from investments (insurance), of $(11.8) billion and $(16.7) billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (ii) acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $(146.3) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and (iii) the purchase of fixed assets of $(126.9) million and $(88.4) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nNet Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities\nOur net cash provided (used) by financing activities was $14.0 billion and $4.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) contributions from, net of distributions to, our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests of $2.3 billion and $(174.5) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (ii) proceeds received, net of repayment of debt obligations, of $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (iii) proceeds from the issuance of Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (net of issuance cost) of $2.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, (iv) additions to, net of withdrawals from, contractholder deposit funds (insurance) of $7.6 billion and $6.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (v) cash consideration for the 2024 GA Acquisition of $(2.6) billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (vi) reinsurance transactions, net of cash provided (insurance) of $47.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (vii) common stock dividends of $(485.1) million and $(456.6) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and (viii) Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock Dividends of $(78.2) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n150\nTable of Contents\nAnalysis of Segment Operating Results\nThe following is a discussion of the results of our business on a segment basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under \"—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures\" and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. See \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations.\nAnalysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results\nThe following tables set forth information regarding KKR's asset management segment operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024: \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nManagement Fees\n$\n1,063,553 \n$\n892,629 \n$\n170,924 \nTransaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\n328,124 \n467,145 \n(139,021)\nFee Related Performance Revenues\n73,177 \n56,655 \n16,522 \nFee Related Compensation\n(256,350)\n(247,875)\n(8,475)\nOther Operating Expenses\n(175,568)\n(167,881)\n(7,687)\nFee Related Earnings\n1,032,936 \n1,000,673 \n32,263 \nRealized Performance Income\n930,659 \n391,920 \n538,739 \nRealized Performance Income Compensation\n(697,994)\n(289,994)\n(408,000)\nRealized Investment Income\n4,436 \n151,546 \n(147,110)\nRealized Investment Income Compensation\n(665)\n(22,732)\n22,067 \nAsset Management Segment Earnings\n$\n1,269,372\n \n$\n1,231,413\n \n$\n37,959\n \nManagement Fees\nThe following table presents management fees by business line:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nManagement Fees\nPrivate Equity\n$\n394,380 \n$\n346,675 \n$\n47,705 \nReal Assets\n350,225 \n265,912 \n84,313 \nCredit and Liquid Strategies\n318,948 \n280,042 \n38,906 \nTotal Management Fees\n$\n1,063,553\n \n$\n892,629\n \n$\n170,924\n \nThe increase in Private Equity management fees was primarily attributable to (i) management fees commencing at North America Fund XIV in the second quarter of 2025 and (ii) management fees earned on new capital raised over the past twelve months at our private equity K-Series vehicles, net of certain revenue sharing arrangements. The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees earned from Ascendant (our U.S. middle market traditional private equity strategy fund) due to management fees earned on new capital raised in the third quarter of 2024 that were retroactive to the start of the fund’s investment period and no such retroactive fees were earned for the three months ended September 30, 2025, (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from North America Fund XIII as a result of entering its post-investment period in the second quarter of 2025, and now paying fees based on invested capital rather than committed capital, and (iii) a lower level of management fees from Americas Fund XII due to a step-down in the management fee rate. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, approximately $5.0 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that were retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period. \n151\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in Real Assets management fees was primarily attributable to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors V, primarily due to management fees earned on new capital raised in the third quarter of 2025 that was retroactive to the start of the fund’s investment period as well as new capital raised over the past twelve months, (ii) management fees earned on new capital raised over the past twelve months at our infrastructure K-Series vehicles, net of certain revenue sharing arrangements, and (iii) a higher level of management fees earned at Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund due to an increase in its fee base from capital inflows and investment appreciation year over year. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors III due to a decrease in invested capital subsequent to the third quarter of 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, approximately $38.9 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period.\nThe increase in Credit and Liquid Strategies management fees was primarily attributable to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Atlantic primarily due to the growth in assets from inflows, (ii) an increase in capital invested in certain alternative credit strategy accounts, which resulted in an increase in its fee base, and (iii) a higher level of management fees earned from CLOs from new issuances in both the US and Europe over the past twelve months.\nTransaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\nThe following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nTransaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\nPrivate Equity\n$\n30,327 \n$\n29,306 \n$\n1,021 \nReal Assets\n20,290 \n11,631 \n8,659 \nCredit and Liquid Strategies\n1,738 \n2,559 \n(821)\nCapital Markets\n275,769 \n423,649 \n(147,880)\nTotal Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\n$\n328,124\n \n$\n467,145\n \n$\n(139,021)\n \nOur Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. For most of our investment funds, transaction and monitoring fees are credited against fund management fees up to 100% of the amount of the transaction and monitoring fees attributable to that investment fund, which results in a decrease of our transaction and monitoring fees. Our Capital Markets business line earns transaction fees, which are generally not shared with fund investors.\nThe decrease in transaction and monitoring fees, net is primarily due to a lower level of transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line. The decrease in Capital Markets business line transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the size of capital markets transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n \nOverall, we completed 114 capital markets transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2025, of which 18 represented equity offerings and 96 represented debt offerings, as compared to 101 capital markets transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2024, of which 19 represented equity offerings and 82 represented debt offerings. We earn fees in connection with underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes.\nOur capital markets fees are generated in connection with activity involving our private equity, real assets, and credit business lines as well as from third-party companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 16% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to 10% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 41% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 48% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.\n152\nTable of Contents\n See \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results—Capital Invested\" for more information about capital invested by business line.

The amount of realized investment income depends on the transaction activity of our funds and Asset Management segment balance sheet, which can vary from period to period.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, realized investment income was primarily comprised of (i) interest income primarily from our investment in CLOs and (ii) realized gains from the sale of our investments in Kokusai Electric Corporation and Metronet Holdings, LLC (infrastructure: telecommunications infrastructure sector). Offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which were (i) a realized loss related to a structured multi-asset investment vehicle and (ii) realized losses from the sale of various revolving credit facilities.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, realized investment income was primarily comprised of (i) interest income primarily from our investment in CLOs, (ii) realized gains primarily from the sale of our investments in Kokusai Electric Corporation and BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., and (iii) dividend income primarily from our investments in Crescent Energy Company (NYSE: CRGY) (“Crescent”) and KREST.

Partially offsetting the increase were distributions to fund investors primarily as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from Asian Fund IV, Asian Fund III, and North America Fund XI.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, the value of our traditional private equity investment portfolio increased 2%. This was comprised of a 3% increase in value of our privately held investments and a 4% decrease in share prices of publicly held investments. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the value of our growth equity and core private equity investment portfolio both increased 2%.\n156\nTable of Contents\nThe most significant increases in the value of our privately held investments were increases in Omnissa, LLC (technology sector), Global Medical Response, Inc. (healthcare sector), and Internet Brands, Inc. (technology sector). These increases were partially offset by decreases in the value of certain other privately held investments, the most significant of which were PetVet Care Centers, LLC, Kareway Health (healthcare sector), and NetSPI, LLC (technology sector). The increased valuations of our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance and an increase in the value of market comparables for investments that had an increase in value during the current period. The decreased valuations of our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to an unfavorable business outlook by the companies that had a decrease in value during the current period. See \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations.\nThe most significant decreases in share prices of our publicly held investments were decreases in OneStream, Inc., NIQ Global Intelligence PLC (NYSE: NIQ), and Gambol Pet Group Co. Ltd. (SHE: 301498). These decreases were partially offset by increases in share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were BrightSpring Health Services Inc. (NASDAQ: BTSG) and ZJLD Group, Inc. (HKG: 6979). The prices of publicly held companies may experience volatile changes following the reporting period.

Partially offsetting the increase were (i) distributions to fund investors as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from one of our infrastructure co-investment vehicles and Global Infrastructure Investors III, and (ii) payments to Global Atlantic policyholders.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, the value of our infrastructure portfolio increased 3% and our real estate equity investment portfolio remained flat. \nThe most significant increases in value across our Real Assets portfolio were increases in the values of Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc., Nxera (infrastructure: power and utilities sector), and CyrusOne Inc. These increases were partially offset by decreases in value across our real assets portfolio, the most significant of which was Depot Connect International (infrastructure: transportation sector). The increased valuations across our real assets portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company or asset performance.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, 84% of capital deployed was in transactions in North America, 15% was in Europe, and 1% was in the Asia-Pacific region.\n161\nTable of Contents\nAnalysis of Insurance Segment Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth information regarding KKR's insurance segment operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nNet Investment Income\n$\n1,835,025 \n$\n1,636,300 \n$\n198,725 \nNet Cost of Insurance\n(1,305,073)\n(1,166,891)\n(138,182)\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\n(225,299)\n(230,889)\n5,590 \nInsurance Operating Earnings\n$\n304,653\n \n$\n238,520\n \n$\n66,133\n \nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management from the cumulative impact of new business volume growth, and (ii) higher average portfolio yields.\nNet Cost of Insurance\nNet cost of insurance increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) growth in reserves in the institutional and individual market channels as a result of the cumulative impact of new business volumes in the current and preceding quarters, and (ii) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the routine run-off of older business originated in a lower interest rate environment. \nNet cost of insurance for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily reflects a $41.0 million favorable impact from annual assumption review changes (as discussed above under \n—\nConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)\n—\nNet Policy Benefits and Claims) due to (i) higher expected yield assumptions for certain interest-sensitive life products, and (ii) favorable expected surrender and persistency assumption changes for certain variable annuity and life insurance products, offset in part by (i) higher mortality rate assumptions for certain life insurance products, and (ii) higher surrender rate assumptions for certain assumed annuity products.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in interest expenses as a result of a decrease in market interest rates as compared against the comparable prior year quarter.\nInsurance Operating Earnings\nInsurance operating earnings increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in net investment income due to an increase in average assets under management and higher portfolio yields and the favorable impact of assumption review, all partially offset by an increase in net cost of insurance due to the cumulative impact of new business volume growth and higher crediting rates.\n162\nTable of Contents\nAnalysis of Strategic Holdings Segment Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth information regarding KKR's strategic holdings segment operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024: \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nDividends, Net\n$\n57,663 \n$\n6,828 \n$\n50,835 \nStrategic Holdings Operating Earnings\n57,663 \n6,828 \n50,835 \nNet Realized Investment Income\n69,861 \n87,693 \n(17,832)\nStrategic Holdings Segment Earnings\n$\n127,524\n \n$\n94,521\n \n$\n33,003\n \nDividends, Net\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, dividends, net were comprised of dividend income from 1-800 Contacts.

The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees earned from Ascendant (our U.S. middle market traditional private equity strategy fund) due to management fees earned on new capital raised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that were retroactive to the start of the fund’s investment period and no such retroactive fees were earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from North America Fund XIII as a result of entering its post-investment period in the second quarter of 2025, and now paying fees based on invested capital rather than committed capital, and (iii) no management fees earned from Asian Fund II in the current period due to the termination of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, approximately $5.0 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that were retroactive to the start of the relevant fund’s investment period. \nThe increase in Real Assets management fees was primarily attributable to (i) management fees commencing at Global Infrastructure Investors V in the third quarter of 2024, (ii) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Atlantic primarily due to the growth in assets from inflows, and (iii) management fees earned on new capital raised over the past twelve months at our infrastructure K-Series vehicles, net of certain revenue sharing arrangements. The increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors III due to a decrease in invested capital subsequent to the third quarter of 2024 and (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors IV as a result of entering its post-investment period in the third quarter of 2024, and now paying fees based on invested capital rather than committed capital.

For most of our investment funds, transaction and monitoring fees are credited against fund management fees up to 100% of the amount of the transaction and monitoring fees attributable to that investment fund, which results in a decrease of our monitoring and transaction fees. Our Capital Markets business line earns transaction fees, which are generally not shared with fund investors.\nThe decrease in transaction and monitoring fees, net is primarily due to a lower level of transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line. The decrease in capital markets transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the size of capital markets transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Overall, we completed 318 capital markets transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, of which 40 represented equity offerings and 278 represented debt offerings, as compared to 285 transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 43 represented equity offerings and 242 represented debt offerings. We earn fees in connection with underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes.\nOur capital markets fees are generated in connection with activity involving our private equity, real assets, and credit business lines as well as from third-party companies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 18% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 15% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 51% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.\n166\nTable of Contents\nFee Related Performance Revenues\nThe following table presents fee related performance revenues by

Approximately 45% of the realizations are driven by revenues that correspond to a 10-20% compensation rate. We expect this realized performance income and realized investment income to be reduced by $346 million as a result of an Asian Fund II clawback obligation that we expect to realize in the fourth quarter of 2025. On a net basis, after giving effect to carried interest distributions already recouped from current and former employees, we expect the clawback obligation to reduce fourth quarter 2025 net realized performance income by $210 million. See “—Liquidity—Sources of Liquidity” for additional information.

Partially offsetting the increase were (i) the release of capital commitments related to one of our strategic partnerships, and (ii) distributions to fund investors primarily as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from Asian Fund IV and Asian Fund III. \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the value of our traditional private equity investment portfolio increased by 11%. This was comprised of a 10% increase in share prices of publicly held investments and a 11% increase in value of our privately held investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the value of our growth equity investment portfolio increased 9%, and the value of our core private equity investment portfolio increased 4%. \nThe most significant increases in the value of our privately held investments were increases in Seiyu Group, Omnissa, LLC, and IVI-RMA Global, S.L.

These increases in value of our privately held investments were partially offset by decreases in the value of certain other privately held investments, the most significant of which were PetVet Care Centers, LLC, Goodpack Limited, and Magneti Marelli CK Holdings Co., Ltd. (industrials sector). The increased valuations of our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables for investments that had an increase in value during the current period, and (iii) with respect to Seiyu Group, an increase in valuation reflecting an agreement to exit the investment, which was executed in the third quarter of 2025. The decreased valuations of our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to an unfavorable business outlook by the companies that had a decrease in value during the current period. See \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations.\nThe most significant increases in share prices of our publicly held investments were increases in BrightSpring Health Services Inc., Kokusai Electric Corporation, and Hyundai Marine Solutions (KRX: 443060). These increases were partially offset by decreases in share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were OneStream, Inc., J.B.

The increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which was partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period. \nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nAs of September 30, 2025, our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line had $33.0 billion of remaining uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $21.4 billion as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which was partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.\nCapital Invested\nPrivate Equity\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, $15.2 billion of capital was invested by our Private Equity business line, as compared to $9.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a $3.9 billion increase in capital invested in our core private equity strategy and a $1.4 billion increase in capital invested in our traditional private equity strategy. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, 47% of capital deployed in private equity was in transactions in North America, 29% was in Europe, and 24% was in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of large private equity investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods.\nReal Assets\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, $19.2 billion of capital was invested by our Real Assets business line, as compared to $21.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

NRSRO and NAIC ratings have different methodologies. Global Atlantic believes the NAIC ratings methodology, which considers the likelihood of recovery of amortized cost as opposed to the recovery of all contractual payments including the principal at par, as the more appropriate way to view the ratings quality of its AFS fixed maturity portfolio since a large portion of its holdings were purchased at a significant discount to par value. The portion of Global Atlantic's investment portfolio consisting of floating rate assets was 28% and 25% as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nWithin the funds withheld receivable at interest portfolio, 97% of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade by NAIC designation as of both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nTrading fixed maturity securities primarily back funds withheld payable at interest where the investment performance is ceded to reinsurers under the terms of the respective reinsurance agreements.\nCredit Quality of AFS Fixed Maturity Securities\nThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the AFS fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called “NAIC designations.” Using an internally developed rating is permitted by the NAIC if no rating is available. These designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of NRSROs for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. NAIC designations of “1,” highest quality, and “2,” high quality, include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade by NRSROs. NAIC designations “3” through “6” include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade by NRSROs.\nConsistent with the NAIC Process and Procedures Manual, a NRSRO rating was assigned based on the following criteria: (1) the equivalent S&P rating where the security is rated by one NRSRO; (2) the equivalent S&P rating of the lowest NRSRO when the security is rated by two NRSROs; and (3) the equivalent S&P rating of the second lowest NRSRO if the security is rated by three or more NRSROs. If the lowest two NRSROs’ ratings are equal, then such rating will be the assigned rating. NRSROs’ ratings available for the periods presented were S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, DBRS, Inc., and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nSubstantially all of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, 93% and 95% as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, was invested in investment grade assets with a NAIC rating of 1 or 2.\nThe portion of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio that was considered below investment grade by NAIC designation was 7% and 5% as of September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. Pursuant to Global Atlantic's investment guidelines, Global Atlantic actively monitors the percentage of its portfolio that is held in investments rated NAIC 3 or lower and must obtain an additional approval from Global Atlantic's management investment committee before making a significant investment in an asset rated NAIC 3 or lower.\n179\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Fixed Maturity Securities\nGlobal Atlantic maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 60% and 55% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in corporate fixed maturity securities, respectively. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, approximately 6% and 5% of the portfolio is denominated in foreign currency, respectively. \nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 91% and 94% of the total fair value of corporate fixed maturity securities is rated NAIC investment grade, respectively, and 91% and 94% is rated NRSROs investment grade, respectively.\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 14% and 13% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in RMBS, respectively. RMBS are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages and backed by payments from those pools. Excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, Global Atlantic would expect prepayments of principal on the underlying loans to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in market interest rates.\nThe NAIC designations for RMBS, including prime, sub-prime, alt-A, and adjustable rate mortgages with variable payment options (\"Option ARM\"), are based upon a comparison of the bond’s amortized cost to the NAIC’s loss expectation for each security. Accordingly, an investment in the same security at a lower cost may result in a higher quality NAIC designation in recognition of the lower likelihood the investment would result in a realized loss. Prime residential mortgage lending includes loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime, which also includes certain non-qualified mortgages. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the business of originating residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weaker credit profiles.\nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 91% and 84% of RMBS securities that are below investment grade as rated by the NRSRO, carry an NAIC 1 (\"highest quality\") designation, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2025, Alt-A, Agency, Option ARM, Prime and Sub-prime represent 36%, 34%, 10%, 8% and 5% of the total RMBS portfolio ($12.3 billion), respectively. As of December 31, 2024, Alt-A, Agency, Option ARM, Sub-prime, and Re-Performing represent 44%, 20%, 15%, 8%, and 6% of the total RMBS portfolio ($10.3 billion), respectively.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses for AFS Fixed Maturity Securities\nGlobal Atlantic's investments in AFS fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes and offsets. Unrealized gains and losses can be created by changes in interest rates or by changes in credit spreads.\nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic had gross unrealized losses on below investment grade AFS fixed maturity securities of $333.5 million and $584.3 million based on NRSRO ratings, and $163.0 million and $245.6 million based on NAIC ratings, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, unrealized losses were not recognized in net income on these fixed maturity securities since Global Atlantic neither intends to sell the securities nor does it believe that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost or amortized cost basis. \nCredit Quality of Mortgage and Other Loan Receivables\nMortgage and other loan receivables consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and other loan receivables. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 28% and 31% of Global Atlantic's total investments consisted of mortgage and other loan receivables, respectively. \nGlobal Atlantic invests in U.S. mortgage loans, comprised of first lien and mezzanine commercial mortgage loans and first lien residential mortgage loans. For Global Atlantic’s commercial mortgage loan portfolio, the most prevalent property type is multi-family residential buildings, which represents approximately half of the portfolio as of both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Office and retail properties represent approximately 19% and 20% of the portfolio as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nGlobal Atlantic's commercial mortgage loans are assigned NAIC designations, with designations “CM1” and “CM2” considered to be investment grade. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 92% and 91% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio were rated investment grade based on NAIC designation, respectively. The payment status of over 99%  of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is current as of both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. \n180\nTable of Contents\nThe loan-to-value ratio is expressed as a percentage of the current amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying collateral. As of both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, approximately 90% of the commercial mortgage loans have a loan-to-value ratio of 70% or less, and as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 2% and 1% have loan-to-value ratio over 90%, respectively.\nChanging economic conditions and updated assumptions affect Global Atlantic’s assessment of the collectibility of commercial mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the analysis that Global Atlantic performs to measure the allowance for credit losses. In addition, Global Atlantic continuously monitors its commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have exposure to specific geographic events or have deteriorating credit.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the payment status of 97% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is current, and approximately $199.5 million is 90 days or more past due or in process of foreclosure (representing 1% of the total residential mortgage portfolio). As of December 31, 2024, the payment status of 97% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was current and approximately $275.1 million were 90 days or more past due or in process of foreclosure (representing 1% of the total residential mortgage portfolio).\nThe weighted average loan-to-value ratio for residential mortgage loans was 63% as of both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nGlobal Atlantic's residential mortgage loan portfolio primarily includes mortgage loans backed by single family rental properties, prime loans, and re-performing loans that were purchased at a discount after they were modified and returned to performing status. Global Atlantic has also extended financing to counterparties in the form of repurchase agreements secured by mortgage loans, including performing and non-performing mortgage loans. \nGlobal Atlantic’s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of home improvement loans, residential solar loans, student loans, and auto loans. As of September 30, 2025, 98% of the consumer loan portfolio is in current status and approximately $29.3 million is 90 days or more past due or in process of foreclosure (representing 1% of the total consumer loan portfolio).\nAdditional Information\nTo provide supplemental information to stockholders about the net assets of KKR on a segment basis, KKR’s book value was $32.2 billion as of September 30, 2025, which included cash and short-term investments of $7.6 billion. KKR's book value includes its net investment in Global Atlantic, investments in the Asset Management and Strategic Holdings segments, and the net impact of certain other assets and liabilities, including income taxes. KKR's book value excludes the net assets allocable to investors in KKR’s investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders. From January 1, 2025 through September 30, 2025, the Asset Management segment transferred $1.1 billion of investments to the Insurance segment for which no gain or loss was recognized.\n181\nTable of Contents\nReconciliations to GAAP Measures \nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co.

The overall liquidity framework and cash management approach of our insurance business are also based on seeking to build an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from insurance assets that meet our insurance companies' expected cash outflows to pay their liabilities. Our primary cash flow activities typically involve (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as through the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and CLOs; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding capital commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and any holders of our preferred stock, if any; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowing arrangements. See \"—Liquidity,\" \"—Liquidity Needs,\" and \"—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.\" \nSee \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations.\nSources of Liquidity \nOur primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in CLOs; (iv) in our insurance business, cash inflows in respect of new premiums, policyholder deposits, reinsurance transactions, and funding agreements, including through memberships in FHLBs; (v) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments or other assets for fund formations (including CLOs and other investment vehicles); and (vi) borrowings, including advances under our revolving credit facilities, debt offerings, repurchase agreements, and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from issuances of our or our subsidiaries' equity securities. We have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. For a discussion of our debt obligations, including our debt securities, revolving credit agreements and loans, see Note 16 \"Debt Obligations\" in our financial statements.\nMany of our investment funds like our private equity and real assets funds provide for carried interest. With respect to our carry-paying investment funds, carried interest is eligible to be distributed to the general partner of the fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. Even after all of the preceding conditions are met, the general partner of the fund may, in its sole discretion, decide to defer the distribution of carried interest to it to a later date. In addition, these funds generally include what is called a “clawback” provision, which provides that the general partner must return any carried interest that is paid in excess of what the general partner is entitled to receive at the end of the term of the fund, as discussed further below.\n184\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2025, certain of our investment funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a \"netting hole.\" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. Strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership. As of September 30, 2025, netting holes in excess of $50 million existed at North America Fund XI and Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II in the amounts of $550 million and $53 million, respectively. The remaining unrealized gains in each of these funds as of September 30, 2025 is in excess of these netting holes. In accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. \nIf the investment fund has distributed carried interest but subsequently does not have sufficient value to provide for the distribution of carried interest at the end of the life of the investment fund, the general partner is typically required to return previously distributed carried interest to the fund investors. Current and former employees who received distributions of carried interest subject to clawback would be required to return the amount of such distributions to KKR. However, it is KKR’s obligation to return carried interest subject to clawback to the fund investors. As of September 30, 2025, approximately $514 million of previously distributed carried interest, in aggregate, was subject to a clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry-paying investment funds were liquidated at their fair value as of September 30, 2025. The Asian Fund II clawback obligation as of the date of this report comprises $346 million of this amount and is expected to be realized in the fourth quarter of 2025. On a net basis, after giving effect to carried interest distributions already recouped from current and former employees, we expect the Asian Fund II clawback obligation to reduce fourth quarter 2025 net realized performance income by $210 million. The remaining clawback obligation of $168 million relates to clawback obligations of carry-paying investment funds other than Asian Fund II. As of September 30, 2025, Asian Fund II is the only investment fund subject to a clawback obligation in excess of $50 million that has not already reduced net realized performance income. As of September 30, 2025, $103 million of the $168 million has already reduced gross realized performance income in prior periods. See Note 24 \"Commitments and Contingencies—Contingent Repayment Guarantees\" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. See also the negative amounts included in the Carried Interest column in the table included in this Item 2 in “Asset Management—Private Equity” for further information on clawback obligations.\nLiquidity Needs\nWe expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to meet various obligations, including, without limitation, to:\n•\ncontinue to support and grow our asset management business, including seeding new investment strategies, supporting capital commitments made by our investment vehicles to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies and otherwise supporting the investment vehicles that we sponsor;\n•\ncontinue to support and grow our insurance business;\n•\ncontinue to support and grow our strategic holdings business;\n•\ngrow and expand our businesses generally, including by acquiring or launching new, complementary, or adjacent businesses;\n•\nwarehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or CLOs or other investment vehicles pending the contribution of committed capital by the fund investors in such investment vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;\n185\nTable of Contents\n•\nservice debt obligations including the payment of obligations at maturity, on interest payment dates or upon redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities, including from litigation, that may give rise to future cash payments, including funding requirements to levered investment vehicles or structured transactions;\n•\nfund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including for litigation matters and guarantees;\n•\npay corporate income taxes and other taxes;\n•\npay policyholders and amounts in our insurance business related to investment, reinvestment, reinsurance, or funding agreement activity;\n•\npay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement;\n•\npay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our common stock or the terms of our preferred stock, if any;\n•\nunderwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds, and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business;\n•\npost or return collateral in respect of derivative contracts;\n•\nacquire other assets (including businesses, investments, and other assets) for our businesses, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for CLOs (to the extent they may apply); \n•\naddress capital needs of regulated subsidiaries as well as non-regulated subsidiaries; and\n•\nrepurchase shares of our common stock or retire equity awards pursuant to the share repurchase program or repurchase or redeem other securities issued by us.\nFor a discussion of KKR's share repurchase program, see Note 22 \"Equity\" in our financial statements.\nCapital Commitments\nThe agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with the asset allocation strategy in our Principal Activities business line, and in our Strategic Holdings segment.\n186\nTable of Contents\n \nAs of September 30, 2025, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of $10.4 billion to its investment funds and other investment vehicles across Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. These unfunded commitments include $2.7 billion of uncalled capital commitments to certain investment vehicles in connection with investments in the core private equity strategy. These unfunded commitments also include funding requirements to levered investment vehicles and structured transactions to fund or otherwise be liable for a portion of the vehicle's investment losses and/or to provide the vehicle with liquidity upon certain termination events. \nIn addition to these uncalled commitments and funding obligations to KKR's investment funds and investment vehicles, KKR has entered into contractual commitments primarily with respect to underwriting transactions, debt financing, revolving credit facilities, and equity syndications in our Capital Markets business line. As of September 30, 2025, these capital markets commitments amounted to $0.5 billion. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such capital markets commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. From time to time, we fund these various capital markets commitments noted above in our capital markets business by drawing all or substantially all of our availability for borrowings under our available credit facilities available for our Capital Markets business line. We generally expect these borrowings by our capital markets business to be repaid promptly as these commitments are syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment. Additionally, KKR's capital markets business has arrangements with third parties, which are expected to reduce KKR's risk under certain circumstances when underwriting certain debt transactions. As a result, our unfunded capital markets commitments as of September 30, 2025 have been reduced to reflect the amount expected to be funded by such third parties. As of September 30, 2025, KKR's capital markets business line has entered into such arrangements representing a total notional amount of $5.0 billion. For more information about our Capital Markets business line's risks, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our capital markets activities expose us to material risks\" in our Annual Report. \nTax Receivable Agreement\nOn May 30, 2022, KKR terminated the tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings other than with respect to exchanges of KKR Holdings Units completed prior to such date. As of September 30, 2025, an undiscounted payable of $355.5 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed for certain exchanges of KKR Holdings Units that took place prior to the termination of the tax receivable agreement. As of September 30, 2025, $129.4 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement since inception.\nDividends and Stock Repurchases \nA dividend of $0.185 per share of our common stock has been declared and will be paid on December 2, 2025 to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on November 17, 2025.\nA dividend of $0.78125 per share of Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has been declared and set aside for payment on December 1, 2025 to holders of record of Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as of the close of business on November 15, 2025.\nWhen KKR & Co. Inc. receives distributions from KKR Group Partnership, holders of exchangeable securities receive their pro rata share of such distributions from KKR Group Partnership. \nThe declaration and payment of dividends to our common or preferred stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. We announced on February 4, 2025 that our current dividend policy will be to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an annual aggregate amount of $0.74 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per share) beginning with the dividend announced with the results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including KKR’s future financial performance and other considerations that the Board of Directors deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of KKR & Co. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for U.S. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our common stock or our preferred stock will be maintained. Furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by KKR Group Partnership and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements.\n187\nTable of Contents\nSince 2015, KKR has repurchased, or retired equity awards representing, a total of 94.2 million shares of common stock for $2.8 billion, which equates to an average price of $29.36 per share. For further information, see \"Part II—Item 2—Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\" \nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds and CFEs enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. Contractual arrangements include (1) commitments to fund the purchase of investments or other assets (including obligations to fund capital commitments as the general partner of our investment funds) or to fund collateral for derivative transactions or otherwise, (2) obligations arising under our senior notes, subordinated notes, and other indebtedness, (3) commitments by our capital markets business to underwrite transactions or to lend capital, (4) obligations arising under insurance policies written, (5) other contractual obligations, including servicing agreements with third-party administrators for insurance policy administration, and (6) commitments to fund the business, operations or investments of our subsidiaries. In addition, we may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. For more information about these contingent liabilities, please see Note 24 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in our financial statements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business.\n188\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, investment income (loss) and income taxes during the reporting periods. Such estimates include but are not limited to (i) the valuation of investments and financial instruments, (ii) the determination of the income tax provision, (iii) the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, (iv) the impairment of available-for-sale investments, (v) the valuation of insurance policy liabilities, including market risk benefits, (vi) the valuation of embedded derivatives in policy liabilities and funds withheld, (vii) the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and (viii) amortization of deferred revenues and expenses associated with the insurance business. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. \nFor a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in our financial statements included in this report. \nBasis of Accounting\nWe consolidate the financial results of KKR Group Partnership and its consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment advisers, broker-dealers, Global Atlantic’s insurance companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated investment funds, general partners of consolidated investment funds and their respective consolidated investment funds, and certain other entities including CFEs.\nWhen an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows, and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of an investment fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of Net Income Attributable to KKR or KKR's stockholders' equity that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under GAAP. This is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe presentations in the consolidated statement of financial condition and consolidated statement of operations reflect the significant industry diversification of KKR by its acquisition of Global Atlantic. Global Atlantic operates an insurance business, and KKR operates an asset management business, which manages the operations of the newly-formed Strategic Holdings segment (see Note 21 \"Segment Reporting\") in our financial statements included in this report, each of which possess distinct characteristics. As a result, KKR developed a two-tiered approach for the financial statements presentation, where Global Atlantic's insurance operations are presented separately from KKR's asset management business. KKR believes that these separate presentations provide a more informative view of the consolidated financial position and results of operations than traditional aggregated presentations and that reporting Global Atlantic’s insurance operations separately is appropriate given, among other factors, the relative significance of Global Atlantic’s policy liabilities, which are not obligations of KKR (other than the insurance companies that issued them). If a traditional aggregate presentation were to be used, KKR would expect to eliminate or combine several identical or similar captions, which would condense the presentations, but would also reduce the level of information presented. KKR also believes that using a traditional aggregate presentation would result in no new line items compared to the two-tier presentation included in the financial statements in this report.\nIn the ordinary course of business, KKR’s Asset Management, Strategic Holdings, and Insurance businesses enter into transactions with each other, which may include transactions pursuant to their investment management agreements and financing arrangements. The borrowings from these financing arrangements are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets pledged to support such borrowings. All the investment management and financing arrangements amongst KKR segments are eliminated in consolidation.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n189\nTable of Contents\nConsolidation\nKKR consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. For a detailed description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in our financial statements included in this report. \nAs part of its consolidation procedures, KKR evaluates: (1) whether it holds a variable interest in an entity, (2) whether the entity is a VIE, and (3) whether the KKR’s involvement would make it the primary beneficiary. The determination that KKR holds a controlling financial interest in an investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\n The assessment of whether we consolidate an investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with an investment vehicle and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: \n•\nDetermining whether our management fees, carried interests, or incentive fees represent variable interests - We make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. In making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the VIE. \n•\nDetermining whether a legal entity qualifies as a VIE - For those entities where KKR holds a variable interest, management determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a VIE and, if so, whether or not KKR is the primary beneficiary. The assessment of whether the entity is a VIE is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. These judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties’ equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity. Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. Under the voting interest entity model, KKR consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. \n•\nConcluding whether KKR has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE - As there is no explicit threshold in GAAP to define “potentially significant,” we must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met.\nChanges to these judgments could result in a change in the consolidation conclusion for a legal entity.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. \nGAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel I\nPricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. \nLevel II\nPricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.\n190\nTable of Contents\nLevel III\nPricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. The valuation of our Level III investments at September 30, 2025 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nLevel III Valuation Methodologies\nOur investments and financial instruments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the carried interest and investment income we realize. Additionally, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. \nThere is inherent uncertainty involved in the valuation of Level III investments, and there is no assurance that, upon liquidation, KKR will realize the values reflected in our valuations. Our valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. See \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations. \nKey unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III valuations as described above are included in Note 9 \"Fair Value Measurements\" in our financial statements.\nAcross the total Level III private equity investment portfolio (including core private equity investments) held directly and through both consolidated and unconsolidated investment vehicles in our Asset Management segment, the overall weights ascribed to a market comparables valuation methodology, the discounted cash flow valuation methodology, and a valuation methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of Level III private equity investments (including core private equity investments) were 41%, 53%, and 6%, respectively, as of September 30, 2025.\nAcross the total Level III real assets investment portfolio held directly and through both consolidated and unconsolidated investment vehicles in our Asset Management segment, the overall weights ascribed to a market comparables valuation methodology, the discounted cash flow valuation methodology, the direct income capitalization valuation methodology, and a valuation methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of Level III real assets investments were 4%, 92%, 2%, and 2%, respectively, as of September 30, 2025.\n191\nTable of Contents\nLevel III Valuation Process\nThe valuation process involved for Level III measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.\nFor private equity and real asset investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies, and other factors. KKR begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its Level III assets approximately one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and KKR follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its Level III assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. These preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations annually for all Level III private equity and real asset investments and quarterly for investments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 1% of the total value of KKR's Level III private equity and real asset investments. The valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by independent valuation firms without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firms rely on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. For credit investments, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by KKR to assist with the valuations of most investments classified as Level III. The valuation firm either provides a value, provides a valuation range from which KKR's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the valuation, or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations. After reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by KKR's valuation committees. As of September 30, 2025, less than 5% of the total value of our Level III credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.\nFor Level III investments in Asset Management and Strategic Holdings, KKR has a Global Valuation Committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. The Global Valuation Committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core equity investments and certain impact investments), growth equity (including certain impact investments), real estate, energy, infrastructure, and credit. The asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary Level III valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. The members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance, and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments. All Level III valuations for investments in Asset Management and Strategic Holdings are also subject to approval by the Global Valuation Committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes KKR's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer. Once Level III valuations are approved by the Global Valuation Committee, a presentation of such valuations is provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and then to the Board of Directors.\nLevel III investments held by Global Atlantic are valued using either pricing services, broker-dealers, third-party asset managers, or internal models. Global Atlantic's valuation committee performs a quantitative and qualitative analysis over all pricing sources used to verify that it represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. As of September 30, 2025, less than 5% of the total value of Global Atlantic's Level III investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm. Once Level III valuations are approved by the Global Atlantic Valuation Committee, these valuations are presented to the Global Valuation Committee, and then a presentation of such valuations is provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and then to the Board of Directors.\nAs of September 30, 2025, upon completion by, where applicable, independent valuation firms of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain Level III investments, the independent valuation firms concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR (including Global Atlantic), of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all Level III investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. \n192\nTable of Contents\nAs described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs, and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time.\nChanges in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly in Asset Management, Strategic Holdings, and through our consolidated funds as described below. We estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. With respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our ownership in the consolidated investment funds and investment vehicles. With respect to Insurance, a decrease in investment income for certain assets where investment gains and losses are recognized through the statement of operations would impact KKR only to the extent of our economic ownership interest in Global Atlantic.\nAs of September 30, 2025, there were no investments (including in our Strategic Holdings segment) which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a GAAP basis. Our investment income on a GAAP basis and our asset management segment assets can be impacted by volatility in the public markets. See \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report and \"—Business Environment\" for a discussion of factors that may impact the valuations of our investments, financial results, operating results, and valuations, and \"—Segment Balance Sheet Measures\" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a segment basis.\nBusiness Combinations\nKKR accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. \nManagement’s determination of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date is based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involve a significant degree of judgment. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and outflows, future fundraising assumptions, expected useful life, discount rates, and income tax rates. Our estimates for future cash flows are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying assets acquired. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset. We base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual result.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties, and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that KKR uses to manage its business. Revisions in estimates or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. Please see Note 18 \"Income Taxes\" in our financial statements in this report for further details. \n193\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Asset Management and Strategic Holdings\nRevenues\nFees and Other\nFees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, CLOs, other investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; and (v) consulting fees. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.\nTransaction fee calculations and management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital typically do not require discretion and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the investment vehicles. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions.\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\nCapital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from those arrangements whereby KKR serves as general partner and includes income or loss from KKR's capital interest as well as \"carried interest\" which entitles KKR to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from an investment fund's limited partners. \nCarried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds’ investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in their partnership agreement. KKR recognizes revenues attributable to capital allocation-based income based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized reflects KKR’s share of the gains and losses of the associated funds’ underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. Because of the inherent uncertainty in measuring the fair value of investments in the absence of observable market prices as previously discussed, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. \nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and Benefits expense includes (i) base cash compensation consisting of salaries and wages, (ii) benefits, (iii) carry pool allocations, (iv) equity-based compensation, and (v) discretionary cash bonuses.\nTo supplement base cash compensation, benefits, carry pool allocations, and equity-based compensation, we typically pay discretionary cash bonuses, which are included in Compensation and Benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, based principally on the level of (i) management fees and other fee revenues (including incentive fees), (ii) realized carried interest, and (iii) realized investment income earned during the year. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our sole discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus. We accrue discretionary cash bonuses when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable which is generally in the period when we make the decision to pay discretionary cash bonuses and is based upon a number of factors, including the recognition of fee revenues, realized carried interest, realized investment income, and other factors determined during the year.\n194\nTable of Contents\nBeginning in 2021, we expect to pay our employees by assigning a percentage range to each component of asset management segment revenues. Prior to January 1, 2024, based on the current components and blend of our asset management segment revenues on an annual basis, we expected to use approximately: (i) 20‐25% of fee related revenues, (ii) 60‐70% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10‐20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees, to pay our asset management employees. Beginning in January 2024, we expect to use approximately: (i) 15%-20% of fee related revenues, (ii) 70%-80% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10%-20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees, to pay our asset management employees. Because these ranges are applied to applicable asset management segment revenue components independently, and on an annual basis, the amount paid as a percentage of total asset management segment revenue will vary and will, for example, likely be higher in a period with relatively higher realized carried interest and lower in a period with relatively lower realized carried interest. We decide whether to pay a discretionary cash bonus and determine the percentage of applicable revenue components to pay compensation only upon the occurrence of the realization event. There is no contractual or other binding obligation that requires us to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the asset management employees, except in limited circumstances.\nCarry Pool Allocation\nWith respect to our funds that provide for carried interest, we allocate a portion of the realized and unrealized carried interest that we earn to Associates Holdings, which we refer to as the carry pool, from which our asset management employees and certain other carry pool participants are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation. The allocation is determined based upon a fixed arrangement between Associates Holdings and us, and we do not exercise discretion on whether to make an allocation to the carry pool upon a realization event. We refer to the portion of carried interest that we allocate to the carry pool as the carry pool percentage.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 40%, 43%, or 65% by investment fund, depending on the fund’s vintage. For funds that closed after December 31, 2020 but before December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 65%. For funds that closed after June 30, 2017 but before December 31, 2020, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 43%, and the carry pool percentage was fixed at 40% for older funds that contributed to KKR's carry pool. Effective January 2, 2024, KKR is authorized to apply a carry pool percentage in excess of these fixed percentages of up to 80% for all funds. \nThis increase to the carry pool percentage was approved by a majority of KKR's independent directors, and the carry pool percentage may not be increased above 80% without the further approval of a majority of KKR's independent directors. For funds that closed after December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage is fixed at 80%. For funds that closed prior to December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage is calculated at a fixed percentage of 40%, 43%, or 65% (depending on the fund’s vintage) for carried interest realized up to a high water mark, which was established based on the unrealized carried interest balance that existed on January 2, 2024, plus an additional percentage amount up to 80% based on a formulaic allocation, only if the unrealized carried interest balance at any period end exceeds the high water mark. This imposes a limitation of the carry pool allocation for such funds based on the amount of cumulative unrealized carried interest income earned subsequent to December 31, 2023. \nFor funds that closed before December 31, 2023, if the cumulative carried interest subsequent to December 31, 2023 is not sufficient to fund this formulaic allocation, the allocation of earnings reverts to the carry pool percentage in effect before this modification. As such, upon modification of the carry pool percentage effective on January 2, 2024, the cumulative unrealized carried interest was not sufficient to fund the additional formulaic allocation percentage in excess of the pre-existing 40%, 43%, and 65% carry pool percentages, and therefore no incremental expense was recognized as of such date. The carry pool percentage applicable for all funds that closed prior to December 31, 2023 will not be less than their applicable carry pool percentages of 40%, 43%, or 65% prior to December 31, 2023, and will not be more than 80%. The intent of this modification is that for all funds that closed prior to January 2, 2024, upon the final liquidation of each fund, realized carried interest distributed will equal the historical fund carry pool allocations up to the high water mark and only distributions of realized carried interest in excess of the high water mark will be distributed at 80 percent if and only if the unrealized carried interest balance at any period end exceeds the high water mark. Under no circumstance would a distribution of carried interest exceed 80% of the total allocable carried interest at any time.\nKKR accounts for the carry pool as a compensatory profit-sharing arrangement in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and it is recorded as compensation expense. The liability that is recorded in each period reflects the legal entitlement of Associates Holdings at each point in time should the total unrealized carried interest be realized at the value recorded at each reporting date. Upon a reversal of carried interest income, the related carry pool allocation, if any, is also reversed. Accordingly, such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments.\n195\nTable of Contents\nOn the Sunset Date (which will not be later than December 31, 2026), KKR will acquire control of Associates Holdings and will commence making decisions regarding the allocation of the carry proceeds pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of Associates Holdings. Until the Sunset Date, our Co-Founders will continue to make decisions regarding the allocation of the carry proceeds to themselves and others, pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of Associates Holdings, provided that any allocation of carry proceeds to the Co-Founders will be on a percentage basis consistent with past practice. For additional information about the Sunset Date and the Reorganization Agreement, see Note 1 \"Organization\" in our financial statements included in this report.\nEquity-based Compensation\nIn addition to the cash-based compensation and carry pool allocations as described above, employees receive equity awards under our Equity Incentive Plans, most of which are subject to service-based vesting typically over a three to five-year period from the date of grant, and some of which are also subject to the achievement of market-based conditions. Certain of these awards are subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements.\nCompensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards is measured at fair value on the grant date. In determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments as to the grant-date fair value, particularly for certain restricted units with a vesting condition based upon market conditions, whose grant date fair values are based on a probability distributed Monte-Carlo simulation. See Note 19 \"Equity Based Compensation,” in our financial statements included in this report for further discussion and activity of these awards.\nInvestment Income (Loss) - Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see above \"—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Fair Value Measurements.\"\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Insurance\nPolicy Liabilities\nPolicy liabilities, or collectively, “reserves,” are the portion of past premiums or assessments received that are set aside to meet future policy and contract obligations as they become due. Interest accrues on the reserves and on future premiums, which may also be available to pay for future obligations. Global Atlantic establishes reserves to pay future policy benefits, claims, and certain expenses for its life policies and annuity contracts.\nGlobal Atlantic’s reserves are estimated based on models that include many actuarial assumptions and projections. These assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgment, including assumptions as to the levels and/or timing of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), mortality, longevity, and persistency.\nThe assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves at least annually. Global Atlantic cannot, however, determine with precision the amount or the timing of actual benefit payments. If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves would be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required to meet future policy and contract obligations. This would result in a charge to Global Atlantic's net income during the period in which excess benefits are paid or an increase in reserves occurs.\n196\nTable of Contents\nFor a majority of Global Atlantic’s in-force policies, including its interest-sensitive life policies and most annuity contracts, the base policy reserve is equal to the account value. For these products, the account value represents Global Atlantic’s obligation to repay to the policyholder the amounts held with Global Atlantic on deposit. However, there are several significant blocks of business where policy reserves, in addition to the account value, are explicitly calculated, including variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, interest-sensitive life products (including those with secondary guarantees), and preneed policies. \nMarket Risk Benefits\nMarket risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the policyholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose Global Atlantic to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits include certain contract features on fixed annuity and variable annuity products, including minimum guarantees to policyholders, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (\"GMDBs\"), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (\"GMWBs\"), and long-term care benefits (which are capped at the return of account value plus one or two times the account value).\nSome of Global Atlantic's variable annuity and fixed-indexed annuity contracts contain a GMDB feature that provides a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount, even if the account balance is reduced to zero. This amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary, or sometimes a combination of these values. If the GMDB is higher than the current account value at the time of death, Global Atlantic incurs a cost equal to the difference.\nGlobal Atlantic issues fixed-indexed annuity and variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature. GMWB are an optional benefit where the contract owner is entitled to withdraw a maximum amount of their benefit base each year.\nOnce exercised, living benefit features provide annuity policyholders with a minimum guaranteed stream of income for life. A policyholder’s annual income benefit is generally based on an annual withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base. The benefit base is defined in the policy and is generally the initial premium, reduced by any partial withdrawals and increased by a defined percentage, formula, or index credits. Any living benefit payments are first deducted from the account value. Global Atlantic is responsible for paying any excess guaranteed living benefits still owed after the account value has reached zero.\nThe ultimate cost of these benefits will depend on the level of market returns and the level of contractual guarantees, as well as policyholder behavior, including surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit utilization. For Global Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity products, costs also include certain non-guaranteed terms that impact the ultimate cost, such as caps on crediting rates that Global Atlantic can, in its discretion, reset annually. \nSee Note 17 “Policy Liabilities” in our financial statements for additional information.\n197\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2025, the net market risk liability balance totaled $1.3 billion. As of September 30, 2025, the liability balances for market risk benefits were $1.1 billion for fixed-indexed annuities and $186.0 million for variable and other annuities. The increase (decrease) to the net market risk benefit liability balance as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, instrument-specific credit risk, equity market prices, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below.

The liabilities for these benefits are included in policy liabilities. Global Atlantic elected the fair value option to measure the liability for certain of these variable annuity contracts valued at $268.4 million as of September 30, 2025. Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated death benefits less the present value of the GMDB fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. Global Atlantic discounts the cash flows using the U.S. Treasury rates plus an adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the liabilities for these benefits is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2025, variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option totaled $268.4 million. The increase (decrease) in the reserves for variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, instrument-specific credit risk, equity market prices, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below.

The liability is estimated using current assumptions that include mortality, morbidity, lapses, and expenses. These current assumptions are based on judgments that consider Global Atlantic’s historical experience, industry data, and other factors, and are updated quarterly and the current period change in the liability is recognized as a separate component of benefit expense in the consolidated income statement. \nAs of September 30, 2025, the liability for future policy benefits totaled $13.1 billion, net of reinsurance, split between $11.4 billion associated with payout annuity products, and $1.8 billion of life and other insurance products (including assumed long-term care insurance where Global Atlantic retroceded mortality and morbidity risks to a third-party reinsurer). The increase (decrease) as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, credit spreads, expected mortality, and expected surrenders and lapses are summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.\nAs of September 30, 2025\nPayout Annuities\nOther\n($ in thousands)\nBalance\n$\n11,376,604\n \n$\n1,757,865\n \nHypothetical Change:\n+50 bps Interest Rates\n(195,969)\n(394,067)\n-50 bps Interest Rates\n210,176 \n424,057 \n+50 bps Credit Spreads\n(161,885)\n(278,606)\n-50 bps Credit Spreads\n167,673 \n289,816 \n95% of Expected Mortality\n(1)\n74,871 \n38,438 \n105% of Expected Mortality\n(1)\n(71,139)\n(36,578)\n90% of Expected Surrenders/Lapses\n— \n(10,116)\n110% of Expected Surrenders/Lapses\n— \n9,152 \nNote: Hypothetical changes to the liability for future policy benefits balance do not reflect the impact of related hedges.\n(1)\nIncludes decrements for terminations of disability insurance.\nAdditional Liability for Annuitization, Death, or Other Insurance Benefits: No-Lapse Guarantees\nGlobal Atlantic has in-force interest-sensitive life contracts where it provides a secondary guarantee to the policyholder. The policy can remain in-force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met. The primary risk to Global Atlantic is that the premium collected under these policies, together with the investment return Global Atlantic earns on that premium, is ultimately insufficient to pay the policyholder’s benefits and the expenses associated with issuing and administering these policies. Global Atlantic holds an additional reserve in connection with these guarantees.\nThe additional reserves related to interest-sensitive life products with secondary guarantees are calculated using methods similar to those described above under “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Insurance—Policy Liabilities—Market Risk Benefits.” The costs related to these secondary guarantees are recognized over the life of the contracts through the accrual and subsequent release of a reserve which is revalued each period. The reserve is calculated based on assessments, over a range of economic scenarios to incorporate the variability in the obligation that may occur under different environments. The change in the reserve is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the additional liability balance of primarily interest-sensitive life totaled $6.1 billion, net of reinsurance. The increase (decrease) to the additional liability balance, as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, equity market prices, annual equity growth, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of the interest-sensitive life no-lapse guarantee liability balance.\n199\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2025\nInterest-Sensitive Life\n($ in thousands)\nBalance\n$\n6,100,256\n \nHypothetical Change:\n+50 bps Interest Rates\n1,700 \n-50 bps Interest Rates\n(1,700)\n+10% Equity Market Prices\n(1,700)\n-10% Equity Market Prices\n900 \n1% Lower Annual Equity Growth\n6,700 \n95% of Expected Mortality\n(48,800)\n105% of Expected Mortality\n48,300 \n90% of Expected Surrenders\n21,700 \n110% of Expected Surrenders\n(21,300)\nNote: Hypothetical changes to the interest-sensitive life additional liability for annuitization, death, or other insurance benefits balance do not reflect the impact of related hedges.\nEmbedded Derivatives in Policy Liabilities and Funds Withheld\nGlobal Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity, variable annuity, and indexed universal life products contain equity-indexed features, which are considered embedded derivatives and are required to be measured at fair value.\nGlobal Atlantic calculates the embedded derivative as the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using an option budget as the indexed account value growth rate. In addition, the fair value of the embedded derivative is reduced to reflect instrument specific credit risk on Global Atlantic's obligation (that is, Global Atlantic's own credit risk).\nChanges in interest rates, future index credits, instrument-specific credit risk, projected withdrawal and surrender activity, and mortality on fixed-indexed annuity and interest-sensitive life products can have a significant impact on the value of the embedded derivative.\nValuation of Embedded Derivatives – Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nFixed-indexed annuity contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate of return or a market indexed strategy where interest credited is based on the performance of an index, such as the S&P 500 Index, or other indexes. The market indexed strategy is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The fair value of the embedded derivative is computed as the present value of benefits attributable to the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values. The projections of policy contract values are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates, and policyholder behavior. The projections of minimum guaranteed contract values include the same assumptions for policyholder behavior as are used to project policy contract values. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate increased by instrument-specific credit risk tied to Global Atlantic's own credit rating. \nValuation of Embedded Derivatives – Interest-Sensitive Life Products\nInterest-sensitive life products allow a policyholder’s account value to grow based on the performance of certain equity indexes, which results in an embedded derivative similar to a call option. The embedded derivative related to the index is bifurcated from the host contract and measured at fair value. The valuation of the embedded derivative is the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using the option budget as the indexed account value growth rate and the guaranteed interest rate as the guaranteed account value growth rate. Present values are based on discount rate curves determined at the valuation date or issue date as well as assumed lapse and mortality rates. The discount rate equals the forecast treasury rate increased by instrument-specific credit risk tied to Global Atlantic’s own credit rating. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions such as spreads and/or option budgets can have a substantial impact on the embedded derivative.\n200\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Embedded Derivatives in Modified Coinsurance or Funds Withheld\nGlobal Atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements that include terms that require payment by the ceding company of a principal amount plus a return that is based on a proportion of the ceding company’s return on a designated portfolio of assets. Because the return on the funds withheld receivable or payable is not clearly and closely related to the host insurance contract, these contracts are deemed to contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at fair value. Global Atlantic is exposed to both the interest rate and credit risk of the assets. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions can have a significant impact on this embedded derivative. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is included in the funds withheld receivable at interest and funds withheld payable at interest line items on our consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in net investment-related gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the embedded derivative liability balance totaled $7.1 billion for fixed-indexed annuities, and $481.5 million for interest-sensitive life. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity market prices are summarized in the table below.
