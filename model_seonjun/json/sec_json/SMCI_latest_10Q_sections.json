Founded and operating in San Jose, California, we are committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. As a Total IT Solutions manufacturer, our offerings include server, artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems, storage, IoT devices, switches, software, and support services. Supermicro's expertise in motherboard, power, and chassis design drives our ability to develop and produce next-generation innovations, from cloud to edge, for our global customers. Our products are designed and manufactured in-house across facilities in the United States, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. Leveraging our global operations for scale and efficiency, we optimize solutions to improve TCO while reducing environmental impact through Green Computing initiatives. Our award-winning portfolio of Server Building Block Solutions empowers customers to tailor systems precisely to their exact workloads and applications. By selecting from a broad family of flexible and reusable building blocks, customers can configure a comprehensive range of form factors, processors, memory, GPUs, storage, networking, power, and cooling solutions, including air-conditioned, free air, and liquid cooling solutions.\nWe commenced operations in 1993 and have been profitable every year since inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, our net income was $168.3 million and $424.3 million, respectively.\nIn order to increase our sales and profits, we believe that we must continue to develop flexible application optimized server and storage solutions while being among the first to market with new features and products. Our focus is on delivering Total IT Solutions that integrate, validate, and deliver server, storage, networking and software at the rack and cluster (multi-rack) level. Additionally, we will continue to expand our software offerings and enhance customer service and support, particularly as we increase our focus on large enterprise and data center customers. A key component of our strategy is our DCBBS, which significantly reduces data center build time and enables full integration of AI computing, server, storage, networking, rack, cabling, liquid cooling, end-to-end management software, onsite deployment services, and ongoing maintenance. To further expand our market share, we also recognize the need to strengthen our network of sales partners and distribution channels.\nWe measure our financial success based on various key indicators, including growth in net sales, gross profit margin, operating margin, and net income per common share. In addition to these financial metrics, a critical non-financial indicator of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application-optimized server and storage solutions. To support this, we work closely with the developers and manufacturers of key components, allowing us to integrate emerging technologies as they become available. Our ability to quickly bring new products to market, which we believe is enabled by our Building Block Solution architecture and has historically enabled us to capitalize on major technology transitions such as the launch of new GPUs, microprocessors and storage technologies. Accordingly, we closely monitor the product introduction cycles of industry leaders, including NVIDIA Corporation, Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Broadcom Inc., Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Micron Technology, Inc. and others. This strategic focus directly informs our research and development investments, as we continue to allocate resources toward both our current initiatives and future product innovation.\nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 33\nTable of Contents\nAI and Data Centers \nThe growing use of AI, which requires enhanced datacenter capabilities, has substantially increased demand for our products. We expect this trend to continue, with further demand for datacenter expansion driven by the AI market. As a result, we will continue to enhance our product capabilities and expand our service offerings, including DCBBS to address the growing demand in the AI market and datacenter markets. We believe that our ability to tailor certain products to the unique needs of these sectors sets us apart from many competitors and positions us to capture an even greater market share going forward.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have had and may continue to have direct and indirect impacts on our business and results of operations, particularly demand for our products and net sales. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors have also impacted and may continue to impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Further, while many of these macroeconomic factors could have a long term impact, others may have a short term impact which could lead to our financial results not being comparable on a period-to-period basis.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following is a summary of our financial highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n5,017,790 \n$\n5,937,256 \nGross profit\n$\n467,373 \n$\n775,580 \nTotal operating expenses\n$\n285,117 \n$\n266,381 \nIncome from operations\n$\n182,256 \n$\n509,199 \nNet income\n$\n168,285 \n$\n424,327 \nNet income per diluted share\n$\n0.26 \n$\n0.67 \n•\nNet sales decreased by 15.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the timing of several substantial customer orders received only in late September, which prevented the related GPU and SuperRack products from being shipped within the quarter. The decrease also reflects changes in product mix and a modest reduction in average selling prices as we continued to price our products competitively.\n•\nGross margin decreased to 9.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 13.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to our strategy to offer competitive pricing to gain market share, change in product and customer mix, and higher manufacturing related expenses.\n•\nOperating expenses increased by 7.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher headcount and increases in salary and stock-based compensation.\n•\nNet income decreased to $168.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $424.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to decrease in gross profit and increase in operating and other expenses.\n \nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 34\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we regularly evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. \nResults of Operations\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales primarily consist of sales of our server and storage solutions, including systems and related services, subsystems, and accessories. The key factors that impact net sales of our server and storage systems are the number of servers and racks sold, as well as the average selling prices per server or rack. For subsystems and accessories, the main drivers of net sales are the number of units shipped and the average selling price per unit. The prices for our server and storage systems can vary widely depending on the configuration, including factors such as speed, functionality and performance of key components, including CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, cooling systems, and memory. Similarly, the prices for our subsystems and accessories fluctuate depending on the relative value of the specific item being purchased, such as power supplies, server boards, chassis or other accessories.\nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 35\nTable of Contents\nCost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of sales primarily consists of the costs to manufacture our products, which includes: the costs of components and materials, contract manufacturing, shipping, personnel expenses (salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses), equipment and facility expenses, warranty costs and inventory reserve charges.\nWe use several suppliers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture subsystems in accordance with our specifications, with most final assembly and testing performed at our manufacturing facilities in the region where our products are sold. We work with Ablecom, one of our key contract manufacturers and a related party, for our chassis and certain other components. We also outsource a significant part of the manufacturing of certain components, particularly power supplies, to Compuware, also a related party. We also collaborate on design and development activities with Ablecom and Compuware, where we substantially fund the design costs and retain the intellectual property rights. Our purchases of products from Ablecom and Compuware combined represented 3.4% and 4.6% of cost of sales on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For further details on our dealings with related parties, see Note 10, “Related Party Transactions” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of personnel expenses including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our research and development personnel, as well as product development costs such as materials and supplies, consulting services, third-party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to our research and development activities.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our sales and marketing personnel, cost for trade shows, sales representative fees and marketing programs. From time to time, we receive marketing development funding from certain suppliers. Under these arrangements, we are reimbursed for certain marketing costs that we incur as part of the joint promotion of our products and those of our suppliers. These amounts offset a portion of the related expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported sales and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs, including personnel expenses such as salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our general and administrative personnel, financial reporting, corporate governance and compliance, outside legal, audit, tax fees, insurance and credit losses on accounts receivable.\nOther Income, Net and Interest Expense\nOther income, net and interest expense consists primarily of interest earned on our investments and cash balances, interest incurred on our debt, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur income tax provision is based on our taxable income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which primarily include the United States, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits, certain non-deductible expenses, tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income, and stock-based compensation.\nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 36\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents certain items of our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (in millions):\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n5,017.8 \n$\n5,937.3 \nCost of sales\n4,550.4 \n5,161.7 \nGross profit\n467.4 \n775.6 \nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development \n173.3 \n132.2 \nSales and marketing\n47.9 \n68.9 \nGeneral and administrative\n63.9 \n65.3 \nTotal operating expenses\n285.1 \n266.4 \nIncome from operations\n182.3 \n509.2 \nOther income, net \n51.2 \n7.2 \nInterest expense\n(24.9)\n(17.4)\nIncome before income tax provision\n208.6 \n499.0 \nIncome tax provision\n(40.2)\n(74.7)\nShare of loss from equity investee, net of taxes\n(0.1)\n— \nNet income\n$\n168.3 \n$\n424.3 \nThe following table presents certain items of our condensed consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales\n90.7 \n%\n86.9 \n%\nGross profit\n9.3 \n%\n13.1 \n%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development \n3.5 \n%\n2.2 \n%\nSales and marketing\n1.0 \n%\n1.2 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n1.3 \n%\n1.1 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n5.8 \n%\n4.5 \n%\nIncome from operations\n3.5 \n%\n8.6 \n%\nOther income, net \n1.0 \n%\n0.1 \n%\nInterest expense\n(0.5)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nIncome before income tax provision\n4.0 \n%\n8.4 \n%\nIncome tax provision\n(0.8)\n%\n(1.3)\n%\nShare of loss from equity investee, net of taxes\n— \n%\n*\n— \n%\n*\nNet income\n3.2 \n%\n7.1 \n%\n \n*Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 37\nTable of Contents\nNets Sales\nThe following table presents net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nNet sales\n$\n5,017.8 \n$\n5,937.3 \n$\n(919.5)\n(15.5)\n%\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe \n$919.5 million\n or \n15.5% decrease in net sales was primarily due to the timing of several substantial orders, which were only received in late September, such that the products covered by those orders could not be shipped during the quarter ended September 30, 2025. This was caused principally by customer configuration upgrades and delays in data center readiness. A decrease in our average selling price compared to the prior quarter ended September 30, 2024 also contributed modestly to the decline in net sales of server and storage systems, as we maintained our strategy of pricing our products competitively to retain and or gain market shares. This was most pronounced in declining billings for GPU & Super Racks of $527.8 million or 11.7% year over year, including liquid-cooled and air-cooled servers that are generally more complex and of higher average selling price. Additionally, sales across other product categories decreased by $349.9 million, or 28.5%, including Traditional Storage, SuperBlade, Ultra Server, and other product lines. \nNets Sales by Geography\nThe\n following table presents net sales by geographic region for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nUnited States\n$\n1,834.5 \n$\n4,241.3 \n$\n(2,406.8)\n(56.7)\n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n36.6 \n%\n71.4 \n%\nAsia\n$\n2,318.3 \n$\n954.6 \n$\n1,363.7 \n142.9 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n46.2 \n%\n16.1 \n%\nEurope\n$\n716.3 \n$\n645.9 \n$\n70.4 \n10.9 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n14.3 \n%\n10.9 \n%\nOthers\n$\n148.7 \n$\n95.5 \n$\n53.2 \n55.7 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n2.9 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n5,017.8 \n$\n5,937.3 \n$\n(919.5)\n(15.5)\n%\nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 38\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe $919.5 million or 15.5% decrease in total net sales was primarily driven by the timing of several substantial customer orders that were received only in late September, which prevented the related products including GPU servers, HPC systems, and rack-scale solutions, which generally have higher average selling prices, from being shipped during the quarter ended September 30, 2025. This was caused principally by customer configuration upgrades and delays in data center readiness. The decrease also reflects a shift in product mix and a modest reduction in average selling prices as we continued to price our products competitively to retain and gain market share. This impact was most notable in the United States, where net sales decreased by $2,406.8 million, or 56.7%, compared to the prior quarter ended September 30, 2024. \nCost of Sales, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin\nCost of sales and gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nCost of sales\n$\n4,550.4\n$\n5,161.7\n$\n(611.3)\n(11.8)\n%\nGross profit\n$\n467.4\n$\n775.6\n$\n(308.2)\n(39.7)\n%\nGross margin\n9.3 \n%\n13.1 \n%\n(3.8)\n%\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe $611.3 million or 11.8% decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by a net decrease of approximately  $754.5 million or 14.1% in certain products including GPU servers, HPC, and rack-scale solutions, consistent with the lower shipment volume during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from the timing of several substantial orders that were received near the end of the quarter and therefore could not be fulfilled. This was caused principally by customer configuration upgrades and delays in data center readiness. This decrease was partially offset by a $91.3 million or 29.8% decrease in vendor rebates, a $42.1 million or 398.3% increase in tariff expenses driven by new trade policies, as well as a $27.4 million or 299.3% increase in inventory write-down adjustments from aged inventory.\nThe 3.8% decrease in the gross margin percentage was due to a change in product and customer mix.\nOperating Expenses \nOperating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nResearch and development\n$\n173.3\n$\n132.2\n$\n41.1 \n31.1 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n3.5 \n%\n2.2 \n%\nSales and marketing\n$\n47.9\n$\n68.9\n$\n(21.0)\n(30.5)\n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n1.0 \n%\n1.2 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n63.9\n$\n65.3\n$\n(1.4)\n(2.1)\n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n1.3 \n%\n1.1 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n285.1\n$\n266.4\n$\n18.7 \n7.0 \n%\nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 39\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nResearch and development expenses.\n The $41.1 million or 31.1% increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by an increase in employee-related costs of $41.7 million, or 33.4%, mainly comprised of a $20.9 million, or 57.2%, increase in stock-based compensation, and $17.8 million, or 22.0%, increase in salaries, as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent. These increases along with other immaterial cost increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million, or 29.3%, increase in research and development fees received from certain suppliers and customers.\nSales and marketing expenses.\n The $21.0 million or 30.5% decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by a $19.9 million, or 289.3%, decrease in advertising and promotion expenses due to a marketing reimbursement of $17.2 million, or 291.6%, received from certain business partners for reimbursed product release and promotion efforts, and a $8.9 million, or 34.7%, decrease in sales commission bonuses during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases along with other minor cost decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee-related costs, mainly due to a $4.5 million, or 21.7%, increase in salaries and a $3.3 million, or 43.0%, increase in stock-based compensation, similarly to our research and development expenses as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent company-wide.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. \nThe $1.4 million or 2.1% decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $6.8 million or 63.3%  reduction in audit and tax fees, driven by an absence of additional costs related to the delayed filing of our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, and a $2.1 million or 68.8% reduction in excise tax expense driven by decrease in sales compared to prior-year quarter which reduced the related tax expense. These reductions were partially offset by a $2.1 million or 39.3% increase in consulting fees, driven by greater use of external consultants to support and enhance our financing activities and other initiatives. Additionally, there was a $3.6 million or 30.3% net increase in employee-related costs including salaries, bonus, and stock-based compensation as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent, and a $1.9 million or 6.2% increase in facilities costs such as rental costs, utility costs, and indirect depreciation costs, which are related to our efforts to expand our production capacity in order to support growing customer demands.\nOther Income, Net and Interest Expense\nOther income, net and interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nOther income, net\n$\n51.2 \n$\n7.2 \n$\n44.0 \n611.1 \n%\nInterest expense\n(24.9)\n(17.4)\n(7.5)\n43.1 \n%\nOther income, net and interest expense\n$\n26.3 \n$\n(10.2)\n$\n36.5 \n(357.8)\n%\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe $44.0 million or 611.1% increase in other income, net was primarily driven by higher interest income and favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This is mainly comprised of an increase of $43.3 million or 543.2% in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting increased cash deposits funded by the proceeds from our convertible notes issuance, a $6.5 million or 459.6% gain from mark-to-market adjustments on a marketable equity securities investment, and a $4.4 million or 1687.7% from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from a stronger U.S. dollar in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. These gains were partially offset by a $12.0 million impairment  loss related to our non-marketable investment during the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nThe $7.5 million or 43.1% increase in interest expense was primarily driven by a $21.9 million or 1187.3% increase in interest and amortization related to the amendment of the 2029 Convertible Notes and new issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes and the 2030 Convertible Notes during the second half of fiscal 2025. This increase was partially offset by a $13.9 million or 94.1% decrease in interest expense associated with our Bank of America line of credit and term loans, which were fully repaid in November 2024.\nSMCI | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 40\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision and effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nIncome tax provision\n$\n(40.2)\n$\n(74.7)\n$\n34.5 \n(46.2)\n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n(0.8)\n%\n(1.3)\n%\nEffective tax rate \n(19.3)\n%\n(15.0)\n%\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nIncome tax provision decreased by $34.5 million or 46.2% primarily due to a decline in worldwide income before income tax provision that reduced tax expense by $58.4 million which was offset by a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation of approximately $14.5 million, and the effects of other immaterial tax items of approximately $9.4 million. The income before income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was $208.6 million, which is a decrease of $290.5 million or 58.2%.\nOur quarterly effective income tax rate is based on the estimated annual income tax rate forecast and discrete tax items recognized in the period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025, is higher than that for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a significant decrease in stock-based compensation tax deduction and lower research tax credit because of lower stock vesting price in the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our growth primarily with funds generated from operations, as well as utilizing borrowing facilities, selling our common stock, and issuing convertible notes. Recent drivers of liquidity changes included an increase in the need for working capital due to higher levels of inventory required to support future growing revenues, greater requests for longer payment terms from customers due to increasing system costs and to a lesser extent longer supply chain lead times on certain key components. Our cash and cash equivalents were $4.2 billion and $5.2 billion as of September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held in foreign locations was\n \n$974.2 million\n a\nnd $607.2 million as of September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, respectively. \nAmounts held outside of the United States are typically used to meet non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of these funds are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax, though state income or foreign withholding taxes may apply. In cases where local restrictions prevent the intercompany transfer of funds, our strategy is to retain cash balances outside the U.S. and meet liquidity needs through operating cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes on the repatriation of amounts held outside the U.S. to materially affect our overall liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, borrowing capacity available from our credit facilities and internally generated cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating businesses and maturing debt and interest payments for the 12 months following the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.
