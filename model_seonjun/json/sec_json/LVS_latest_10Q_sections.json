Certain statements in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are forward-looking statements.  See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOperations\nWe view each of our Integrated Resort properties as an operating segment.  Our operating segments in Macao consist of The Venetian Macao; The Londoner Macao; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao; and the Sands Macao.  Our operating segment in Singapore is Marina Bay Sands. \nMacao\nThe Macao government announced total visitation from mainland China to Macao increased approximately 16.9% and 18.4%\n, \nrespectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024.  The Macao government also announced gross gaming revenue increased 12.5% and 7.1%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in \n2024\n.\nSingapore\nAirlift passenger movement has increased with a total of 52 million passengers having passed through Singapore’s Changi Airport for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of 4.4% compared to the same period in \n2024\n.\nThe Singapore Tourism Board (“STB”) announced total visitation to Singapore was 4.5 million and 12.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of 3.0% and 2.3% from the same periods in \n2024\n.\nSummary\nOur Macao operations continue to face a competitive casino operating environment, with adjusted property EBITDA having increased $16 million compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024 and having decreased $54 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOur Singapore operations continue to deliver exceptional results in terms of adjusted property EBITDA, having increased $337 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $601 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with the key driver being an increase in gross gaming revenue.  \nWe have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $3.35 billion as of September 30, 2025 and access to $1.50 billion, $2.51 billion and $456 million of available borrowing capacity from our 2024 LVSC Revolving Facility, 2024 SCL Revolving Facility and 2025 Singapore Revolving Facility, respectively.  We believe we are able to support our continuing operations, complete the major construction projects that are underway and maintain our share repurchase and dividend programs to continue to return excess capital to stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor a discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” presented in our 2024 \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n filed on February 7, 2025.\nThere were no newly identified significant accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, nor were there any material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2024 Annual Report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee related disclosure at “Item 1 — Financial Statements — Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 1 — Organization and Business of Company — Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”\n31 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nOperating Results\nKey Operating Revenue Measurements\nOperating revenues at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao and Marina Bay Sands are dependent upon the volume of patrons who stay at the hotel, which affects the price charged for hotel rooms and our gaming volume.  Operating revenues at Sands Macao are principally driven by the volume of gaming patrons who visit the property on a daily basis. \nManagement utilizes the following volume and pricing measures in order to evaluate past performance and assist in forecasting future revenues.  The various volume measurements indicate our ability to attract patrons to our Integrated Resorts.  In casino operations, win and hold percentages indicate the amount of revenue to be expected based on volume.  In hotel operations, average daily rate and revenue per available room indicate the demand for rooms and our ability to capture that demand.  In mall operations, base rent per square foot indicates our ability to attract and maintain profitable tenants for our leasable space.\nThe following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues:\nCasino revenue measurements for Macao and Singapore: \nMacao and Singapore table games are segregated into two groups: Rolling Chip play (composed of VIP players) and Non-Rolling Chip play (mostly non-VIP players).  The volume measurement for Rolling Chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost.  The volume measurement for Non-Rolling Chip play is table games drop (“drop”), which is net markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop boxes and gaming chips purchased and exchanged at the cage.  Rolling Chip and Non-Rolling Chip volume measurements are not comparable as they are two distinct measures of volume.  The amounts wagered and lost for Rolling Chip play are substantially higher than the amounts dropped for Non-Rolling Chip play.  Slot handle, also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited.\nWe view Rolling Chip win as a percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold (amount won by the casino) as a percentage of slot handle.  Win or hold percentage represents the percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue.  Our win and hold percentages are calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis.  Our Rolling Chip table games are expected to produce a win percentage of 3.3% in Macao.  During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we revised our expected hold-adjusted win percentage for Singapore to be based on the theoretical hold percentage measured by technology-enabled tables (“smart tables”).  The theoretical hold percentage based on smart table data was 4.2% and 3.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, in Singapore.  Our Non-Rolling Chip table games have produced a trailing 12-month win percentage of 23.5%, 22.8%, 21.6%, 23.9%, 15.7% and 23.1% at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, Sands Macao and Marina Bay Sands, respectively.  Our slot machines have produced a trailing 12-month hold percentage of 3.7%, 3.8%, 3.8%, 2.4%, 2.9% and 4.2% at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, Sands Macao and Marina Bay Sands, respectively.  Actual win and hold percentages may vary from our expected win percentage and the trailing 12-month win and hold percentages.  Generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis.  In Macao and Singapore, 8.8% and 11.3%, respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nHotel revenue measurements: \nPerformance indicators used are occupancy rate (a volume indicator), which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period and average daily room rate (“ADR,” a price indicator), which is the average price of occupied rooms per day.  Available rooms exclude those rooms unavailable for occupancy during the period due to renovation, development or other requirements.  The calculations of the occupancy rate and ADR include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis.  Revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) represents a summary of hotel ADR and occupancy.  Because not all available rooms are occupied, ADR is normally higher than RevPAR.  Reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit, or where guests check out early, may be re-sold to walk-in guests.\nMall revenue measurements: \nOccupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators.  Occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area (“GLOA”) divided by gross leasable area (“GLA”) at the end of the reporting period.  GLOA is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent.  GLA does not include space currently under development or not on the market for lease.  Base rent per square foot is the weighted average base or minimum rent charge in effect at the end of the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy.  Tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period.  Only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.\n32 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nSummary Financial Results \nNet revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025, were $3.33 billion, compared to $2.68 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  Operating income was $719 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $504 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  Net income was $491 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $353 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  \nOperating Revenues\nOur net revenues consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nPercent\nChange\n(Dollars in millions)\nCasino\n$\n2,506 \n$\n1,936 \n29.4 \n%\nRooms\n374 \n314 \n19.1 \n%\nFood and beverage\n165 \n152 \n8.6 \n%\nMall\n199 \n189 \n5.3 \n%\nConvention, retail and other\n87 \n91 \n(4.4)\n%\nTotal net revenues\n$\n3,331 \n$\n2,682 \n24.2 \n%\nConsolidated net revenues were $3.33 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $649 million compared to $2.68 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases of $514 million and $135 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  \nNet casino revenues increased $570 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases of $477 million and $93 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  Casino revenues at Marina Bay Sands increased due to overall increases in win and hold percentages, as well as increases in table games and slot volumes.  Casino revenues at our Macao operations increased due to increases in the Non-Rolling Chip drop and win percentage and slot handle, partially offset by decreases in Rolling Chip volume and slot win percentage.

The increase was primarily driven by increases of $233 million in casino expenses, $57 million in loss on disposal or impairment of assets, $44 million in depreciation and amortization, $17 million in development, and $23 million in provision for credit losses.\nCasino expenses increased $233 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases of $131 million and $102 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  The increase at Marina Bay Sands was primarily attributable to a $120 million increase in gaming taxes, consistent with increased gross gaming revenues and an increase in gaming tax rates from 8% to 12% on premium play during most of the third quarter due to the tiered tax structure in Singapore as our thresholds were met in July 2025 versus November 2024.  The increase at our Macao operations was primarily attributable to increased gaming taxes of $60 million due to increased gross gaming revenues, as well as increases in casino marketing and payroll and related expenses. \nRoom expenses increased $10 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases of $7 million and $3 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, consistent with increased business volume and higher costs driven by the conversion of the Sheraton towers to the Londoner Grand in Macao and higher costs associated with new and elevated suites and rooms introduced at Marina Bay Sands.\nFood and beverage expenses increased $15 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases of $9 million and $6 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  These increases were primarily due to the opening of venues since the second half of 2024 and increases in payroll and business volumes.\nProvision for credit losses was $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to recovery of credit losses of $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  The $23 million increase was primarily due to increases of $20 million and $3 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  The increase at Marina Bay Sands resulted from an $11 million increase in provision during the current quarter and a $9 million decrease in settlements of previously reserved accounts.  The increase at our Macao operations resulted from a $5 million increase in provision during the current quarter, partially offset by a $2 million increase in settlements of previously reserved accounts.  The amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the patrons who owe us money from gaming activities.  We believe the amount of our provision for credit losses in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $15 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase at Marina Bay Sands, driven by increased payroll, maintenance and utility costs.\n37 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nCorporate expense increased $10 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase was primarily due to a $5 million increase in payroll and related expenses and $5 million in legal fee recoveries recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDevelopment expenses were $72 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $55 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the increase was primarily due to increased efforts related to the pursuit of new business opportunities in Texas and in the digital gaming space.  Development costs are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $44 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase was due to increases of $27 million and $17 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  The increase at Marina Bay Sands was a result of the completion of renovations that were placed into service throughout 2024 and through the first half of 2025.  The increase at our Macao operations was driven by a $28 million increase due to new assets placed into service from the fourth quarter of 2024 and onward, mainly related to the Londoner Grand and the Venetian Arena, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in depreciation due to assets fully depreciated during the prior year and through the third quarter of the current year.\nLoss on disposal or impairment of assets was $68 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025.  The losses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2025, consisted primarily of impairments of $51 million on assets associated with the decision to no longer pursue the development of certain digital gaming activities, $9 million related to assets associated with the decision to no longer pursue a casino license from the state of New York and $3 million related to certain assets in Texas, and losses of $4 million in Macao due to asset disposals at The Londoner Macao and The Venetian Macao.\nSegment Adjusted Property EBITDA\nThe following table summarizes information related to our segments:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nPercent\nChange\n(Dollars in millions)\nMacao:\nThe Venetian Macao\n$\n242 \n$\n267 \n(9.4)\n%\nThe Londoner Macao\n219 \n124 \n76.6 \n%\nThe Parisian Macao\n53 \n74 \n(28.4)\n%\nThe Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao\n74 \n102 \n(27.5)\n%\nSands Macao\n8 \n14 \n(42.9)\n%\nFerry Operations and Other \n5 \n4 \n25.0 \n%\n601 \n585 \n2.7 \n%\nMarina Bay Sands\n743 \n406 \n83.0 \n%\nConsolidated adjusted property EBITDA\n(1)\n$\n1,344 \n$\n991 \n35.6 \n%\n__________________________\n(1)    Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments.  Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes.  Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance.  In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of our operations with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation.  Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures.  In order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA calculations.  Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP.  We have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA.  Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner.  As a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n38 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nConsolidated adjusted property EBITDA\n$\n1,344 \n$\n991 \nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nStock-based compensation\n(a)\n(11)\n(10)\nCorporate\n(78)\n(68)\nPre-opening\n(7)\n(4)\nDevelopment\n(72)\n(55)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(368)\n(324)\nAmortization of leasehold interests in land\n(21)\n(15)\nLoss on disposal or impairment of assets\n(68)\n(11)\nOperating income\n719 \n504 \nOther Non-Operating Costs and Expenses\nInterest income\n39 \n67 \nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\n(187)\n(179)\nOther income\n11 \n11 \nIncome tax expense\n(91)\n(50)\nNet income\n$\n491 \n$\n353 \n__________________________\n(a)\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $26 million and $24 million, respectively, of which $15 million and $14 million, respectively, was included in corporate expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. \nAdjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations increased $16 million compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases in casino and hotel operations, partially offset by increased expenses driven by increased competition for gross gaming revenues in Macao. \nAdjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands increased $337 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases in casino revenue, driven by increased win and hold percentages, and hotel revenue, driven by increased ADR and available rooms due to the completion of room renovations.  \nInterest Expense\nThe following table summarizes information related to interest expense:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nInterest cost\n$\n190 \n$\n183 \n    Less — capitalized interest\n(3)\n(4)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n187 \n$\n179 \nWeighted average total debt balance\n$\n15,942 \n$\n13,865 \nWeighted average interest rate\n4.5 \n%\n5.1 \n%\nInterest cost was primarily impacted by an increase in our weighted average total debt balance from $13.87 billion to $15.94 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate from 5.1% to 4.5%. The weighted average total debt balance increased primarily due to the issuance of the LVSC Senior Notes on May 6, 2025, and from the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility, which proceeds were used to repay the $500 million 2.900% LVSC Senior Notes due June 2025 and to fund our share repurchases and the payment due to the Singapore government, pursuant to the Second Supplemental Agreement, related to the Additional Gaming Area.  The weighted average interest rate decreased primarily due to lower interest rates on the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility and 2024 SCL Term Loan Facility, partially offset by higher rates on the LVSC Senior Notes issued in May 2025.\n39 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nOther Factors Affecting Earnings\nInterest income was $39 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $67 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  The decrease was attributable to a decrease in cash available to invest due to share repurchases, dividend payments and development-related spend in the last twelve months.\nOther income was $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.  Other income during the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily attributable to foreign currency remeasurement gains on U.S. dollar denominated debt held by SCL.\nOur income tax expense was $91 million on income before income taxes of $582 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, resulting in a 15.6% effective income tax rate.  This compares to a 12.4% effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  The income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025, reflects a 17% statutory tax rate on our Singapore operations, a 21% corporate income tax on our domestic operations and a zero percent rate on our Macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in Macao.\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. enacted tax legislation referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill (“OBBB”). The OBBB includes significant changes to U.S. income tax laws, including tax cut extensions and modifications to the international tax framework, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others effective in 2026 and later years.  The financial impact of the enactment is included in the Company’s operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2025.  The OBBB is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s 2025 effective tax rate.  Management will continue to analyze and adjust future amounts as related administrative guidance, notices, implementation regulations, potential legislative amendments and interpretations of the OBBB continue to evolve.\nThe net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $72 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $78 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase was primarily driven by increases of $311 million in casino expenses, $141 million in depreciation and amortization, $41 million in development expense and $42 million in loss on disposal or impairment of assets.\nCasino expenses increased $311 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase was attributable to increases of $213 million and $98 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  The increase at Marina Bay Sands was primarily due to a $189 million increase in gaming taxes, consistent with increased gross gaming revenues and an increase in gaming tax rates from 8% to 12% on premium play beginning in July (compared to the increased tax rate beginning in November last year) due to the tiered tax structure in Singapore.  The increase at our Macao operations was primarily due to a $23 million increase in gaming taxes, consistent with increased gross gaming revenues, and increases in casino marketing and payroll and related expenses. \nRoom expenses increased $23 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases of $12 million and $11 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively. These increases were driven by higher costs associated with new and elevated suites and rooms introduced at Marina Bay Sands and the conversion of the Sheraton towers to the Londoner Grand in Macao.\nFood and beverage expenses\n \nincreased $21 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases of $14 million and $7 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  The increases were driven by increased business volumes\n \nand the opening of venues since the second half of 2024\n.\n \nProvision for credit losses was $39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase in provision was due to increases of $19 million and $10 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  The increase at Marina Bay Sands was primarily due to a $10 million increase in the provision for the current period and a $9 million decrease in settlements of previously reserved accounts.  The increase at our Macao operations was primarily due to $7 million increase in provision for the current period and a $3 million decrease in settlements of previously reserved accounts.  The amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the patrons who owe us money from gaming activities.  We believe the amount of our provision for credit losses in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $26 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase was primarily due to an increase of $31 million at Marina Bay Sands, partially offset by a decrease of $5 million at our Macao operations.  The increase at Marina Bay Sands was primarily due to increases in payroll, property taxes, maintenance contracts and software and hosting services.  The decrease at our Macao operations was primarily due to decreases in marketing and repairs and maintenance costs.\n45 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nCorporate expenses increased $5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase was primarily due to a $9 million increase in payroll and related expenses and $5 million in legal fee recoveries recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by $10 million recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024, related to a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government, which was finalized on February 7, 2024, and covers the years from 2023 to 2025.\nPre-opening expenses were $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the increase was primarily due to increases in  marketing and media expenses for the Londoner Grand and property taxes related to the MBS Expansion Project in Singapore.\nDevelopment expenses were $210 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $169 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the increased costs were associated with increased efforts primarily related to our digital gaming pursuits.  Development costs are expensed as incurred. \nDepreciation and amortization increased $141 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase was primarily due to increases of $111 million and $28 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively.  The increase at Marina Bay Sands was primarily due to the completion of the room renovations that were placed into service throughout 2024 and the first half of 2025.  The increase at our Macao operations was driven by a $91 million increase due to new assets placed into service from the fourth quarter of 2024 onward, mainly related to Phase II of The Londoner Macao project and The Venetian Arena, partially offset by a $65 million decrease in depreciation due to assets fully depreciated during the prior year and through the third quarter of the current year, including Sheraton-related assets fully depreciated in connection with Phase II of The Londoner Macao project. \nLoss on disposal or impairment of assets was $83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The losses incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, consisted primarily of impairments of $51 million on assets associated with the decision to no longer pursue the development of certain digital gaming activities, $9 million related to assets associated with the decision to no longer pursue a casino license from the state of New York and $3 million related to certain assets in Texas, and losses of $13 million in Macao primarily due to the demolition costs for room renovations at Londoner Grand and $6 million at Corporate primarily due to asset disposals related to an aircraft remodeling.\nSegment Adjusted Property EBITDA\nThe following table summarizes information related to our segments:\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nPercent\nChange\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nMacao:\nThe Venetian Macao\n$\n703 \n$\n843 \n(16.6)\n%\nThe Londoner Macao\n577 \n399 \n44.6 \n%\nThe Parisian Macao\n163 \n228 \n(28.5)\n%\nThe Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao\n214 \n238 \n(10.1)\n%\nSands Macao\n27 \n36 \n(25.0)\n%\nFerry Operations and Other \n18 \n12 \n50.0 \n%\n1,702 \n1,756 \n(3.1)\n%\nMarina Bay Sands\n2,116 \n1,515 \n39.7 \n%\nConsolidated adjusted property EBITDA\n(1)\n$\n3,818 \n$\n3,271 \n16.7 \n%\n____________________\n(1)    Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments.  Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes.  Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance.  In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of our operations with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation.  Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures.  In order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA \n46 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\ncalculations.  Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP.  We have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA.  Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner.  As a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \n(In millions)\nConsolidated adjusted property EBITDA\n$\n3,818 \n$\n3,271 \nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nStock-based compensation\n(a)\n(17)\n(19)\nCorporate\n(220)\n(215)\nPre-opening\n(20)\n(10)\nDevelopment\n(210)\n(169)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(1,101)\n(960)\nAmortization of leasehold interests in land\n(56)\n(45)\nLoss on disposal or impairment of assets\n(83)\n(41)\nOperating income\n2,111 \n1,812 \nOther Non-Operating Costs and Expenses\nInterest income\n123 \n218 \nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\n(555)\n(547)\nOther income (expense)\n(12)\n16 \nLoss on modification or early retirement of debt\n(5)\n— \nIncome tax expense\n(244)\n(139)\nNet income\n$\n1,418 \n$\n1,360 \n____________________\n(a)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $52 million and $58 million, respectively, of which $35 million and $39 million, respectively, was included in corporate expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.   \nAdjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations decreased $54 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased expenses driven by increased competition for gross gaming revenues in Macao. \nAdjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands increased $601 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The increase\n \nwas primarily due to increased casino and room operations driven by the introduction of new and elevated suites and rooms and other amenities at Marina Bay Sands.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table summarizes information related to interest expense:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nInterest cost\n$\n563 \n$\n557 \nLess — capitalized interest\n(8)\n(10)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n555 \n$\n547 \nWeighted average total debt balance\n$\n15,225 \n$\n14,219 \nWeighted average interest rate\n4.7 \n%\n5.0 \n%\nInterest cost was primarily impacted by an increase in the weighted average total debt balance from $14.22 billion to $15.23 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate from 5.0% to 4.7%.  The weighted average total debt balance increased primarily due to the issuance of the LVSC Senior Notes on May 6, 2025, and from the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility, which proceeds were used to repay the $500 million 2.900% LVSC Senior Notes due June 2025 and to fund our share repurchases and the payment due to the Singapore government, pursuant to the Second Supplemental Agreement, related to the \n47 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nAdditional Gaming Area.  The weighted average interest rate decreased primarily due to lower interest rates on the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility and 2024 SCL Term Loan Facility, partially offset by higher rates on the LVSC Senior Notes issued in May 2025.\nOther Factors Affecting Earnings\nInterest income was $123 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $218 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $95 million, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash available to invest due to share repurchases, dividend payments and development-related spend in the last twelve months.\nOther expense was $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to other income of $16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  Other expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily attributable to foreign currency transaction losses related to the early redemption of the remaining outstanding balance of the 5.125% SCL Senior Notes due August 2025 of $1.63 billion and a debt investment impairment loss. This was partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement gains on U.S. dollar denominated debt held by SCL.\nOur income tax expense was $244 million on income before income taxes of $1.66 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, resulting in a 14.7% effective income tax rate.  This compares to a 9.3% effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflects a 17% statutory tax rate on our Singapore operations, a 21% corporate income tax on our domestic operations, and a zero percent rate on our Macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in Macao.  The income tax expense for the  nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects an income tax benefit of $57 million related to the reversal of the anticipated Macao shareholder dividend tax previously recorded, due to the shareholder dividend tax agreement entered into with the Macao government in February 2024 and covering the years from 2023 through 2025.\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. enacted tax legislation referred to as the OBBB. The OBBB includes significant changes to U.S. income tax laws, including tax cut extensions and modifications to the international tax framework, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others effective in 2026 and later years.  The financial impact of the enactment is included in the Company’s operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.  The OBBB is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s 2025 effective tax rate.  Management will continue to analyze and adjust future amounts as related administrative guidance, notices, implementation regulations, potential legislative amendments and interpretations of the OBBB continue to evolve.\nThe net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $186 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $238 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  These amounts were related to the noncontrolling interest of SCL.\n48 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nAdditional Information Regarding our Retail Mall Operations\nWe own and operate retail malls at our Integrated Resorts at The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao and Marina Bay Sands.  Management believes being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia provides meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow.\nOur malls are designed to complement our other unique amenities and service offerings provided by our Integrated Resorts.  Our strategy is to seek out desirable tenants that appeal to our patrons and provide a wide variety of shopping options.  We generate our mall revenues primarily from leases with tenants through minimum base rents, overage rents and reimbursements for common area maintenance and other expenditures.\nThe following tables summarize the results of our mall operations on the Cotai Strip and at Marina Bay Sands for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nShoppes at\nVenetian\nShoppes at\nFour \nSeasons\nShoppes at\nLondoner\nShoppes at \nParisian\nThe Shoppes at Marina \nBay Sands\n(In millions)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025\nMall revenues:\nMinimum rents\n(1)\n$\n49 \n$\n29 \n$\n14 \n$\n2 \n$\n50 \nOverage rents\n7 \n7 \n4 \n— \n11 \nCAM, levies and direct recoveries\n8 \n2 \n5 \n3 \n8 \nTotal mall revenues\n64 \n38 \n23 \n5 \n69 \nMall operating expenses:\nCommon area maintenance\n4 \n1 \n3 \n2 \n7 \nMarketing and other direct operating expenses\n4 \n2 \n1 \n— \n1 \nMall operating expenses\n8 \n3 \n4 \n2 \n8 \nProperty taxes\n(2)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n1 \nMall-related expenses\n(3)\n$\n8 \n$\n3 \n$\n4 \n$\n2 \n$\n9 \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024\nMall revenues:\nMinimum rents\n(1)\n$\n47 \n$\n32 \n$\n11 \n$\n3 \n$\n44 \nOverage rents\n4 \n6 \n4 \n1 \n11 \nCAM, levies and direct recoveries\n8 \n2 \n5 \n2 \n8 \nTotal mall revenues\n59 \n40 \n20 \n6 \n63 \nMall operating expenses:\nCommon area maintenance\n4 \n1 \n3 \n1 \n5 \nMarketing and other direct operating expenses\n3 \n3 \n1 \n1 \n2 \nMall operating expenses\n7 \n4 \n4 \n2 \n7 \nProperty taxes\n(2)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n1 \nMall-related expenses\n(3)\n$\n7 \n$\n4 \n$\n4 \n$\n2 \n$\n8 \n49 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nShoppes at\nVenetian\nShoppes at\nFour \nSeasons\nShoppes at\nLondoner\nShoppes at \nParisian\nThe Shoppes at Marina \nBay Sands\n(In millions)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025\nMall revenues:\nMinimum rents\n(1)\n$\n145 \n$\n87 \n$\n41 \n$\n7 \n$\n144 \nOverage rents\n15 \n19 \n8 \n2 \n25 \nCAM, levies and direct recoveries\n25 \n8 \n16 \n6 \n24 \nTotal mall revenues\n185 \n114 \n65 \n15 \n193 \nMall operating expenses:\nCommon area maintenance\n11 \n4 \n7 \n4 \n19 \nMarketing and other direct operating expenses\n10 \n6 \n4 \n2 \n2 \nMall operating expenses\n21 \n10 \n11 \n6 \n21 \nProperty taxes\n(2)\n1 \n— \n— \n— \n4 \nMall-related expenses\n(3)\n$\n22 \n$\n10 \n$\n11 \n$\n6 \n$\n25 \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nMall revenues:\nMinimum rents\n(1)\n$\n137 \n$\n94 \n$\n32 \n$\n12 \n$\n130 \nOverage rents\n6 \n14 \n7 \n2 \n27 \nCAM, levies and direct recoveries\n24 \n8 \n14 \n6 \n23 \nTotal mall revenues\n167 \n116 \n53 \n20 \n180 \nMall operating expenses:\nCommon area maintenance\n11 \n4 \n7 \n3 \n16 \nMarketing and other direct operating expenses\n6 \n5 \n3 \n2 \n5 \nMall operating expenses\n17 \n9 \n10 \n5 \n21 \nProperty taxes\n(2)\n1 \n— \n— \n— \n3 \nMall-related expenses\n(3)\n$\n18 \n$\n9 \n$\n10 \n$\n5 \n$\n24 \n____________________\nNote:  This table excludes the results of our retail outlets at Sands Macao.\n(1)\nMinimum rents include base rents and straight-line adjustments of base rents.\n(2)\nCommercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in Cotai.  If the property also qualifies for Tourism Utility Status, the property tax exemption can be extended to twelve years with effect from the opening of the property.  The exemption for The Venetian Macao and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao expired, and the exemption for The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao will be expiring in December 2027 and September 2028, respectively.\n(3)\nMall-related expenses consist of CAM, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for credit losses, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs.\nIt is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income (“NOI”) as a useful supplemental measure of a mall’s operating performance.  Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nIn the tables above, we believe taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls.  Other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses.  As such, this calculation may not be comparable to the NOI of other mall operating companies.\n50 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nDevelopment Projects\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to improve our product offerings, such as refreshing our meeting and convention facilities, suites and rooms, retail malls, restaurant and nightlife mix and our gaming areas, as well as other anticipated revenue-generating additions to our Integrated Resorts.\nMacao\nAs part of the gaming concession entered into by VML and the Macao government (the “Concession”), VML has committed to invest, or cause to be invested, at least 35.84 billion patacas (approximately $4.47 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2025).  Of this total, 33.39 billion patacas (approximately $4.16 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2025) must be invested in non-gaming projects.  These investments must be accomplished by December 2032.\nPursuant to the Concession, we have spent approximately $168 million on these projects for the year ended December 31, 2023. This amount was reviewed and confirmed as qualified spend under the Concession by the Macao government following an audit conducted in July 2024, with results issued in November 2024.  The Macao government conducts an annual audit to confirm qualified concession investments for the prior year.  As of the date of this filing, the audit process for the Company’s investments spent during the year ended December 31, 2024, has commenced.\nPhase II of The Londoner Macao primarily includes the conversion of the Sheraton Grand Macao into the Londoner Grand, an upgrade of the gaming areas and the addition of attractions, dining, retail and entertainment offerings.  The conversion of the Sheraton Grand Macao into the Londoner Grand was completed in the second quarter of 2025 and represents Macao’s first Marriott International Luxury Collection hotel.  Construction of the newly renovated rooms and suites at the Londoner Grand was completed in early April 2025 and resulted in a total of 2,405 rooms and suites.  These projects were substantially completed during the first quarter of 2025.\nSingapore\nIn April 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. (“MBS”) and the STB entered into a development agreement (the “Second Development Agreement”) pursuant to which MBS has agreed to construct a development (the “MBS Expansion Project”) on a land parcel adjacent to Marina Bay Sands.  The MBS Expansion Project will include a hotel tower with luxury rooms and suites, a rooftop attraction, premium gaming areas, convention and meeting facilities and a state-of-the-art live entertainment arena with approximately 15,000 seats.\nOn January 8, 2025, MBS entered into a second supplemental agreement to the Second Development Agreement with the Singapore government (the “Second Supplemental Agreement”) whereby MBS committed to assume liability for the cost of the land premium associated with the additional 2,000 square meters of gaming area and 10,000 square meters of ancillary area in support of the gaming area (collectively, the “Additional Gaming Area”) as well as other adjustments to the land premiums resulting from the consequential changes to the allocations of gross floor area for the MBS Expansion Project since the first payment made in 2019 (the “Additional Land Premium”).  These allocations prescribe and limit the use of the gross floor area for hotel, gaming, retail, food and beverage, MICE and arena at the MBS Expansion Project site.  The Second Supplemental Agreement also formalized the dates by which MBS has agreed with the Singapore government to commence and complete construction of the MBS Expansion Project, being July 8, 2025 and July 8, 2029, respectively.  Construction works for the project commenced as of May 26, 2025, before the requisite commencement date under the Second Supplemental Agreement.\nOur current estimate is that construction will be complete by June 2030 with an anticipated opening date in January 2031, any extension of the completion date beyond the July 8, 2029 deadline is subject to the approval of the Singapore government.\nOur estimated total project cost is approximately $8.0 billion, inclusive of financing fees and interest, land premiums and the purchase of the additional 2,000 square meters of gaming area, increasing Marina Bay Sands’ total approved gaming area to 17,000 square meters across the existing property and the MBS Expansion Project.  \nWe have incurred approximately $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, inclusive of the payment made in 2019 for the lease of the parcels of land underlying the MBS development project site and the payment of SGD 1.13 billion (approximately $848 million at exchange rates in effect at the time of the payment) for the Additional Gaming Area payment, which was made on April 2, 2025.\nThe Tower 3 hotel room renovations at Marina Bay Sands into world class suites was completed in the second quarter of 2025 and the Company is continuing to progress on other property renovations, which include the hotel lobby and SkyPark and additional retail, food and beverage and wellness offerings.  As of September 30, 2025, we have incurred $416 million in costs to complete these projects, which are in addition to the MBS Expansion Project.  The completion of the renovations of Towers 1, 2 and 3 resulted in a total of 1,844 rooms including 775 suites.\n51 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nNew York\nOn June 2, 2023, we acquired the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum (the “Nassau Coliseum”) from Nassau Live Center, LLC and related entities, which included the right to lease the underlying land from the County of Nassau in the State of New York.  We purchased the Nassau Coliseum with the intent to obtain a casino license from the State of New York to develop and operate an Integrated Resort.  On April 23, 2025, we announced our decision to cease pursuit of a casino license from the state of New York in light of concerns regarding a lower anticipated return on investment due to various factors, including the impact of the potential legalization of online gaming on the New York market.  We continue to consider potential acquirors and other development opportunities for the Nassau Coliseum site.  There is no assurance we will be able to accomplish a sale or other development opportunity or to resolve certain matters associated with the right to lease the underlying land from Nassau County.\nOther\nWe continue to evaluate additional development projects in each of our markets and pursue new development opportunities globally.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows — Summary\nOur cash flows consisted of the following:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n$\n1,819 \n$\n2,289 \nCash flows from investing activities:\nCapital expenditures\n(894)\n(1,020)\nProceeds from disposal of property and equipment\n7 \n1 \nAcquisition of intangible assets and other\n(75)\n(10)\nOther\n11 \n— \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(951)\n(1,029)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nProceeds from exercise of stock options\n1 \n1 \nTax withholding on vesting of equity awards\n(2)\n(4)\nRepurchase of common stock\n(1,716)\n(1,300)\nDividends paid and noncontrolling interest payments\n(664)\n(445)\nProceeds from debt \n6,781 \n1,748 \nRepayments of debt\n(4,887)\n(1,979)\nPayments of financing costs\n(201)\n(21)\nSettled contracts for purchase of noncontrolling interest\n(416)\n— \nUnsettled contracts for purchase of noncontrolling interest\n(59)\n(103)\nOther\n(29)\n(78)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(1,192)\n$\n(2,181)\nCash Flows — Operating Activities\nTable games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis.  Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis and to a lesser extent as a trade receivable.  Operating cash flows are generally affected by changes in operating income, accounts receivable, gaming related liabilities and interest payments.  Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, decreased $470 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The decrease in cash generated from operations was primarily related to the $848 million payment for MBS’ purchase of the Additional Gaming Area and a decrease in operating income from our Macao properties, partially offset by an increase in operating income from Marina Bay Sands and an increase in cash related to changes in working capital.\n52 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nCash Flows — Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, totaled $894 million.  Included in this amount was $434 million for construction and development activities in Macao, which consisted of $271 million for The Londoner Macao, primarily due to the Londoner Grand, $131 million for The Venetian Macao and $32 million for the other Macao properties, $425 million for construction activities at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, primarily due to the room renovations being completed across the property, and $35 million for corporate and other costs.  Additionally, in March 2025, we paid approximately $75 million to the Singapore Gambling Regulatory Authority as part of the process to renew our gaming license at Marina Bay Sands, which gaming license now expires in \nApril 2028\n.\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $1.02 billion.  Included in this amount was $534 million for construction and development activities in Macao, which consisted of $348 million for The Londoner Macao, $155 million for The Venetian Macao and $31 million for other Macao properties, and $454 million for construction activities at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, primarily due to the room renovations being completed across the property.  Additionally, we funded $32 million for corporate and other costs.\nCash Flows — Financing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $1.19 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.  We utilized $1.72 billion for common stock repurchases, $664 million for dividend payments, $475 million to purchase SCL shares through open market transactions and forward contracts, and $201 million for deferred offering costs for the refinancing of the 2025 LVSC Senior Notes and the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility, and the draw down on the 2024 SCL Term Loan Facility.  Additionally, there were net proceeds of debt of $1.89 billion, primarily related to proceeds received from the issuance of the 2025 LVSC Senior Notes and the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility.  Lastly, we paid $30 million in other financial liability payments.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $2.18 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  We utilized $1.30 billion for common stock repurchases and $445 million for dividend payments related to our stockholder return of capital program, and funded $103 million for a forward contract to purchase common stock of SCL to increase our equity ownership in SCL and $50 million for a capped call contract to purchase common stock of LVSC.  There were net repayments of debt of $231 million primarily related to the repurchase of $175 million of SCL senior notes for $174 million.  Lastly, we paid $21 million in deferred offering costs, primarily related to the new LVSC revolving credit agreement and the issuance of new LVSC senior notes, and $28 million in other financial liability payments.\nCapital Financing Overview\nWe fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our debt instruments and operating cash flows.\nOn February 21, 2025, MBS entered into a new facility agreement, the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility, which provides for a SGD 3.75 billion (approximately $2.91 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2025) term loan (the “2025 Singapore Term Loan Facility”) and makes available a SGD 750 million (approximately $581 million at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2025) revolving credit facility (the “2025 Singapore Revolving Facility”) and a SGD 7.50 billion (approximately $5.81 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2025) term loan facility (the “2025 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility”).  On February 28, 2025, MBS drew the full amount of the 2025 Singapore Term Loan Facility and SGD 62 million (approximately $46 million at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction) from the 2025 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility and used the proceeds to pay amounts outstanding under the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility.  MBS may draw under the 2025 Singapore Revolving Facility to refinance outstanding indebtedness, pay certain fees, expenses and accrued interest, make dividend payments and for general corporate purposes.  The proceeds from the 2025 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility may be used to finance development and construction costs, expenses, fees and other payments related to the MBS Expansion Project.  In connection with entering into the 2025 Singapore Credit Facility, the commitments under MBS’s amended and restated credit facility agreement, the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility, were terminated.  Refer to “Part I — Item 1 — Financial Statements — Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for further details. \nOn April 1, 2025, MBS drew down an additional\n \nSGD 1.13 billion (approximately $848 million at exchange rates in effect at the time of the payment) from the 2025 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility to fund the payment due to the Singapore government, pursuant to the Second Supplemental Agreement, related to the Additional Gaming Area.\nOn May 6, 2025, in an underwritten public offering, we issued, two series of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion (see “Part I — Item 1 — Financial Statements — Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt”). The net proceeds from the offering were used to redeem in full the outstanding principal under the $500 million 2.900% LVSC Senior Notes due June 25, 2025 and any accrued interest, and to pay transaction-related fees and expenses. The remaining proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases.\n53 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nOn June 5, 2025, we drew down HKD 12.75 billion (approximately $1.64 billion at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction) under the 2024 SCL Term Loan Facility, in which the proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem in full the outstanding principal amount of $1.63 billion\n \nof the 5.125% SCL Senior Notes due August 8, 2025.\nOur U.S., SCL and Singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, as defined per the respective facility agreements.  As of September 30, 2025, our U.S., SCL and Singapore leverage ratios, as defined per the respective credit facility agreements, were 1.39x, 3.37x and 1.51x, respectively, compared to the maximum leverage ratios allowed of 4.00x, 4.00x and 4.50x, respectively.  If we are unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under these credit facilities, we would be in default under the respective credit facilities.\nWe held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $3.35 billion and restricted cash of $125 million as of September 30, 2025, of which approximately $1.86 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-U.S. subsidiaries.  Of the $1.86 billion, approximately $1.57 billion is available to be repatriated, either in the form of dividends or via intercompany loans or advances, to the U.S., subject to levels of earnings, cash flow generated from gaming operations and various other factors, including dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL, compliance with certain local statutes, laws and regulations currently applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements.  We do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise.\nWe believe we have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $3.35 billion and cash flow generated from operations, as well as $4.46 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., SCL and Singapore revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit.\nWe believe we are well positioned to support our operations, maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities, debt obligations and dividend commitments, as well as meet our commitments under the Macao concession.  In the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate global capital markets to consider future opportunities for enhancements of our capital structure.\nOn June 20 and September 12, 2025 SCL paid a dividend of HKD 0.25 per share to SCL shareholders (a total of $518 million, of which we retained $380 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025).\nOn February 19, May 14 and August 13, 2025, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and, during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, recorded $526 million as a distribution against retained earnings.  In October 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25\n \nper common share (a total estimated to be approximately $169 million) to be paid on November 12, 2025, to stockholders of record on November 4, 2025.  Our Board of Directors announced a $0.20 increase in the Company’s recurring common stock dividend for the 2026 calendar year, raising the annual dividend to $1.20 per share ($0.30 per share per quarter).  Our Board of Directors will continue to assess the level of appropriateness of any cash dividends.\nDuring December 2024 and April, June and September 2025, our wholly owned subsidiary, Venetian Venture Development Intermediate II (“VVDI II”), entered into four separate share purchase agreements with financial institutions (the “Agents”) for the purchase of the common stock of SCL (the “SCL Purchase Agreements”).  Pursuant to the terms of the SCL Purchase Agreements, VVDI II made up-front payments totaling HKD 3.65 billion (HKD 800 million in December 2024 and HKD 2.85 billion during 2025) under the SCL Purchase Agreements (collectively, approximately $468 million at exchange rates as of the date of the transactions) to the Agents.\nThe SCL Purchase Agreements allowed for the delivery of shares on a daily basis.  All share purchase transactions have concluded, with the last transaction having concluded on October 10, 2025.  As of September 30, 2025, 174,801,839 shares (of which 25,112,000 shares were delivered during December 2024) in total of SCL common stock were delivered to the Company and an additional 21,938,400 shares were delivered from October 1 through October 10, 2025.\nAdditionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2025, we purchased the common stock of SCL in open market transactions, which resulted in the purchase of 41,944,000 shares of SCL common stock for HKD 852 million (\napproximately \n$109 million\n at exchange rates in effect on \nSeptember 30, 2025).\nThe total additional SCL shares purchased related to these transactions resulted in an increase of our ownership of SCL to approximately 74.49% as of September 30, 2025, and 74.76% as of October 10, 2025.\n54 \nTable \nof\n \nContents\nShare Repurchase Program\n During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 39,487,824 shares of our common stock for $1.77 billion (including $1 million in commissions and $17 million in excise tax) under our share repurchase program.  On April 22, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized increasing the remaining share repurchase amount from $1.10 billion to $2.0 billion.  All share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock.  As of September 30, 2025, the remaining amount authorized under the share repurchase program was $700 million.  Subsequently, on October 21, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized increasing the remaining share repurchase amount to $2.0 billion and extending the share repurchase program’s expiration date to November 3, 2027.\nRepurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise.  The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, cash flows, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.\nAggregate Indebtedness and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2025, there had been no material changes to our aggregated indebtedness and other contractual obligations previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, with the exception of the new 2025 Singapore Credit Facility and LVSC Senior Notes and the associated interest payments, the draw down on the 2025 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility and the 2024 SCL Term Loan and the associated interest payments and, the extinguishment of the 2025 LVSC Senior Notes, the 2025 SCL Senior Notes and the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility.\nPayments Due by Period\n2025\n(1)\n2026 - 2027\n2028 - 2029\nThereafter\nTotal\n(In millions)\nDebt Obligations\nLVSC Senior Notes\n(2)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1,000 \n$\n500 \n$\n1,500 \n2025 Singapore Credit Facility\n(2)\n15 \n116 \n116 \n3,558 \n3,805 \n2024 SCL Term Loan Facility\n(2)\n12 \n98 \n99 \n1,417 \n1,626 \nFixed interest payments\n52 \n173 \n88 \n15 \n328 \nVariable interest payments\n(3)\n44 \n342 \n326 \n190 \n902 \nTotal\n$\n123 \n$\n729 \n$\n1,629 \n$\n5,680 \n$\n8,161 \n_______________________\n(1)\nRepresents the three-month period ending December 31, 2025.\n(2)\nSee “Item 1 — Financial Statements — Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for further details on this financing transaction.\n(3)\nBased on the 1-month rate as of September 30, 2025, Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (“HIBOR) of \n3.54%\n and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (“SORA”) of \n1.20%\n, plus the applicable interest rate spread in accordance with the respective debt agreements. \nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
