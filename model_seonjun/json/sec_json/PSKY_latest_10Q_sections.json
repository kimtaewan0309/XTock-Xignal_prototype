References to “Paramount,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Paramount Skydance Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nThe NAI Transaction\n—On August 7, 2025, pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated July 7, 2024, certain affiliates of investors in Skydance Media, LLC (“Skydance”), comprised of entities controlled by the Ellison Family (as defined below), and affiliates of RedBird Capital Partners (collectively the “NAI Equity Investors”), purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”), which had previously been the controlling stockholder of Paramount Global, from the shareholders of NAI (the “NAI Transaction”). \nThe Transactions\n—Also on August 7, 2025 (the “Closing Date”), following the completion of the NAI Transaction and pursuant to the Transaction Agreement dated as of July 7, 2024, Paramount Global and Skydance became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Paramount Skydance Corporation (the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, the “Transactions”). Paramount Skydance Corporation was formerly known as New Pluto Global, Inc., which was formed on June 3, 2024 for purposes of consummating the Transactions and was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Paramount Global prior to the closing of the Transactions when, through a series of mergers contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, it became the holding company of Paramount Global and Skydance. \nConcurrent with the NAI Transaction, the NAI Equity Investors and certain other affiliates of investors in Skydance made an investment of $6.0 billion into Paramount Skydance Corporation (the “PIPE Transaction”) in exchange for 400 million newly issued shares of Class B common stock of Paramount Skydance Corporation (“Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock”) for a purchase price of $15.00 per share, and the NAI Equity Investors also received warrants to purchase 200 million shares of Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $30.50 per share (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments), which expire five years after issuance. $4.45 billion of the PIPE Transaction investment was used to fund the cash-stock election discussed below and $1.52 billion of cash was provided to the Company.\nThe Transactions also included: (1) a transaction pursuant to which each outstanding Skydance membership unit held by Skydance investors and each Skydance Phantom Unit was converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of 316.7 million shares of Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock (313.8 million shares after reduction in connection with certain tax withholding requirements), and (2) a cash-stock election offered to holders of Paramount Global common stock pursuant to which (a) shares of Paramount Global Class A Common Stock held by stockholders other than NAI or its subsidiaries were converted, at the stockholders’ election, into the right to receive either $23.00 in cash (“Class A Cash Consideration”) or 1.5333 shares of Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock (“Class A Stock Consideration”), and (b) shares of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock held by stockholders other than NAI or its subsidiaries, the NAI Equity Investors and certain other affiliates of investors in Skydance referred to above were converted, at the stockholders’ election, into the right to receive either $15.00 in cash (“Class B Cash Consideration”), subject to proration, or one share of Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock (“Class B Stock Consideration”). The shares of Paramount Class A Common Stock held by NAI and its subsidiaries converted into shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Shares of Paramount Global Class A Common Stock for which elections to receive Class A Cash Consideration or Class A Stock Consideration were not made or were validly revoked were automatically converted into Class A Stock Consideration. Shares of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock for which elections to receive Class B Cash Consideration were not made or were validly revoked were converted automatically into one share of Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock. \n-46-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nShares of Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock now trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “PSKY”. All shares of Paramount Global Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have been delisted from Nasdaq and have been cancelled and ceased to exist. \nHolders of shares of Class A common stock of Paramount Skydance Corporation (“Paramount Skydance Corporation Class A Common Stock”) are entitled to one vote per share with respect to all matters on which the holders of Paramount Skydance Corporation common stock are entitled to vote. Holders of Paramount Skydance Corporation Class B Common Stock do not have voting rights. Following the closing of the Transactions and the NAI Transaction, NAI, which was renamed Harbor Lights Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiaries held 100.0% of the Paramount Skydance Corporation Class A Common Stock. Accordingly, entities controlled by the Ellison Family (as defined below) indirectly hold approximately 77.5% of the Paramount Skydance Corporation Class A Common Stock through their collective approximate 77.5% ownership interest in Harbor Lights Entertainment, Inc., and as a result the Ellison Family is the controlling stockholder of Paramount. For the purpose of determining the controlling ownership of Paramount, the Ellison family is comprised of Lawrence Ellison and David Ellison (the “Ellison Family”). David Ellison is the son of Lawrence Ellison, and Lawrence Ellison and David Ellison are accordingly considered immediate family members. The Ellison Family either individually or through ownership of various entities are collectively the ultimate parent of Paramount (“Ultimate Parent”).\nPushdown of Ultimate Parent’s Basis\n— At the time Paramount Global and Skydance became subsidiaries of Paramount Skydance Corporation, the Ellison Family controlled both Paramount Global and Skydance, and as a result, this transaction has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. As a transaction between entities under common control, the net assets were combined at the Ultimate Parent’s basis, which for Paramount Global was deemed to be the estimated fair value as of August 7, 2025, the date of the closing of the NAI Transaction, which was the point at which the Ellison Family obtained control of Paramount Global. As a result, the net assets of Paramount Global were recorded at their fair value as of this date. Since the net assets of Skydance were already at the Ultimate Parent’s basis, no adjustment to the fair value of net assets was necessary, and Skydance was combined with Paramount Global’s net assets at the Ultimate Parent’s basis as of this date.\nOur consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures are presented in two distinct periods to indicate the pushdown of the Ultimate Parent’s basis, which resulted in a new basis of accounting. The periods prior to the closing of the Transactions include only Paramount Global and are identified as “Predecessor”, and the periods beginning on August 7, 2025 reflect Paramount Skydance Corporation and are identified as “Successor”. Due to the application of pushdown accounting, the results of operations, financial position and cash flows are not comparable between the Successor and Predecessor periods. Paramount Global has been identified as the predecessor entity to Paramount Skydance Corporation based on the relative size and fair value of Paramount Global and Skydance, and the fact that Paramount Global was an existing publicly traded company prior to the completion of the Transactions. No single factor was the sole determinant in the overall conclusion that Paramount Global is the predecessor; rather all factors were considered in arriving at such conclusion. \nWe have certain contracts that may require us to obtain consents from other parties in connection with the Transactions. If these consents cannot be obtained, the counterparties to these contracts (and, as a result, other third parties with which we have contractual agreements) may have the right to terminate, reduce the scope of or otherwise alter their relationships with us following the Transactions. Accordingly, the failure to obtain such consents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n-47-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSignificant components of management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition include:\n•\nOverview\n—Summary of our business and operational highlights.\n•\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n—Analysis of our results on a consolidated basis for the period from August 7 - September 30, 2025 (Successor) and for the periods from July 1 - August 6, 2025, January 1 - August 6, 2025, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Predecessor).\n•\nSegment Results of Operations\n—Analysis of our results on a reportable segment basis for the period from August 7 - September 30, 2025 (Successor) and for the periods from July 1 - August 6, 2025, January 1 - August 6, 2025, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Predecessor).\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n—Discussion of our cash flows, including sources and uses of cash, for the period from August 7 - September 30, 2025 (Successor) and for the period from January 1 - August 6, 2025, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Predecessor), and of our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2025 (Successor), including \nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n.\n•\nLegal Matters\n—Discussion of legal matters to which we are involved. \nOverview\nOperational Highlights - Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\n \nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From July 1 - August 6,\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2025\n2025\n2024\nGAAP:\nRevenues\n$\n4,121 \n$\n2,581 \n$\n6,731 \nOperating income\n$\n244 \n$\n80 \n$\n337 \nNet loss from continuing operations\n   attributable to Parent\n$\n(13)\n$\n(244)\n$\n(4)\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations  \n$\n(.01)\n$\n(.36)\n$\n(.01)\nNon-GAAP:\n (a)\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n655 \n$\n297 \n$\n858 \nAdjusted net earnings (loss) from continuing \n   operations attributable to Parent\n$\n138 \n$\n(162)\n$\n327 \nAdjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations\n$\n.12 \n$\n(.24)\n$\n.49 \n \n(a)  See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n” for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items identified as affecting comparability that are not part of our normal operations.\nAs a result of the pushdown of the Ultimate Parent’s basis, operating income, net loss from continuing operations attributable to Parent, and diluted EPS in the Successor period include amortization associated with the establishment of intangible assets and also reflect the net decrease in programming assets. Net loss from continuing operations and diluted EPS also include interest expense associated with the adjustment of our debt to its fair value. In addition, the Successor period includes the results of Skydance.\n-48-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted OIBDA”) for the Successor period in 2025 excludes the impact of restructuring charges. The Predecessor periods in 2025 and 2024 exclude the impacts from transaction-related items and restructuring charges. See \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n.\nAdjusted net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Parent and adjusted diluted EPS during the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2025 and 2024 exclude the items noted above, as well as discrete tax items and other items described under \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n.\nOperational Highlights - Nine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From January 1 - August 6,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2025\n2025\n2024\nGAAP:\nRevenues\n$\n4,121 \n$\n16,622 \n$\n21,229 \nOperating income (loss)\n$\n244 \n$\n1,029 \n$\n(5,398)\nNet loss from continuing operations \n   attributable to Parent\n$\n(13)\n$\n(35)\n$\n(5,980)\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations\n$\n(.01)\n$\n(.05)\n$\n(9.04)\nNon-GAAP:\n (a)\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n655 \n$\n1,809 \n$\n2,712 \nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations\nattributable to Parent\n$\n138 \n$\n348 \n$\n1,112 \nAdjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations\n$\n.12 \n$\n.51 \n$\n1.65 \n(a)   See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n” for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items identified as affecting comparability that are not part of our normal operations.\nRevenues during the Predecessor period in 2024 benefited from advertising revenues associated with the broadcast of \nSuper Bowl LVIII\n on CBS and Paramount+ in the first quarter of 2024. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl on a rotational basis with other networks, and therefore did not have a comparable broadcast in 2025.\nAs noted above, the Successor period operating income, net loss from continuing operations attributable to Parent, and diluted EPS reflect the pushdown of the Ultimate Parent’s basis, and include the results of Skydance.\nAdjusted OIBDA for the Successor period in 2025 excludes the impact of restructuring charges. The Predecessor periods in 2025 and 2024 exclude the impacts from transaction-related items and restructuring charges and 2024 also excludes impairment and programming charges. See \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n.\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Parent and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations during the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2025 and 2024 exclude the items noted above, as well as discrete tax items and other items described under \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n.\nWe are exposed to political risks inherent in conducting a global business such as retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in the U.S. and other countries, including in connection with the imposition of tariffs and other changes in trade policies. Growing macroeconomic uncertainty relating to the imposition of tariffs \n-49-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nand other changes in trade policies may negatively affect our results, in particular from potential impacts on the advertising market.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Parent, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, and adjusted effective income tax rate, which are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP (together, the “adjusted measures”), exclude certain items identified as affecting comparability that are not part of our normal operations, including impairment charges, restructuring charges, transaction-related items, programming charges, gain on dispositions, loss from investment, and discrete tax items, each where applicable. Programming charges consist only of charges related to major strategic changes, which are further described under \nProgramming Charges\n, and do not include impairment charges that occur as part of our normal operations, which are recorded within “Operating expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and are not excluded in our adjusted measures.\nWe use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; and because they exclude items that are not representative of our normal, recurring operations, they provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results. \nBecause the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, (provision for) benefit from income taxes, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Parent, diluted EPS from continuing operations, and effective income tax rate, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \n-50-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

These adjusted measures exclude the items affecting comparability detailed above. \n(e) For the period from July 1 - August 6, 2025, we recorded a tax benefit of $229 million, primarily reflecting the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to interest deduction limitations as a result of recent U.S. tax legislation. The reported benefit, as well as the adjusted income tax benefit of $123 million, also reflect the tax impact of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, the timing of foreign inclusions between the Successor and Predecessor periods, and the tax benefit on the foreign-derived intangible income deduction.

The dilutive impact was excluded in the calculation of reported diluted EPS from continuing operations because it would have been antidilutive since we reported a net loss from continuing operations.\n-55-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenues\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nSupplemental Pro Forma Revenues \n(a)\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From July 1 - August 6,\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nPro forma Increase/(Decrease)\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nRevenues by Type:\nAdvertising \n$\n1,280 \n$\n664 \n$\n2,174 \n$\n1,944 \n$\n2,174 \n$\n(230)\n(11)\n%\nAffiliate and subscription\n2,027 \n1,400 \n3,215 \n3,427 \n3,215 \n212 \n7 \nTheatrical\n39 \n73 \n108 \n112 \n108 \n4 \n4 \nLicensing and other\n775 \n444 \n1,234 \n1,231 \n1,443 \n(212)\n(15)\nTotal Revenues\n$\n4,121 \n$\n2,581 \n$\n6,731 \n$\n6,714 \n$\n6,940 \n$\n(226)\n(3)\n%\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nSupplemental Pro Forma Revenues \n(a)\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From January 1 - August 6,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nPro forma Increase/(Decrease)\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nRevenues by Type:\nAdvertising \n$\n1,280 \n$\n5,329 \n$\n7,521 \n$\n6,609 \n$\n7,521 \n$\n(912)\n(12)\n%\nAffiliate and subscription\n2,027 \n8,242 \n9,847 \n10,269 \n9,847 \n422 \n4 \nTheatrical\n39 \n475 \n399 \n514 \n399 \n115 \n29 \nLicensing and other\n775 \n2,576 \n3,462 \n3,854 \n3,917 \n(63)\n(2)\nTotal Revenues\n$\n4,121 \n$\n16,622 \n$\n21,229 \n$\n21,246 \n$\n21,684 \n(438)\n(2)\n%\n(a) Supplemental Pro Forma Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 reflect the combination of the Successor period with the Predecessor period from July 1-August 6, 2025 and January 1-August 6, 2025, respectively, and for Licensing and other and Total Revenues also include pro forma adjustments to include Skydance revenues after the elimination of intercompany revenues from Paramount Global during the Predecessor period. While the Successor and Predecessor periods are distinct reporting periods, revenues were not impacted by the pushdown of the Ultimate Parent’s basis and are supplementally presented on a pro forma combined basis to help investors view these revenues in a manner consistent with our management. See \nSupplemental Pro Forma Revenues\n for calculations of these pro forma revenue amounts.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues during the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2025 and 2024 were impacted by declines in the linear advertising market and in the 2025 periods also included the impact on pricing from new entrants to the digital advertising market. The Predecessor periods for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from amounts recognized in each applicable period relating to the underreporting of revenue by an international sales partner in previous periods and political advertising revenue associated with the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. The nine-month period also included revenues associated with the broadcast of \nSuper Bowl LVIII\n on CBS and Paramount+ in the first quarter of 2024. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl on a rotational basis with other networks, and therefore did not have a comparable broadcast in 2025.\n-56-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOn a pro forma basis, the decreases in advertising revenues of 11% and 12% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, include decreases of 4% and 1% from lower political advertising and 4% and 2% from the comparison against amounts recognized in the applicable period in 2024 relating to the underreporting of revenue by an international sales partner in previous periods. The comparison for the nine-month period also reflects a decrease of 8% from the benefit to the first quarter of 2024 from our broadcast of the Super Bowl, reflecting the rotational nature of the rights to this broadcast discussed above.\nAffiliate and subscription\nAffiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of affiliate fees we receive from distributors for their carriage of our cable networks (cable affiliate fees) and television stations (retransmission fees), as well as fees received from third-party television stations for their affiliation with the CBS Television Network (reverse compensation), and subscription fees for our streaming services. \nAffiliate and subscription revenues during each of the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2025 and 2024 reflect the benefit from subscriber growth and pricing increases for Paramount+ but were negatively impacted by linear subscriber declines. Paramount+ had 79.1 million subscribers at September 30, 2025 and 71.9 million subscribers at September 30, 2024. \nOn a pro forma basis, the growth of 7% and 4% in affiliate and subscription revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, reflects increases of 11% and 9% from higher streaming subscription fees, driven by subscriber growth and pricing increases for Paramount+, partially offset by decreases from lower linear affiliate fees. \nTheatrical\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we released \nThe Naked Gun\n and \nSmurfs. \nTheatrical revenues for the Successor period and each of the Predecessor periods in 2025 benefited from these releases. Theatrical revenues during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2025 - August 6, 2025 also benefited from the second quarter 2025 release of \nMission: Impossible-The Final Reckoning \nand the fourth quarter 2024 release of \nSonic the Hedgehog 3\n. Theatrical revenues during the Predecessor periods for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included revenues from the releases of \nA Quiet Place: Day One \nand\n Transformers One. \nThe nine-month period also benefited from the first quarter 2024 releases of \nBob Marley: One Love\n, \nMean Girls\n and Miramax’s \nThe Beekeeper \nand the second quarter 2024 release of\n IF\n.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; revenues from games and other interactive content; and revenues from the rental of production facilities. Content licensing and other revenues include Skydance revenue in the Successor period. On a pro forma basis, the 15% decrease in\n \nlicensing and other revenues for the third quarter of 2025 primarily reflects lower revenues from content produced for third parties, partly due to timing, and licensing in the secondary market.\n-57-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperating Expenses\n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From July 1 - August 6,\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2025\n2024\nOperating expenses by Type:\nContent costs\n$\n1,987 \n$\n1,209 \n$\n3,277 \nDistribution and other\n654 \n493 \n1,065 \nTotal Operating Expenses\n$\n2,641 \n$\n1,702 \n$\n4,342 \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From January 1 - August 6,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2025\n2024\nOperating expenses by Type:\nContent costs\n$\n1,987 \n$\n8,494 \n$\n10,539 \nDistribution and other\n654 \n2,793 \n3,206 \nTotal Operating Expenses\n$\n2,641 \n$\n11,287 \n$\n13,745 \nContent Costs\nContent costs include the amortization of costs of internally-produced television content, theatrical film content, and interactive game development; amortization of acquired program rights; other television production costs, including on-air talent; and participation and residuals expenses, which reflect amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements.  \nContent costs for the Successor period reflect reductions in programming assets resulting from the pushdown of the Ultimate Parent’s basis, as well as the addition of costs associated with Skydance’s content. Programming assets decreased for our \nDirect-to-Consumer\n and \nTV Media\n segments and increased for our \nFilmed Entertainment\n segment as a result of the pushdown. Content costs for the Predecessor period for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include costs associated with the Super Bowl broadcast in 2024. \nDistribution and Other\nDistribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including marketing for theatrical releases; revenue-sharing costs, including for third-party distribution and to television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; compensation; and other costs associated with our operations.  \nDistribution and other operating expenses in each period reflect revenue sharing costs related to revenues for our streaming services, which increased on a pro forma basis in the three- and nine-month periods.\n-58-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nProgramming Charges (Predecessor)\nProgramming charges totaling $1.12 billion recorded during the first quarter of 2024 were the result of major changes in content strategy. These changes, which were made in connection with a shift to a global programming strategy, resulted in the removal of significant levels of content from our platforms, abandonment of development projects, and termination of programming agreements, particularly internationally, including locally-produced content and domestic titles that no longer aligned with a shift to a global programming strategy. The removal of this content from our platforms was a triggering event that required an assessment of whether the affected programming assets were impaired. This impairment review compared the current carrying value of each title with its fair value, which considered (1) that the titles were no longer being utilized on our platforms and there was no intention to use the titles on our platforms in the future and (2) the estimated future cash flows associated with any anticipated licensing of the titles to third parties, which was minimal. The programming charges were comprised of $909 million for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as $209 million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From July 1 - August 6,\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2025\n2024\nSelling, general and \n   administrative expenses\n$\n825 \n$\n582 \n$\n1,531 \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From January 1 - August 6,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2025\n2024\nSelling, general and \n   administrative expenses\n$\n825 \n$\n3,526 \n$\n4,772 \nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs incurred for advertising and marketing for our linear networks and streaming services, research, occupancy, professional service fees, and back office support, including employee compensation and technology.

In addition, we began amortizing FCC licenses over a 30-year period during the third quarter of 2025 (see \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n). \nImpairment Charges\nThe impairment charge of $157 million in the second quarter of 2025 reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of FCC licenses in certain markets to their estimated fair values at June 30, 2025. \nDuring the second quarter of 2024 (Predecessor), a goodwill impairment charge of $5.98 billion was recorded for the Cable Networks reporting unit. In addition, charges of $15 million and $104 million were recorded during the second and third quarters of 2024, respectively, to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in certain markets to their estimated fair values. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from a downward adjustment to the reporting unit’s expected cash flows, primarily as a result of indicators in the linear affiliate marketplace, and the estimated total company market value indicated by the Transactions and the NAI Transaction. \n-60-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRestructuring and Transaction-Related Items\nDuring the periods presented we recorded the following restructuring charges and transaction-related items.\nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From July 1 - August 6,\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2025\n2024\nRestructuring charges \n(a)\n \n$\n185 \n$\n13 \n$\n288 \nTransaction-related items\n— \n175 \n33 \nRestructuring and transaction-related items\n$\n185 \n$\n188 \n$\n321 \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025 and 2024\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\nPeriod From January 1 - August 6,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2025\n2024\nSeverance\n (a)\n$\n185 \n$\n190 \n$\n513 \nExit costs\n— \n65 \n31 \nRestructuring charges \n185 \n255 \n544 \nTransaction-related items\n— \n199 \n51 \nRestructuring and transaction-related items\n$\n185 \n$\n454 \n$\n595 \n(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation. \nRestructuring charges for the period from August 7 - September 30, 2025 (Successor) were comprised of severance costs of $185 million, principally associated with actions to align the business around our strategic priorities following the Transactions, including costs related to a plan under which severance payments are being provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elected to participate. During the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges for severance of approximately $500 million in connection with our realignment process and transformation initiatives. \nRestructuring charges for the Predecessor periods from July 1 - August 6, 2025 and January 1 - August 6, 2025  included severance costs of $13 million and $190 million, respectively, primarily associated with strategic changes in the global workforce in order to streamline the organization. \nRestructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included severance costs of $288 million and $513 million, respectively, associated with strategic changes in our global workforce, and for the nine-month period also related to the exit of Paramount Global’s former CEO and other management changes. \nAdditionally, during the Predecessor periods from January 1 - August 6, 2025 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded exit costs of $65 million and $31 million, respectively, primarily for the impairment of lease assets that we ceased use of in connection with initiatives to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. \nDuring the Predecessor periods from July 1 - August 6, 2025 and January 1 - August 6, 2025, we recorded $175 million and $199 million, respectively principally for banking, legal, advisory, and other professional fees relating \n-61-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nto the Transactions, and transaction awards that became payable to eligible employees upon closing.

The legislation has multiple effective dates with certain provisions effective in 2025. A favorable change to the interest deduction limitation resulted in the reversal of the valuation allowance on our interest limitation carryforward deferred tax asset of $114 million. The net discrete tax benefits for the 2025 Predecessor periods reflect this reversal, partially offset by a reserve for uncertain tax positions.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Predecessor), we recorded a provision for income taxes of $45 million and a benefit from income taxes of $342 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 37.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Included in the provision for/benefit from income taxes are the following items identified as affecting the comparability of our results, which in aggregate increased our effective income tax rate by 12.0 percentage points and decreased our effective income tax rate by 16.2 percentage points for their respective periods.\n-64-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThree and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nImpact from Items Affecting Comparability\nPredecessor\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nEarnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nEarnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nProgramming charges (Note 3)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(1,118)\n$\n275 \nImpairment charges (Note 4)\n$\n(104)\n$\n26 \n$\n(6,100)\n$\n375 \nRestructuring charges (Note \n4\n)\n$\n(288)\n$\n65 \n$\n(544)\n$\n117 \nTransaction-related items (Note 4)\n$\n(33)\n$\n1 \n$\n(51)\n$\n4 \nLoss from investment\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(4)\n$\n1 \nNet discrete tax benefit (provision)\n (a)\nn/a\n$\n2 \nn/a\n$\n(47)\nn/a - not applicable\n(a) The net discrete tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the establishment of a valuation allowance on our interest limitation carryforward deferred tax asset that was not expected to be realized because of a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities caused by the goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2024.

We are in the process of transitioning our reporting structure into three new segments: Studios, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media, which will be completed and reflected in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2026.\n•\nTV Media—\nOur \nTV Media\n segment consists of our (1) broadcast operations\n—\nthe CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast television network; CBS Stations, our owned television stations; and our international free-to-air networks, Network 10, Channel 5, and Chilevisión; (2) domestic premium and basic cable networks, including Paramount+ with Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, The Smithsonian Channel, Nickelodeon, BET Media Group, CBS Sports Network, and international extensions of certain of these brands; and (3) domestic and international television studio operations, including CBS Studios and Paramount Television Studios, as well as CBS Media Ventures, which produces and distributes first-run syndicated programming. \nTV Media \nalso includes a number of digital properties such as CBS News Streaming for 24 hour news and CBS Sports HQ for sports news and analysis.\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer—\nOur \nDirect-to-Consumer\n segment includes our portfolio of domestic and international pay and free streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, and BET+. \n•\nFilmed Entertainment\n—\nOur \nFilmed Entertainment\n segment consists of Paramount Pictures, Skydance’s Animation, Film, Television, Interactive/Games, and Sports divisions, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Studio, Awesomeness, and Miramax\n.  \nThe tables below set forth our financial information by reportable segment. We present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, transaction-related items, programming charges, and gain on dispositions, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance for segment reporting. Programming charges consist only of charges related to major strategic changes, which are further described under \nProgramming Charges\n, and do not include impairment charges that occur as part of our normal operations, which are recorded within content costs in the tables below, where applicable, and are not excluded in Adjusted OIBDA. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management.

Our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes; and pension funding obligations. \nOur investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures; acquisitions; funding of investments, including our streaming joint venture, SkyShowtime, under which we and our joint venture partner committed to support initial operations over a multiyear period; discretionary share repurchases; dividends; and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. Our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years were $3.34 billion as of September 30, 2025. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to manage our outstanding debt maturities, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.  \nFunding for both our short-term and long-term operating, investing and financing needs will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, which were $3.26 billion as of September 30, 2025, and our ability to refinance our debt. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion Credit Facility described below is sufficient to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. In addition, if necessary, we can increase our liquidity position by reducing non-committed spending.\n \nIn connection with the Transactions, $1.52 billion of cash from the PIPE Transaction was provided to the Company, which was used to pay Paramount Global’s transaction-related costs and to pay down borrowings of $720 million outstanding under Skydance’s revolving credit facility.\nOur access to capital markets and the cost of any new borrowings are impacted by factors outside our control, including economic and market conditions, as well as by ratings assigned by independent rating agencies.

The adjustments to fair value for each of our senior and junior debt issuances will be amortized over the remaining term of the applicable issuance within interest expense. \n(b) At September 30, 2025 (Successor), our senior and junior debt balances were net of unamortized fair value adjustments totaling $1.35 billion. At December 31, 2024 (Predecessor), the senior and junior debt balances included a net unamortized discount of $401 million and unamortized deferred financing costs of $74 million. The face value of our total debt at both September 30, 2025 (Successor) and December 31, 2024 (Predecessor) was $14.98 billion. \nSenior Debt\nAt September 30, 2025 (Successor), our senior debt was comprised of senior notes and debentures due between 2026 and 2050 with interest rates ranging from 2.90% to 7.875%. \nJunior Debt\nAt September 30, 2025 (Successor), our junior debt was comprised of $627 million 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due 2057 and $989 million 6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. The subordination and extended term, as well as an interest deferral option of our junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Fitch Ratings Inc., and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n-86-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nParamount Global is a 100% owned subsidiary of Paramount Skydance Corporation. Upon the closing of the Transactions, Paramount Skydance Corporation provided a full and unconditional parent guarantee of Paramount Global’s senior and junior debt. None of Paramount Skydance Corporation’s other subsidiaries are guarantors of Paramount Global’s debt.\nThe tables below present summarized financial information for Paramount Skydance Corporation, the parent guarantor, and Paramount Global, the issuer (jointly the “Obligor Group”) on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances, and do not include nonguarantor and nonissuer subsidiaries. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nSummarized Statement of Operations\nSuccessor\nPeriod From August 7 - September 30,\n2025\nOperating loss\n$\n(9)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n(129)\nIntercompany interest\n$\n(53)\nNet loss\n$\n(108)\nSummarized Balance Sheet\nSuccessor\nAt\nSeptember 30, 2025\nCurrent assets\n$\n1,966 \nNoncurrent assets\n$\n585 \nDebt, current\n$\n346 \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n589 \nLong-term debt\n$\n13,284 \nNoncurrent liabilities\n$\n2,362 \nNotes payable to nonguarantor subsidiaries\n$\n975 \nCommercial Paper \nAt both September 30, 2025 (Successor) and December 31, 2024 (Predecessor), we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nCredit Facility\nOn August 7, 2025, in connection with the closing of the Transactions and pursuant to the August 2024 amendment to the Credit Facility (which is further described below), Paramount Skydance Corporation entered into a joinder agreement pursuant to which it joined Paramount Global’s $3.50 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in January 2027 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes \n-87-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nand to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars is Term SOFR, and for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR, respectively. At September 30, 2025, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the availability under the Credit Facility was $3.50 billion.\nThe Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (“Leverage Ratio”) at the end of each quarter. The maximum Leverage Ratio was 5.00x for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 (Successor) and will decrease 0.25x for each subsequent quarter until the quarter ending March 31, 2026 when it will be 4.5x, and will remain at this level until maturity. The Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. In May 2025, Paramount Global entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility which increased the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio, from $1.50 billion to $3.0 billion, effective immediately, and amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to include an additional add-back (which is capped at 15% of Consolidated EBITDA after giving effect to such add-back) for cash items associated with provisions for restructuring or other business optimization programs, litigation and environmental reserves and losses on the disposition of businesses. We met the covenant as of September 30, 2025 (Successor). \nThe Credit Facility also includes a provision that the occurrence of a change of control will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. In August 2024, Paramount Global entered into amendments to the Credit Facility and the $1.9 billion standby letter of credit facility (see Note 14), which, among other things, revised the change of control provision and related definitions to reflect the ownership structure of Paramount after giving effect to the Transactions and the NAI Transaction. These amendments became operative upon closing of the Transactions.\nUpon the closing of the Transactions, Paramount Skydance Corporation entered into guarantee agreements providing for a full and unconditional parent guarantee of Paramount Global’s obligations with respect to any commercial paper borrowings incurred, and in accordance with the August 2024 amendment to the Credit Facility, a full and unconditional parent guarantee of Paramount Global’s obligations under the Credit Agreement went into effect.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt both September 30, 2025 (Successor) and December 31, 2024 (Predecessor), we had no outstanding bank borrowings under Miramax’s $50 million credit facility that matures in November 2027.\n-88-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nGuarantees\nLetters of Credit and Surety Bonds\nAt September 30, 2025 (Successor), we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $673 million that were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including $436 million issued under a $1.9 billion standby letter of credit facility in accordance with the contractual requirements of one of our commitments. The amount outstanding under the letter of credit decreases throughout 2025 as we make payments under the related contractual commitment. Letters of credit and surety bonds are primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business under contractual requirements of certain of our commitments. The standby letter of credit facility, which matures in May 2026, is subject to provisions similar to the Credit Facility, including the same principal financial covenant (see Note 7). \nOther\nIn the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSee “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of our Predecessor, Paramount Global, for the year ended December 31, 2024 for a discussion of accounting policies that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a material impact on our financial statements. \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Tests \n—\n FCC Licenses—Change in Accounting Estimate\nFCC licenses have historically been classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. However, as a result of sustained declines in industry projections, including in long-term growth rate assumptions, we reassessed this classification and determined that FCC licenses would be classified as finite-lived intangible assets. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2025, we began amortizing FCC licenses on a straight-line basis over a period of 30 years. As of September 30, 2025, the unamortized FCC licenses balance was $2.49 billion, which was included within “Intangible assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nPushdown of Ultimate Parent’s Basis\nAt the time Paramount Global and Skydance became subsidiaries of Paramount Skydance Corporation, the Ellison Family controlled both Paramount Global and Skydance, and as a result, this transaction has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. As a transaction between entities under common control, the net assets were combined at the Ultimate Parent’s basis, which for Paramount Global was deemed to be the estimated fair value as of August 7, 2025, the date of the closing of the NAI Transaction, which was the point at which the Ellison Family obtained control of Paramount Global. As a result, the net assets of Paramount Global were recorded at their estimated fair value as of this date. Since the net assets of Skydance were already at the Ultimate Parent’s basis, no adjustment to the fair value of net assets was necessary, and Skydance was combined with Paramount Global’s net assets at the Ultimate Parent’s basis as of this date. \n-89-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe allocation of the Ultimate Parent’s basis as of August 7, 2025 to Paramount Global’s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests requires the use of significant judgments to determine the inputs used to calculate the estimated fair values, including long-term projections, discount rates, royalty rates, and decay rates. These fair value estimates may differ materially based upon the finalization of appraisals and other valuation analyses, which are expected no later than one year from the Closing Date. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the valuation methodologies used to calculate the preliminary estimated fair values.\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “Litigation”). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \nLitigation Relating to the Transactions\nIn connection with the Transactions, on July 24, 2024, Scott Baker, a purported holder of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court”) against NAI, Shari E. Redstone, Barbara M. Byrne, Linda M. Griego, Judith A. McHale, Charles E. Phillips, Jr., Susan Schuman, Skydance and David Ellison (the “Baker Action”). The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Class B stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Transaction Agreement, among other claims, and seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On November 4, 2024, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation in the Baker Action agreeing to (i) postpone briefing on motions to dismiss until the filing or designation of an operative complaint following resolution of the plaintiff’s motion to appoint him and the Baerlocher Family Trust, a purported holder of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock, as co-lead plaintiffs and Berger Montague PC as interim class counsel (the “Baker Leadership Motion”), and (ii) stay discovery until resolution of any motions to dismiss any operative complaint following resolution of the Baker Leadership Motion. Throughout October 2024, various purported stockholders filed motions for intervention to oppose the Baker Leadership Motion. On December 31, 2024, the plaintiff, along with Mark Baerlocher, as trustee for the Baerlocher Family Trust, filed an amended complaint alleging the same breaches of fiduciary duties against the same defendants as in the original complaint. On June 27, 2025, counsel for Mr. Baker informed the Court that the Baker Leadership Motion would be withdrawn without prejudice and that the group of purported stockholders seeking lead plaintiff status would meet and confer to propose a schedule for resolving lead plaintiff applications.\nOn April 30, 2024, the State of Rhode Island Office of the General Treasurer, on behalf of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, a purported holder of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock filed a verified complaint for the inspection of books and records under Section 220 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) in the Court against us, seeking the inspection of our books and records in order to investigate whether our Board of Directors, NAI, Shari E. Redstone and/or our executive officers may have breached their fiduciary duties to our stockholders for alleged diversion of corporate opportunities (the “220 Action”). The magistrate judge held a trial on July 24, 2024, and denied the request for inspection. The plaintiff noticed an exception to the Court, and on January 29, 2025, the Court ruled that the plaintiff is entitled to obtain books and records that are both necessary and sufficient to fulfill the purpose of its request. On February 25, 2025, \n-90-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe Court granted an implementing order returning the 220 Action to the magistrate judge for further proceedings on the scope of production. On March 24, 2025, the Court granted our application for certification of interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, which was accepted on April 30, 2025. Briefing on the appeal is complete. Certain other purported holders of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock have delivered demand letters to investigate similar alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the Transactions and requested the inspection of books and records. We have also received demand letters from purported holders of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock related to alleged omissions in New Paramount’s registration statement on Form S-4.\nAdditionally, on August 20, 2024, LiveVideo.AI Corp. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Christine Varney and Monica Seligman, alleging that defendants did not fairly consider its offer to purchase Paramount. The complaint asserts claims for unfair competition, tortious interference, unjust enrichment and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, among others, and seeks unspecified monetary damages, costs and other relief. The defendants were never served. The parties exchanged several filings related to service and default. On August 12, 2025, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that the case be dismissed and the court impose $10,000 in monetary sanctions against LiveVideo.AI Corp. The district judge adopted the report in full on September 30, 2025, dismissing the case, imposing the sanctions, and enjoining LiveVideo.AI Corp. from filing any further lawsuits in any federal district court arising out of the Transactions.\nOn August 13, 2025, Gabelli Value 25 Fund Inc. (“Gabelli”) filed a putative class action complaint against Barbara M. Byrne, Linda M. Griego, Judith A. McHale, Charles E. Phillips, Jr., Susan Schuman (the “Special Committee Defendants”), Harbor Lights Entertainment, Inc. (f/k/a National Amusements, Inc.) and Shari Redstone (the “NAI Defendants”), and Skydance Media, LLC and RB Tentpole LP (the “Skydance Defendants”), alleging causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty against all defendants and unjust enrichment against the NAI Defendants. Gabelli seeks a declaratory judgment, damages, including rescissory damages and/or quasi-appraisal damages, disgorgement of NAI’s profits, fees and costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest. On September 16, 2025, the Skydance Defendants filed placeholder motions to dismiss, and Gabelli filed a motion to be appointed as interim lead plaintiff representing former minority holders of Class A shares of pre-Transaction Paramount (the “Gabelli Class A Leadership Motion”). On October 16, 2025, counsel for Gabelli filed a letter with the Court indicating that no competing motions or objections to the Gabelli Class A Leadership Motion were filed and proposed that the Court appoint Gabelli as lead plaintiff.\nOn February 4, 2025, New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the New York City Fire Department Pension Fund, the New York City Police Pension Fund, the New York City Board of Education Retirement System, and the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York, purported holders of Paramount Global Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Court against Barbara M. Byrne, Linda M. Griego, Judith A. McHale and Susan Schuman, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duties for their alleged failure to sufficiently consider an alternate offer that the plaintiffs claimed was superior to the Transactions (the “NYCERS Action”). The plaintiffs argue that the no-shop provision in the Transaction Agreement should be declared invalid and unenforceable because it prevented the parties from engaging in further deal discussions and negotiations with companies other than Skydance, including, specifically, Project Rise Partners, after the no-shop period began. The plaintiffs further assert that the Court has the power to invalidate this provision because Skydance allegedly aided and abetted NAI’s and Shari E. Redstone’s breach of fiduciary duties, including by agreeing to indemnify Shari E. Redstone (through Skydance’s separate agreement with NAI) for any breach of fiduciary duty claims arising out of the Transactions up to a certain amount. Skydance, NAI, Shari E. Redstone and Paramount were not named as defendants in the original complaint. The NYCERS Action originally sought, among other forms of relief, an order from the Court enjoining the closing of the Transactions until the \n-91-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCourt reached a final resolution on the plaintiffs’ claims and an order compelling the Special Committee to evaluate Project Rise Partners’ alternative offer to, among other things, acquire Paramount Global Class A Common Stock for $23.00 per share and Paramount Global Class B Common Stock for $19.00 per share. The Project Rise Partners’ offer was made after the go-shop period in the Transaction Agreement had ended. The complaint does not seek compensatory damages. The plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited proceedings along with their complaint. On February 18, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to join Paramount and Skydance (and various other entities named in the Transaction Agreement) as necessary parties to the litigation and moved for a temporary restraining order preventing the closing of the Transactions until the Court considered the plaintiffs’ anticipated motion for injunctive relief following expedited discovery. The parties reached agreement to withdraw plaintiffs’ request for expedition and their application for injunctive relief in exchange for targeted discovery from certain of the defendants and third parties. The matter is in discovery.\nOn April 8, 2025, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Retirement Fund, Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, Gary Mendelsohn, and Park Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, purported holders of Class B Common Stock, filed a complaint for the inspection of books and records under Section 220 of the DGCL in the Court against us to maintain standing to enforce their statutory inspection rights and seek an order that Paramount produce all the books and records identified in their Section 220 demands to investigate possible breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the Transactions. The complaint alleges that the documents produced to such purported stockholders thus far pursuant to their Section 220 demands are insufficient. The complaint seeks an order requiring us to produce the documents identified in their Section 220 demands, among other relief. On April 21, 2025, the Court approved a stipulation by the parties to stay all proceedings in the action in an effort to resolve the dispute.  \nLitigation Related to Distribution Agreements\nIn October 2024, Sony Pictures Television Inc., along with Jeopardy Productions, Inc. and Califon Productions, Inc. (collectively, “Sony”), filed a civil complaint for damages against CBS Studios Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of California, for Los Angeles County, asserting a breach of contract claim against us relating to our exclusive right to distribute Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! (the “Distribution Agreements”). In December 2024, we filed a cross-complaint against Sony seeking, among other things, a declaration that the Distribution Agreements remain in full force and effect. On February 3, 2025, Sony purported to assume our distribution functions, and on February 4, 2025, we filed an ex parte application, seeking a temporary restraining order preventing Sony from assuming these distribution functions, which the trial court granted on February 5, 2025. On April 10, 2025, the trial court declined to issue a preliminary injunction preventing Sony from assuming these distribution functions for the duration of the litigation. On April 11, 2025, we appealed the trial court’s ruling and requested a stay of the order denying the preliminary injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2025. The parties have reached a settlement of this matter. \nClaims Related to Former Businesses\nAsbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\n-92-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of September 30, 2025 (Successor), we had pending approximately 17,540 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 18,310 as of December 31, 2024 (Predecessor). For the period from August 7 - September 30, 2025 (Successor) and for the period from July 1 - August 6, 2025 (Predecessor) we received approximately 450 and 330 new claims, respectively, and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 910 and 120 claims, respectively.  We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2024 (Predecessor) and 2023 (Predecessor) for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $34 million and $54 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. A significant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict long-term future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate. \nOther\n \nFrom time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors. \nIn connection with recording Paramount Global’s net assets at the Ultimate Parent’s basis, “Other liabilities” was increased to reflect the fair value of Paramount Global’s estimated contingent liabilities for the defense and settlement of asbestos lawsuits as well as claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting liability for environmental cleanup costs and related damages (See Note 2). The estimated fair value of the asbestos-related liability was determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and represents the estimate of the amount a third party would pay to take on the risk of any asbestos-related future losses. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods and, as a result, our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.  \nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n-93-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements \nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments.
