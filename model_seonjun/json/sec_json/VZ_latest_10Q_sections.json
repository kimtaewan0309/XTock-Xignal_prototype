(the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the Company, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world's leading providers of communications, technology, information and streaming products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity and security. \nTo compete effectively in today's dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our high-performing networks to drive growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the digital world. We are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to secure our leadership in both fifth-generation (5G) and fourth-generation (4G) wireless networks. Our network quality is the hallmark of our brand and the foundation for the connectivity, platforms and solutions upon which we build our competitive advantage. In \n2025\n, we are focused on enhancing our networks, offering innovative services and products, growing and maintaining a high-quality customer base and delivering strong financial and operating results. \nOur strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. We believe that our C-Band, millimeter wave and other key spectrum holdings, our 5G network, and our local and long-haul fiber infrastructure, will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth.\nHighlights of Our Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 \n(dollars in millions)\n34\nTable of Contents\nHighlights of Our Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 \n(dollars in millions)\nBusiness Overview\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business). \nRevenue by Segment for the \nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\n and \n2024\n \n35\nTable of Contents\nRevenue by Segment for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 \n———\nNote: Excludes eliminations.\nVerizon Consumer Group\nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\nCustomers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches.\nIn addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis.\nThe Consumer segment's operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 totaled $26.1 billion and $78.4 billion, respectively, representing an increase of 2.9% and 4.0%, respectively, compared to the similar periods in 2024. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics.\nVerizon Business Group\nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including FWA broadband, data, video and advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world. \nThe Business segment's operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 totaled $7.1 billion and $21.7 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the similar periods in 2024. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Business segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in \n36\nTable of Contents\nsegment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker’s (CODM) assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding Corporate and other results.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, these investments included $12.3 billion for capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\" for additional information. Capital expenditures for \n2025\n are expected to be within or below the range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. \nGlobal Networks and Technology\nWe consider the reliability, speed, capacity, coverage and security of our wireless network to be key factors in our continued success. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. Our evolution to 5G with its new architecture allows us to simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements.\nWhile we continue to improve our 5G wireless service coverage, we are also adding capacity and density to our networks. Network densification enables us to increase coverage, improve quality of service and add capacity to accommodate an increasing number of users.\nIn addition to enhancing our wireless service, our wireless mobility investments provide the foundation for our growing FWA broadband business. We are also continuing to expand our fiber-based networks, as customers increasingly value the ability to obtain wireless and wireline broadband services from the same provider. In September 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (Frontier), a U.S. provider of broadband internet and other communication services, as part of our fiber expansion strategy, and we expect to increase the capital expenditures we devote to our fiber networks in 2025.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted. The OBBBA revises the U.S. federal corporate income tax by, among other things, making permanent 100% bonus depreciation on qualified fixed assets, making permanent the immediate deduction for domestic research and experimentation expenses, and permanently changing the limitation on the deduction of business interest expense to 30% of Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). Verizon does not anticipate the provisions of the OBBBA will have a material impact on its effective income tax rate. We currently estimate that these provisions will both decrease our 2025 cash income tax liability and increase our deferred tax liability by $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion by December 31, 2025. We continue to analyze the effects of the OBBBA on our consolidated financial statements.\nTariffs and Other Government Initiatives\nDuring the course of 2025, the U.S. government announced tariffs on goods imported from various countries to the U.S. Countries subject to such tariffs have imposed or may in the future impose reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs and other trade measures. We continue to actively monitor the tariff developments and analyze their potential impacts on our business, cost structure, supply chain and broader economic environment. We are also working closely with our strategic suppliers to manage the potential impacts.\nIn addition, the U.S. presidential administration is implementing significant changes to the size and scope of the federal government, including a reduction of the federal government workforce, changes in budgetary priorities and other cost efficiency measures. Several U.S. states have launched similar initiatives. We have seen negative impacts from these efforts in our business with public sector customers during the first three quarters of 2025. It is also possible that we could see impacts from the federal government shutdown and related federal workforce initiatives that commenced in October 2025.\nWhile these developments have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations to date, due to their evolving nature, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impacts they may have on our business and results in the future but those impacts could be material.\n37\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items, some of which are not included in our segment results. In \"Segment Results of Operations\" we review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail.\nConsolidated Operating Revenues\n \nThree Months Ended\n \n \nNine Months Ended\n \n \n \nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(Decrease)\nConsumer\n$\n26,105\n \n$\n25,360 \n$\n745 \n2.9 \n%\n$\n78,371\n \n$\n75,344 \n$\n3,027 \n4.0 \n%\nBusiness\n7,142\n \n7,351 \n(209)\n(2.8)\n21,703\n \n22,027 \n(324)\n(1.5)\nCorporate and other\n659\n \n685 \n(26)\n(3.8)\n1,982\n \n1,929 \n53 \n2.7 \nEliminations\n(85)\n(66)\n(19)\n28.8 \n(246)\n(193)\n(53)\n27.5 \nConsolidated Operating Revenues\n$\n33,821\n \n$\n33,330 \n$\n491 \n1.5 \n$\n101,810\n \n$\n99,107 \n$\n2,703 \n2.7 \nConsolidated operating revenues increased during both the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2025\n compared to the similar periods in 2024 primarily due to revenue increases in our Consumer segment, partially offset by revenue decreases in our Business segment.\nRevenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading \"Segment Results of Operations.\"\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\n \nThree Months Ended\n \n \nNine Months Ended\n \n \n \nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(Decrease)\nCost of services\n$\n6,863\n \n$\n7,193 \n$\n(330)\n(4.6)\n%\n$\n20,691\n \n$\n21,064 \n$\n(373)\n(1.8)\n%\nCost of wireless equipment\n6,483\n \n6,047 \n436 \n7.2 \n19,596\n \n17,519 \n2,077 \n11.9 \nSelling, general and administrative expense\n7,752\n \n9,706 \n(1,954)\n(20.1)\n23,438\n \n25,873 \n(2,435)\n(9.4)\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n4,618\n \n4,458 \n160 \n3.6 \n13,830\n \n13,386 \n444 \n3.3 \nConsolidated Operating Expenses\n$\n25,716\n \n$\n27,404 \n$\n(1,688)\n(6.2)\n$\n77,555\n \n$\n77,842 \n$\n(287)\n(0.4)\nOperating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading \"Segment Results of Operations.\"\nCost of Services\nCost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer service costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense.\nCost of services\n decreased \nduring both the three and nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025 \ncompared to the similar periods in 2024.\nThe decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to:\n•\na decrease of $189 million related to the asset and business rationalization charge taken in 2024; and\n•\na decrease of $107 million in access costs \nprimarily as a result of\n changes in usage and net circuit access prices.\nThe decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily as a result of:\n•\na decrease of $193 million in access costs \nprimarily as a result of \nchanges in usage and net circuit access prices;\n•\na decrease of $189 million related to the asset and business rationalization charge taken in 2024;\n•\na decrease of $122 million in other direct costs primarily related to legacy wireline products and services; and\n•\nan increase of $154 million in regulatory fees mainly driven by a higher net Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) rate.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCost of Wireless Equipment\nCost of wireless equipment \nincreased\n during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in \n2024.\nThe increase during the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to an increase of \n$426 million\n \ndriven by a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold.\nThe increase \nduring the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to:\n•\nan increase of $1.3 billion\n driven by a higher volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to an increase of 13% in upgrades; and\n•\nan increase of $793 million driven by a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, the provision for credit losses, taxes other than income taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees, rent and utilities for administrative space and device insurance program costs. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in \"Cost of Services.\"\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared \nto the similar periods in \n2024.\nThe decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to:\n•\na decrease of $1.7 billion due to severance charges in 2024 related to separations under our voluntary separation program \nas well as other headcount reduction initiatives\n; and\n•\na decrease of $185 million r\nelated to an asset and business rationalization charge taken in 2024.\nThe decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to:\n•\na decrease of $1.9 billion primarily due to severance charges in 2024 related to separations under our voluntary separation program \nas well as other headcount reduction initiatives\n;\n•\na decrease of $256 million \nrelated to lower costs for device insurance programs primarily due to a decrease in claims;\n•\na decrease of $185 million r\nelated to an asset and business rationalization charge taken in 2024; and\n•\na decrease of $106 million related to a legacy legal matter from 2024 that did not reoccur.\nSee \"Special Items\" for additional information on the severance charges, the asset and business rationalization charges and the legacy legal matter.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased during both the \nthree and nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024 \nprimarily due to the change in the mix of net depreciable and amortizable assets, including the amortization period of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, and the continued deployment of C-Band and FWA network assets.\nOther Consolidated Results\nOther Income, Net \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/(Decrease)\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nInterest income\n$\n68\n \n$\n97 \n$\n(29)\n(29.9)\n%\n$\n186\n \n$\n258 \n$\n(72)\n(27.9)\n%\nOther components of net periodic benefit cost\n(63)\n(56)\n(7)\n12.5 \n(295)\n(289)\n(6)\n2.1 \nNet debt extinguishment gains\n94\n \n90 \n4 \n4.4 \n272\n \n289 \n(17)\n(5.9)\nOther, net\n(7)\n(59)\n52 \n(88.1)\n129\n \n(60)\n189 \nnm\nOther Income, Net\n$\n92\n \n$\n72 \n$\n20 \n27.8 \n$\n292\n \n$\n198 \n$\n94 \n47.5 \nnm - not meaningful\nOther income, net, reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including interest income, debt extinguishment gains, components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost and income and certain foreign exchange gains and losses.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOther income, net remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar \nperiods\n in 2024.\nThe increase \nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to \nan increase resulting from fair market value adjustments on certain investments.\nInterest Expense\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\nDecrease\nSeptember 30,\nDecrease\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nTotal interest costs on debt balances\n$\n1,846\n \n$\n1,904 \n$\n(58)\n(3.0)\n%\n$\n5,505\n \n$\n5,754 \n$\n(249)\n(4.3)\n%\nLess capitalized interest costs\n182\n \n232 \n(50)\n(21.6)\n570\n \n749 \n(179)\n(23.9)\nInterest Expense\n$\n1,664\n \n$\n1,672 \n$\n(8)\n(0.5)\n$\n4,935\n \n$\n5,005 \n$\n(70)\n(1.4)\nAverage debt outstanding\n(1)(3) \n$\n146,578\n \n$\n148,952 \n$\n145,154\n \n$\n151,149 \nEffective interest rate\n(2)(3)\n5.0\n \n%\n5.1 \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n5.1 \n%\n(1)\nThe average debt outstanding is a financial measure and is calculated by applying a simple average of prior months' end balances of total short-term and long-term debt, net of discounts, premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs.\n(2)\nThe effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt. It is calculated by dividing the annualized total interest costs on debt balances by the average debt outstanding.\n(3)\nWe believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our debt financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management.\nTotal interest expense decreased during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024 primarily as a result of a decrease in interest costs due to lower average debt balances partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest due to additional C-Band spectrum licenses being placed into service.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\nIncrease\nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIncrease\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n1,471\n \n$\n891 \n$\n580 \n65.1 \n%\n$\n4,449\n \n$\n3,576 \n$\n873 \n24.4 \n%\nEffective income tax rate\n22.5\n \n%\n20.7 \n%\n22.7\n \n%\n21.8 \n%\nThe effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The increase in the provision for income taxes during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024 was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in the current period.  The increase in the effective income tax rate during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024 was primarily due to a reduction in deferred income taxes due to changes in state apportionment in the prior period.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nUnrecognized tax benefits were $2.6 billion at both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $721 million (after-tax) and $684 million (after-tax) at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nVerizon Communications Inc. and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, we are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years.\nConsolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nConsolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon's competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense to net income.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of \n40\nTable of Contents\ncertain special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See \"Special Items\" for additional information.\nIt is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nConsolidated Net Income\n$\n5,056\n \n$\n3,411 \n$\n15,160\n \n$\n12,835 \nAdd:\nProvision for income taxes\n1,471\n \n891 \n4,449\n \n3,576 \nInterest expense\n1,664\n \n1,672 \n4,935\n \n5,005 \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n(1)\n4,618\n \n4,458 \n13,830\n \n13,386 \nConsolidated EBITDA\n$\n12,809\n \n$\n10,432 \n$\n38,374\n \n$\n34,802 \nAdd (Less):\nOther (income) expense, net\n(2)\n$\n(92)\n$\n(72)\n$\n(292)\n$\n(198)\nEquity in losses of unconsolidated businesses\n6\n \n24 \n3\n \n47 \nAcquisition and integration related charges \n52\n \n— \n52\n \n— \nSeverance charges\n—\n \n1,733 \n—\n \n1,733 \nAsset and business rationalization \n—\n \n374 \n—\n \n374 \nLegacy legal matter\n—\n \n— \n—\n \n106 \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n12,775\n \n$\n12,491 \n$\n38,137\n \n$\n36,864 \n(1)\n Includes Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which were $189 million and $571 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and $186 million and $626 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. See \"Special Items\" for additional information.\n(2) \nIncludes Pension and benefits mark-to-market charges of $136 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See \"Special Items\" for additional information.\nThe changes in Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the table above during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024 were primarily a result of the factors described above in connection with consolidated operating revenues and consolidated operating expenses. \nSegment Results of Operations\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the CODM's assessment of segment performance.\nTo aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income, management uses the following operating statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our segments. We believe these operating statistics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information because they provide additional insight into drivers of our segments' operating results, key trends and performance relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those statistics of other companies.\nWireless retail connections \nare retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections as of the end of the period.

and\n•\nan increase of $47 million driven by a higher volume of wireless devices sold.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024. \nThe decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to: \n•\na decrease of $48 million due to personnel costs related to the impact of workforce changes primarily due to the voluntary separation program that was announced in June of 2024 and completed in March of 2025; and \n•\na decrease of $18 million in advertising costs.\nThe decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to:\n•\na decrease of $231 million in personnel costs related to the impact of workforce changes primarily due to the voluntary separation program that was announced in June of 2024 and completed in March of 2025; and\n•\na decrease of $34 million in advertising costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024 driven by the change in the mix of total Verizon depreciable and amortizable assets and Business's usage of those assets.\nSegment Operating Income and EBITDA \n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease/(Decrease)\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nSegment Operating Income\n$\n637\n \n$\n565 \n$\n72 \n12.7 \n%\n$\n1,939\n \n$\n1,464 \n$\n475 \n32.4 \n%\nAdd Depreciation and amortization expense\n1,035\n \n1,040 \n(5)\n(0.5)\n3,086\n \n3,246 \n(160)\n(4.9)\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n1,672\n \n$\n1,605 \n$\n67 \n4.2 \n$\n5,025\n \n$\n4,710 \n$\n315 \n6.7 \nSegment operating income margin\n8.9\n \n%\n7.7 \n%\n8.9\n \n%\n6.6 \n%\nSegment EBITDA margin\n23.4\n \n%\n21.8 \n%\n23.2\n \n%\n21.4 \n%\nThe changes in the table above during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar periods in 2024 were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with Business operating revenues and operating expenses.\n49\nTable of Contents\nSpecial Items\nSpecial items included in Income Before Provision For Income Taxes were as follows:\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n(1)\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n$\n189\n \n$\n186 \n$\n571\n \n$\n626 \nAcquisition and integration related charges\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n52\n \n— \n52\n \n— \nSeverance, pension and benefits charges\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n—\n \n1,733 \n—\n \n1,733 \nOther (income) expense, net\n—\n \n— \n—\n \n136 \nAsset and business rationalization \nCost of Services\n—\n \n189 \n—\n \n189 \nSelling, general and administrative expense \n—\n \n185 \n—\n \n185 \nLegacy legal matter\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n—\n \n— \n—\n \n106 \nTotal\n$\n241\n \n$\n2,293 \n$\n623\n \n$\n2,975 \n(1) \nAmounts are included in segment results of operations.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure discussed in the section titled \"Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\" as part of Consolidated Results of Operations, excludes all of the amounts included above.\nThe income and expenses related to special items included in our condensed consolidated results of operations were as follows:\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nWithin Total Operating Expenses\n$\n241\n \n$\n2,293 \n$\n623\n \n$\n2,839 \nWithin Other (income) expense, net\n—\n \n— \n—\n \n136 \nTotal\n$\n241\n \n$\n2,293 \n$\n623\n \n$\n2,975 \nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded pre-tax amortization expense of $189 million and $571 million, respectively, related to acquired intangible assets.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded pre-tax amortization expense of $186 million and $626 million, respectively, related to acquired intangible assets.\nAcquisition and Integration Related Charges\nDuring both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded charges of $52 million related to transaction and integration expenses associated with the pending acquisition of Frontier.\nSeverance, Pension and Benefits Charges\nDuring both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded pre-tax severance charges of $1.7 billion related to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net pre-tax remeasurement loss of $136 million in our pension plans triggered by settlements. The remeasurement loss was primarily driven by a $245 million charge resulting from the difference between our estimated and actual return on assets, partially offset by a credit of $109 million due to changes in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans.\nSee Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAsset and Business Rationalization\nDuring both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a pre-tax asset and business rationalization charge of $374 million predominately related to the decision \nto cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses as part of our continued transformation initiatives.\nLegacy Legal Matter\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $106 million associated with a litigation matter related to a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of the Company.\nConsolidated Financial Condition\n \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\nCash Flows Provided By (Used In)\nOperating activities\n$\n28,023\n \n$\n26,480 \n$\n1,543 \nInvesting activities\n(11,680)\n(13,113)\n1,433 \nFinancing activities\n(12,822)\n(11,477)\n(1,345)\nIncrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n3,521\n \n$\n1,890 \n$\n1,631 \nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally, and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity. See \"Market Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility. Our external financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nOur primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar period in 2024 primarily due to an increase in earnings and discretionary pension plan contributions of $365 million made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that did not reoccur. As a result of the prior year discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans and the additional non-cash contribution made in April 2025 in the principal amount of $563 million, we expect that there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2025, subject to changes in market conditions.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to enhance the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintain our existing infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges. \nCapital expenditures, including capitalized software, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $12.3 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively. Capital expenditures increased $244 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar period in 2024 primarily due to Fios footprint expansion and incremental investments to deploy C-Band spectrum.\nAcquisitions of Wireless Licenses\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we recorded capitalized interest related to wireless licenses of $338 million and $485 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made payments of $269 million for obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives associated with Auction 107.\n51\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nWe seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash used in financing activities was $12.8 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $11.5 billion.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by cash dividends paid of $8.6 billion, repayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings of $6.4 billion and repayments and repurchases of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations of $7.5 billion. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from asset-backed long-term borrowings of $7.3 billion and proceeds from long-term borrowings of $4.0 billion.\nAt September 30, 2025, our total debt of $146.8 billion included unsecured debt of $119.7 billion and secured debt of $27.1 billion. At December 31, 2024, our total debt of $144.0 billion included unsecured debt of $117.9 billion and secured debt of $26.1 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, our effective interest rate was 5.1%. See Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt activity, which excludes the impact from mark-to-market adjustments on foreign currency denominated debt.\nVerizon may acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates through open market purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from time to time determine, for cash or other consideration.\nAsset-Backed Debt\nCash collections on the receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation interest collateralizing our asset-backed notes issued to third-party investors and loans received from banks and their conduit facilities are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nProceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. \nSee Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLong-Term Credit Facilities \nAt September 30, 2025\n(dollars in millions)\nMaturities\nFacility Capacity\nUnused Capacity \nPrincipal Amount Outstanding \nVerizon revolving credit facility\n(1)\n2028\n$\n12,000\n \n$\n11,977\n \n$\n—\n \nVarious export credit facilities\n(2)\n2025 - 2031\n10,000\n \n—\n \n4,588\n \nTotal\n$\n22,000\n \n$\n11,977\n \n$\n4,588\n \n(1)\n \nThe revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit. \nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, there have been no drawings against the revolving credit facility since its inception.\n(2) \nDuring the \nnine\n months ended September 30, 2025 and \n2024,\n there were no drawings from these facilities. Borrowings under certain of these facilities are repaid semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot be reborrowed.\n \nOther, Net\nOther, net cash flow from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes $563 million in payments related to vendor financing arrangements, $366 million in equity distribution payments made for controlled entities, $359 million in payments made under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, and $163 million in payments related to tax withholding of employee share based arrangements.\nDividends\nAs in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. We paid $8.6 billion and $8.4 billion in cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  \n52\nTable of Contents\nCovenants\nOur credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other similar covenants.\nWe and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nChange In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nOur Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2025 totaled $7.7 billion, a $3.5 billion increase compared to December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.\nRestricted cash totaled $450 million and $441 million as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation interest that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. \nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\n \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n28,023\n \n$\n26,480 \n$\n1,543 \nLess Capital expenditures (including capitalized software)\n12,263\n \n12,019 \n244 \nFree cash flow\n$\n15,760\n \n$\n14,461 \n$\n1,299 \nThe increase in free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the similar period in 2024 is a reflection of the increase in operating cash flows, partially offset by the increase in capital expenditures, both of which are discussed above.\nOther Future Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2025, Verizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements with third parties for a total of approximately 3.7 gigawatts of anticipated renewable energy capacity across multiple states. See Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\nIt is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.\nCounterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain fixed cap amounts or rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or \n53\nTable of Contents\npost collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds or caps and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At September 30, 2025, we did not hold any collateral. At \nSeptember 30, 2025,\n we \nposted \n$1.1 billion\n \nof collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. At \nDecember 31, 2024, we did not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2024, \nwe posted $2.1 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. \nWhile we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of September 30, 2025, approximately 78% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed-rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $337 million. The interest rates on our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings. \nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $4.7 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $23.0 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively.  \nForeign Currency Risk\nThe functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income. At September 30, 2025, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Swedish Krona.\nCross Currency Swaps\nWe have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the asset of these contracts was $1.4 billion and $500 million, respectively. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $1.2 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $32.2 billion and $32.1 billion, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Forwards\nWe also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We entered into Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries. At both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $750 million and $620 million, respectively.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSpectrum License Transactions\nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. \nIn February 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon was required to make payments for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which were approximately $7.5 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made payments of $269 million for obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon's allocable share of \n54\nTable of Contents\nclearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we were obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred.\nOn October 17, 2024, Verizon entered into a license purchase agreement to acquire select spectrum licenses of United States Cellular Corporation (currently known as Array Digital Infrastructure, Inc.) and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, UScellular) for total consideration of $1.0 billion, subject to certain potential adjustments. The closing of this transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, including the sale of UScellular's wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile US, Inc., which concluded in August 2025, and the termination of certain post-closing arrangements with respect to that sale.\nFrontier Communications Parent, Inc.\nOn September 4, 2024, Verizon entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) to acquire Frontier, a U.S. provider of broadband internet and other communication services. The transaction is structured as a merger of the Company's subsidiary with and into Frontier, as a result of which Frontier will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and shares of Frontier common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of merger (subject to certain limited exceptions) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a per share merger consideration of $38.50, in cash. In November 2024, Frontier shareholders approved the transaction. It has also been approved by the FCC, the Department of Justice and certain state regulators. Consummation of the transaction is subject to receipt of certain remaining regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, Frontier may be required to pay Verizon a termination fee of $320 million. Under certain other specified circumstances, Verizon may be required to pay Frontier a termination fee of $590 million.\nOther\nIn October 2025, Verizon entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire Starry Group Holdings, Inc., a fixed wireless broadband provider serving multi-dwelling units in five markets across the U.S. The closing of this transaction is subject to FCC approval and other customary closing conditions.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nIn this report we have made forward-looking statements.
