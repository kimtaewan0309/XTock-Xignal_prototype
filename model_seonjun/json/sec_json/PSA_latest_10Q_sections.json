Forward-looking statements include statements relating to our 2025 outlook and all underlying assumptions, our expected acquisition, disposition, development, and redevelopment activity, supply and demand for our self-storage facilities, information relating to operating trends in our markets, expectations regarding operating expenses, including property tax changes, expectations regarding the impacts from inflation and changes in macroeconomic conditions, our strategic priorities, expectations with respect to financing activities, rental rates, cap rates, and yields, leasing expectations, our credit ratings, and all other statements other than statements of historical fact. Such statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions made based on information currently available to management and may be identified by the use of the words “outlook,” “guidance,” “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “should,” “estimates,” and similar expressions.\nThese forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may impact future results and performance include, but are not limited to those risks and uncertainties described in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 24, 2025 and in our other filings with the SEC. These include changes in demand for our facilities, changes in macroeconomic conditions, changes in national self-storage facility development activity, impacts from our strategic corporate transformation initiative, impacts of natural disasters, adverse changes in laws and regulations including governing property tax, evictions, rental rates, minimum wage levels, and insurance, adverse economic effects from public health emergencies, international military conflicts, international trade disputes (including threatened or implemented tariffs imposed by the U.S. and threatened or implemented tariffs imposed by foreign countries in retaliation), or similar events impacting public health and/or economic activity, increases in the costs of our primary customer acquisition channels, adverse impacts to us and our customers from high interest rates, inflation, unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, or changes in federal or state tax laws related to the taxation of REITs, security breaches, including ransomware, or a failure of our networks, systems, or technology.\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. All of our forward-looking statements, including those in this report, are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, new estimates, or other factors, events or circumstances after the date of these forward-looking statements, except when expressly required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, neither as predictions of future events nor guarantees of future performance.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n25\nOverview \nOur self-storage operations generate most of our net income, and our earnings growth is impacted by the levels of organic growth within our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) as well as within our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities (both as defined below).\nRevenues generated by our Same Store Facilities remained relatively unchanged for three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased 0.1% ($2.8 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024. Cost of operations for Same Store Facilities remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased by 1.0% ($7.2 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, realized annual rent per occupied square foot for our Same Store Facilities increased by 0.6%, while average occupancy decreased by 0.5%, as compared to the same periods in 2024.\nWe have grown and plan to continue to grow through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expansion of our existing self-storage facilities. Since the beginning of 2023, we acquired a total of 260 facilities with 19.0 million net rentable square feet for $3.8 billion. Within our non-same store portfolio as of September 30, 2025, our Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities include a total of 103 self-storage facilities with 12.4 million net rentable square feet. For development and expansions completed by September 30, 2025, we incurred a total cost of $1.5 billion. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, combined net operating income generated by our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities increased 31.1% ($18.6 million) and 22.8% ($39.1 million), respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024.\nWe have embarked on a solar program under which we plan to install solar panels on over 1,500 of our self-storage facilities. We have completed the installations on 1,108 facilities through September 30, 2025. We spent approximately $49 million on the program in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and expect to spend approximately $75 million over 2025 on this effort.\nOn June 30, 2025, PSOC completed a public offering of $875 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including $475 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at an annual rate of 4.375% maturing on July 1, 2030 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at an annual rate of 5.000% maturing on July 1, 2035. In connection with the offering of senior notes due July 1, 2030, we entered into five-year interest rate swaps in order to manage our variable rate assets. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges, which convert the debt’s fixed interest rate to variable rate. Using the proceeds from this offering we repaid PSOC’s outstanding $400 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes bearing interest at a rate of Compounded SOFR + 0.60% at maturity on July 25, 2025. We plan to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to make investments in self-storage facilities.\nOn October 3, 2025, PSOC completed a public offering of €425 million principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.500% and maturing on January 20, 2034. The senior notes are guaranteed by Public Storage. We received €420.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance. We plan to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding €242 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.175% senior notes due November 2025 and for general corporate purposes, described above.\n26\nResults of Operations \nOperating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $461.4 million or $2.62 per diluted common share, compared to $380.7 million or $2.16 per diluted common share for the same period in 2024, representing an increase of $80.7 million or $0.46 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $71.5 million increase in foreign currency gain primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (ii) a $21.7 million increase in self-storage net operating income, partially offset by (iii) a $10.0 million increase in depreciation expense and (iv) a $5.4 million increase in interest expense.\nThe $21.7 million increase in self-storage net operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 is a result of a $21.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below) reflecting the impact of newly acquired facilities and the lease-up of development/expansion properties.\nOperating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1.1 billion or $6.42 per diluted common share, compared to $1.3 billion or $7.43 per diluted common share for the same period in 2024, representing a decrease of $179.7 million or $1.01 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $193.3 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable, and (ii) a $10.4 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities partially offset by (iii) a $42.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income.\nThe $42.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 is a result of a $47.0 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities, partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease attributable to our Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 0.1% or $2.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 1.0% or $7.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, due primarily to increased property tax expense and centralized management costs, partially offset by decreased on-site property manager payroll expense and marketing. The increase in net operating income of $47.0 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of newly acquired properties and the lease-up of development/expansion properties.\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted common share (“FFO per share”) are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before real estate-related depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, FFO was $4.33 per diluted common share as compared to $3.80 per diluted common share for the same period in 2024, representing an increase of 13.9%, or $0.53 per diluted common share. \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, FFO was $11.48 per diluted common share as compared to $12.34 per diluted common share for the same period in 2024, representing a decrease of 7.0%, or $0.86 per diluted common share.\n27\nWe also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of corporate transformation costs, loss contingencies, due diligence costs incurred in pursuit of strategic transactions, unrealized gain or loss on private equity investments, and amortization of acquired non real estate-related intangibles. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such measures, Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.\n28\nThe following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nPercentage Change\n2025\n2024\nPercentage Change\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nReconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO:\nNet income allocable to common shareholders\n$\n461,408 \n$\n380,712 \n21.2 \n%\n$\n1,128,606 \n$\n1,308,287 \n(13.7)\n%\nEliminate items excluded from FFO:\nReal estate-related depreciation and amortization\n287,472 \n277,652 \n847,702 \n839,749 \nReal estate-related depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investment\n14,706 \n12,013 \n45,664 \n31,531 \nReal estate-related depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders and unvested LTIP unitholders\n(2,009)\n(2,192)\n(6,338)\n(5,904)\nImpairment write-down of real estate investments\n119 \n— \n3,946 \n— \nGains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investment\n(502)\n(554)\n(710)\n(1,428)\nFFO allocable to common shares\n$\n761,194 \n$\n667,631 \n14.0 \n%\n$\n2,018,870 \n$\n2,172,235 \n(7.1)\n%\nEliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investment:\nForeign currency exchange (gain) loss\n(899)\n70,572 \n213,866 \n20,580 \nUnrealized gain on private equity investments\n(6,148)\n(2,626)\n(4,360)\n(4,740)\nCorporate transformation costs\n1,376 \n— \n3,178 \n— \nOther items\n3,167 \n2,666 \n4,082 \n6,031 \nCore FFO allocable to common shares\n$\n758,690 \n$\n738,243 \n2.8 \n%\n$\n2,235,636 \n$\n2,194,106 \n1.9 \n%\nReconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share to FFO per Share and Core FFO per Share:\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n2.62 \n$\n2.16 \n21.3 \n%\n$\n6.42 \n$\n7.43 \n(13.6)\n%\nEliminate amounts per share excluded from FFO:\nReal estate-related depreciation and amortization\n1.71 \n1.64 \n5.04 \n4.92 \nImpairment write-down of real estate investments\n— \n— \n0.02 \n— \nGains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investment\n— \n— \n— \n(0.01)\nFFO per share \n$\n4.33 \n$\n3.80 \n13.9 \n%\n$\n11.48 \n$\n12.34 \n(7.0)\n%\nEliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investment:\nForeign currency exchange (gain) loss\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.40 \n$\n1.20 \n$\n0.11 \nUnrealized gain on private equity investments\n(0.03)\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\n(0.03)\nCorporate transformation costs\n0.01 \n— \n0.02 \n— \nOther items\n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.03 \n0.04 \nCore FFO per share \n$\n4.31 \n$\n4.20 \n2.6 \n%\n$\n12.71 \n$\n12.46 \n2.0 \n%\nDiluted weighted average common shares \n175,884 \n175,866 \n175,916 \n176,074 \n29\nAnalysis of Net Income — Self-Storage Operations\nOur self-storage operations are analyzed in four groups: (i) 2,565 facilities that we have owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2023 (the “Same Store Facilities”), (ii) 260 facilities we acquired since January 1, 2023 (the “Acquired Facilities”), (iii) 103 facilities that have been newly developed or expanded, or that will commence expansion by December 31, 2025 (the “Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities”), and (iv) 224 other facilities, which are otherwise not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since January 1, 2023 (the “Other Non-Same Store Facilities”). The Acquired Facilities, Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities, and Other Non-Same Store Facilities are collectively referred to as the “Non-Same Store Facilities”.

We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and evaluating property operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income, operating cash flow, or other related financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. See Note 14 to our September 30, 2025 consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our total net income for all periods presented.\nSame Store Facilities\nThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities we have owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2023. Our Same Store Facilities increased from 2,507 facilities at December 31, 2024 to 2,565 at September 30, 2025. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us more effectively to evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2023, 2024, and 2025 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe investors and analysts use Same Store Facilities information in a similar manner. However, because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. \nThe following table summarizes the historical operating results (for all periods presented) of these 2,565 facilities (175.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 77% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at September 30, 2025. It includes various measures and detail that we do not include in the analysis of the developed, acquired, and other non-same store facilities, due to the relative magnitude and importance of the Same Store Facilities relative to our other self-storage facilities.\n32\nSelected Operating Data for the Same Store Facilities (2,565 facilities)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange (e)\n2025\n2024\nChange (e)\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per square foot data)\nRevenues (a):\nRental income \n$\n916,590 \n$\n915,614 \n0.1%\n$\n2,731,714 \n$\n2,728,749 \n0.1%\nLate charges and administrative fees\n32,335 \n33,079 \n(2.2)%\n96,947 \n97,118 \n(0.2)%\nTotal revenues\n948,925 \n948,693 \n—%\n2,828,661 \n2,825,867 \n0.1%\nDirect cost of operations (a):\nProperty taxes\n93,983 \n89,566 \n4.9%\n287,503 \n275,015 \n4.5%\nOn-site property manager payroll\n32,169 \n32,928 \n(2.3)%\n95,744 \n101,968 \n(6.1)%\nRepairs and maintenance \n18,108 \n19,269 \n(6.0)%\n58,838 \n58,366 \n0.8%\nUtilities \n13,135 \n13,726 \n(4.3)%\n38,054 \n37,598 \n1.2%\nMarketing\n21,313 \n22,499 \n(5.3)%\n62,313 \n64,971 \n(4.1)%\nOther direct property costs\n24,945 \n26,899 \n(7.3)%\n75,336 \n76,870 \n(2.0)%\nTotal direct cost of operations\n203,653 \n204,887 \n(0.6)%\n617,788 \n614,788 \n0.5%\nDirect net operating income (b)\n745,272 \n743,806 \n0.2%\n2,210,873 \n2,211,079 \n—%\nIndirect cost of operations (a):\nSupervisory payroll\n(10,315)\n(10,273)\n0.4%\n(31,994)\n(31,055)\n3.0%\nCentralized management costs\n(15,476)\n(14,168)\n9.2%\n(46,313)\n(42,697)\n8.5%\nShare-based compensation\n(2,341)\n(2,439)\n(4.0)%\n(7,341)\n(7,718)\n(4.9)%\nNet operating income\n717,140 \n716,926 \n—%\n2,125,225 \n2,129,609 \n(0.2)%\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n(175,567)\n(177,842)\n(1.3)%\n(529,835)\n(533,778)\n(0.7)%\nNet income\n$\n541,573 \n$\n539,084 \n0.5%\n$\n1,595,390 \n$\n1,595,831 \n—%\nGross margin (before indirect costs, depreciation and amortization expense)\n78.5%\n78.4%\n0.1%\n78.2%\n78.2%\n—%\nGross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense)\n75.6%\n75.6%\n—%\n75.1%\n75.4%\n(0.3)%\nWeighted average for the period:\nSquare foot occupancy \n92.2%\n92.7%\n(0.5)%\n92.1%\n92.6%\n(0.5)%\nRealized annual rental income per (c):\nOccupied square foot\n$\n22.67\n$\n22.53\n0.6%\n$\n22.55\n$\n22.41\n0.6%\nAvailable square foot\n$\n20.91\n$\n20.89\n0.1%\n$\n20.77\n$\n20.75\n0.1%\nAt September 30:\nSquare foot occupancy\n90.7%\n91.4%\n(0.7)%\nAnnual contract rent per occupied square foot (d)\n$\n22.88\n$\n22.86\n0.1%\n33\n(a)\nRevenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities. See “Ancillary Operations” below for more information.\n(b)\nDirect net operating income (“Direct NOI”), a subtotal within NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll, centralized management costs, and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. \n(c)\nRealized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income. \n(d)\nAnnual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.\n(e)\nRepresents the absolute nominal change with respect to gross margin and square foot occupancy, and the percentage change with respect to all other items.\nAnalysis of Same Store Revenue\nWe believe a balanced occupancy and rate strategy maximizes our revenues over time. We regularly adjust rental rates and promotional discounts offered (generally, “$1.00 rent for the first month”), as well as our marketing efforts to maximize revenue from new tenants to replace tenants that vacate. \nWe typically increase rental rates to our long-term tenants (generally, those who have been with us for at least six months) every six to twelve months. As a result, the number of long-term tenants we have in our facilities is an important factor in our revenue growth. The level of rate increases to long-term tenants is based upon evaluating the additional revenue from the increase against the negative impact of incremental move-outs, by considering tenants’ in-place rent and prevailing market rents, among other factors. \nRevenues generated by our Same Store Facilities remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased 0.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 remained relatively unchanged due primarily to a 0.6% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot, offset by a 0.5% decrease in average occupancy and a 2.2% decrease in Late Charges and Administrative Fees, as compared to the same period in 2024. The 0.1% increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was due primarily to a 0.6% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot, offset by a 0.5% decrease in average occupancy, as compared to the same period in 2024. \nThe 0.6% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot in both of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024, was due to cumulative rate increases to existing long-term tenants over the past twelve months offset by a decrease in average rates per square foot charged to new tenants moving in over the same period. \nThe weighted average square foot occupancy for our Same Store Facilities was 92.2% and 92.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.5% due primarily to a decline in move-in volume net of move-out volumes, as compared to the same periods in 2024. \nMove-out activities from our tenants decreased slightly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024. Move-out average annual contract rent per square foot decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024.\n34\nSelected Key Move-in and Move-Out Statistical Data\nThe following table sets forth average annual contract rent per square foot and total square footage for tenants moving in and moving out during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Contract rents gained from move-ins and contracts rents lost from move-outs included in the table assume move-in and move-out activities occur at the beginning of each period presented. The table also includes promotional discounts, which vary based upon the move-in contractual rates, move-in volume, and percentage of tenants moving in who receive the discount. \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\n(Amounts in thousands, except for per square foot amounts)\nTenants moving in during the period:\nAverage annual contract rent per square foot\n$\n13.53 \n$\n14.38 \n(5.9)%\n$\n13.19 \n$\n13.92 \n(5.2)%\nSquare footage \n30,543 \n31,716 \n(3.7)%\n93,865 \n94,164 \n(0.3)%\nContract rents gained from move-ins\n$\n103,312 \n$\n114,019 \n(9.4)%\n$\n928,560 \n$\n983,072 \n(5.5)%\nPromotional discounts given\n$\n14,101 \n$\n19,319 \n(3.7)%\n$\n43,444 \n$\n47,496 \n(8.5)%\nTenants moving out during the period:\nAverage annual contract rent per square foot\n$\n20.39 \n$\n20.71 \n(1.5)%\n$\n20.35 \n$\n20.73 \n(1.8)%\nSquare footage \n33,192 \n33,814 \n(1.8)%\n93,539 \n93,726 \n(0.2)%\nContract rents lost from move-outs\n$\n169,196 \n$\n175,072 \n(3.4)%\n$\n1,427,639 \n$\n1,457,205 \n(2.0)%\nWe expect industry-wide demand in 2025 to increase as compared to 2024, across a diverse set of markets, subject to potential adverse effects from evolving political, macroeconomic uncertainty, including changes in trade policy and new tariffs, and microeconomic uncertainty. Following the recent wildfires in Southern California in early 2025, we anticipate an adverse impact on revenue growth at our self-storage facilities located in Los Angeles County, where a temporary governmental pricing limitation is in place under the “State of Emergency” declarations. These self-storage facilities generated approximately 10% of revenues earned by our Same Store Facilities in 2024. As a result, we expect Same Store Facilities revenues in 2025 to be similar to those earned in 2024. \nLate Charges and Administrative Fees\nLate charges and administrative fees decreased 2.2% and 0.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024, as a result of lower late charges collected on delinquent accounts due to lower customer delinquency rates for both periods.\nAnalysis of Same Store Cost of Operations \nCost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased 1.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The year over-year increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was due primarily to increased property tax expense and centralized management costs, partially offset by decreased on-site property manager payroll expense and marketing.\nProperty tax expense increased 4.9% and 4.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024, as a result of higher assessed values. We expect property tax expense to grow approximately 5.5% in 2025 due primarily to higher assessed values.\nOn-site property manager payroll expense decreased 2.3% and 6.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024, primarily due to reduction in labor hours driven by the continued implementation of dynamic staffing models based on customer activity levels. We expect on-site property manager payroll expense to decrease moderately in 2025 as compared to 2024 as we continue to enhance operational processes.\n35\nMarketing expense includes internet advertising we utilize through our online paid search programs and the operating costs of our website and telephone reservation center. Internet advertising expense, comprising keyword search fees assessed on a “per click” basis, varies based upon demand for self-storage space, the quantity of people inquiring about self-storage through online search, occupancy levels, the number and aggressiveness of bidding competitors, and other factors. These factors are volatile; accordingly, Internet advertising can increase or decrease significantly in the short-term. Our marketing expense decreased by 5.3% and 4.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we realized cost efficiencies on our online paid search programs utilized to attract new tenants as compared to the same periods in 2024. We plan to continue to use internet advertising and other advertising channels to support move-in volumes for the remainder of 2025.\nCentralized management costs represent administrative and cash compensation expenses for shared general corporate functions to the extent their efforts are devoted to self-storage operations. Such functions include information technology support, hardware, and software, as well as centralized administration of payroll, benefits, training, repairs and maintenance, customer service, pricing and marketing, operational accounting and finance, legal costs, and costs from field management executives.

See “Ancillary Operations” below for more information.\n(c)\nWe have completed the expansion project on a facility acquired in 2023 for $6.9 million, adding 45,000 net rentable square feet of storage space as of September 30, 2025.\n(d)\nThe amount includes the costs allocated to land, buildings and intangible assets associated with the 127 self-storage facilities from the Simply Acquisition.\nWe have been active in acquiring facilities in recent years. Since the beginning of 2023, we acquired a total of 260 facilities with 19.0 million net rentable square feet for $3.8 billion. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, these facilities contributed net operating income of $46.3 million and $119.7 million, respectively.\nDuring 2023, we acquired BREIT Simply Storage LLC (“Simply”), a self-storage company that owned and operated 127 self-storage facilities (9.4 million square feet) and managed 25 self-storage facilities (1.8 million square feet) for third parties, for a purchase price of $2.2 billion in cash. Included in the acquisition results in the table above are the Simply portfolio self-storage revenues of $116.9 million and $113.9 million, NOI of $81.6 million and $77.9 million (including Direct NOI of $85.8 million and $81.9 million), and average square footage occupancy of 88.3% and 87.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively.\nWe remain active in seeking to acquire additional self-storage facilities. Future acquisition volume may be impacted by cost of capital and overall macro-economic uncertainties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we acquired 74 self-storage facilities across 19 states with 5.2 million net rentable square feet for $814.6 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2025, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 12 self-storage facilities across eight states with 0.9 million net rentable square feet for $119.9 million. As a result, our total acquisitions planned or completed through September 30, 2025, amount to $934.5 million.\n42\nNewly Developed and Expanded Facilities\nThe Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities include 40 facilities that were developed on new sites since January 1, 2020, and 63 facilities expanded to increase their net rentable square footage. Of these expansions, 45 were completed before 2024, 12 were completed in 2024 or 2025, and six are currently in process at September 30, 2025.

at the facilities. See “Ancillary Operations” below for more information.\n(c)\nWe have completed an expansion project on a facility developed in 2023 for $23.8 million, adding 55,000 net rentable square feet of storage space as of September 30, 2025.\n(d)\nThese amounts only include the direct cost incurred to expand and renovate these facilities, and do not include (i) the original cost to develop or acquire the facility or (ii) the lost revenue on space demolished during the construction and fill-up period. \nOur Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities includes a total of 103 self-storage facilities of 12.4 million net rentable square feet. For development and expansions completed by September 30, 2025, we incurred a total cost of $1.5 billion. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities contributed net operating income of $32.0 million and $90.9 million, respectively.\nIt typically takes at least three to four years for a newly developed or expanded self-storage facility to stabilize with respect to revenues. Physical occupancy can be achieved as early as two to three years following completion of the development or expansion through offering lower rental rates during fill-up. As a result, even after achieving high occupancy, there can still be a period of elevated revenue growth as the tenant base matures and higher rental rates are achieved. \nWe believe that our development and redevelopment activities generate favorable risk-adjusted returns over the long run. However, in the short run, our earnings are diluted during the construction and stabilization period due to the cost of capital to fund the development cost, the related construction and development overhead expenses included in general and administrative expense, and the net operating loss from newly developed facilities undergoing fill-up. \nWe typically underwrite new developments to stabilize at approximately an 8% yield on cost (adjusted for impacts from tenant reinsurance and maintenance capital expenditures). Our developed facilities have thus far leased up as expected and are at various stages of their revenue stabilization periods. The actual annualized yields that we may achieve on these facilities upon stabilization will depend on many factors, including local and current market conditions in the vicinity of each property and the level of new and existing supply.\nThe facilities under “expansions completed” represent those facilities where the expansions have been completed at September 30, 2025. We incurred a total of $796.4 million in direct cost to expand these facilities, demolished a total of 0.6 million net rentable square feet of storage space, and built a total of 4.7 million net rentable square feet of new storage space. \nThe facilities under “expansion in process” represent those facilities where construction is in process at September 30, 2025, and together with additional future expansion activities primarily related to our Same Store Facilities at September 30, 2025, we expect to add a total of 1.3 million net rentable square feet of storage space by expanding existing self-storage facilities for an aggregate direct development cost of $165.4 million.\n45\nAt September 30, 2025, we had 29 additional facilities in development, which will have a total of 2.6 million net rentable square feet of storage space and have an aggregate development cost totaling approximately $483.8 million. We expect these facilities to open over the next 18 to 24 months. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we have ongoing development and expansion projects at a total cost to complete of approximately $649.2 million.\nOther Non-Same Store Facilities\nThe “Other Non-Same Store Facilities” represent facilities which, while not newly acquired, developed, or expanded, are not fully stabilized since January 1, 2023, including facilities acquired prior to 2023 and facilities developed or expanded prior to 2020 undergoing fill-up as well as facilities damaged in casualty events such as hurricanes, floods, and fires. \nThe Other Non-Same Store Facilities have an aggregate of 21.0 million net rentable square feet at September 30, 2025. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the average occupancy for these facilities totaled 86.4% and 85.4%, respectively, as compared to 83.5% and 81.4% for the same periods in 2024, and the realized rent per occupied square foot totaled $15.91 and $15.78, respectively, as compared to $16.00 and $16.01 for the same periods in 2024.\nAncillary Operations\nAncillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities, sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities, and management of property owned by unrelated third parties. The following table sets forth our ancillary operations:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\n(Amounts in thousands)\nRevenues:\nTenant reinsurance premiums \n$\n64,007\n$\n58,103\n$\n5,904\n$\n185,382\n$\n168,123\n$\n17,259\nMerchandise \n6,138\n6,894\n(756)\n18,948\n20,767\n(1,819)\nThird party property management\n15,061\n12,646\n2,415\n43,498\n33,403\n10,095\nTotal revenues \n85,206\n77,643\n7,563\n247,828\n222,293\n25,535\nCost of operations:\nTenant reinsurance \n17,766\n17,390\n376\n45,202\n41,964\n3,238\nMerchandise \n4,114\n4,269\n(155)\n12,842\n13,759\n(917)\nThird party property management\n14,505\n12,606\n1,899\n42,322\n33,154\n9,168\nTotal cost of operations \n36,385\n34,265\n2,120\n100,366\n88,877\n11,489\nNet operating income (loss):\nTenant reinsurance \n46,241\n40,713\n5,528\n140,180\n126,159\n14,021\nMerchandise \n2,024\n2,625\n(601)\n6,106\n7,008\n(902)\nThird party property management\n556\n40\n516\n1,176\n249\n927\nTotal net operating income\n$\n48,821\n$\n43,378\n$\n5,443\n$\n147,462\n$\n133,416\n$\n14,046\n \nTenant reinsurance operations: \nTenant reinsurance premium revenue increased $5.9 million or 10.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and increased $17.3 million or 10.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, in each case as compared to the same period in 2024, as a result of an increase in our tenant base with respect to acquired, newly developed, and expanded facilities and the third party properties we manage, as well as higher insurance coverage and premium rates in our tenant base at our same store facilities. Tenant reinsurance premium revenue generated from tenants at our Same Store Facilities were $46.5 million and $136.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to $44.2 million and $130.3 million for the same periods in 2024, representing an increase of 5.2% and 5.0%, respectively.\n46\nCost of operations primarily includes claims paid as well as claims adjustment expenses. Claims expenses vary based upon the number of insured tenants and the volume of events that drive covered customer losses, such as burglary, as well as catastrophic weather events affecting multiple properties such as hurricanes and floods.\nWe expect tenant reinsurance operations to grow as we roll out insurance policies with increased coverage and higher premiums in 2025, and as we continue to increase the tenant base at our newly acquired and developed facilities.\nThird-party property management: \nAt September 30, 2025, in our third-party property management program, we managed 339 facilities (26.6 million net rentable square feet) for unrelated third parties, and were under contract to manage 90 additional facilities (7.7 million net rentable square feet) including 85 facilities that are currently under construction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we added 45 facilities to the program and had 18 facilities exit the program. While we expect this business to increase in scope and size, we do not expect any significant changes in overall profitability of this business in the near term as we seek new properties to manage and are in the earlier stages of fill-up for newly managed properties.\nAnalysis of items not allocated to segments\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entity\nWe account for our equity investment in Shurgard using the equity method and record our pro-rata share of its net income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized earnings from our equity method investment of Shurgard of $3.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, as compared to earnings of $2.9 million and $15.5 million for the same periods in 2024. Included in our equity earnings from Shurgard were $14.7 million and $45.7 million of our share of depreciation and amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to $12.0 million and $31.5 million for the same periods in 2024.\nFor purposes of recording our equity in earnings from Shurgard, the Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.174 U.S. Dollars per Euro at September 30, 2025 (1.039 at December 31, 2024), and average exchange rates of 1.169 and 1.099 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and average exchange rates of 1.118 and 1.087 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nReal estate acquisition and development expense:\n For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we incurred a total of $2.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of expenses related to our acquisition and development of real estate facilities, as compared to $2.5 million and $9.2 million for the same periods in 2024. These amounts are net of $3.5 million and $10.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, in development costs that were capitalized to newly developed and redeveloped self-storage facilities, as compared to $4.3 million and $12.9 million for the same periods in 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized $3.9 million of impairment write-down of certain land development parcels that are or will be marketed for sale.\nGeneral and administrative expense:\n The following table sets forth our general and administrative expense: \n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\n(Amounts in thousands)\nShare-based compensation expense \n$\n5,975 \n$\n7,117 \n$\n(1,142)\n$\n18,997 \n$\n19,927 \n$\n(930)\nCorporate management costs\n9,070 \n7,525 \n1,545 \n25,018 \n22,345 \n2,673 \nCorporate transformation costs\n1,376 \n— \n1,376 \n3,178 \n— \n3,178 \nOther costs \n12,362 \n11,572 \n790 \n32,501 \n31,858 \n643 \nTotal \n$\n28,783 \n$\n26,214 \n$\n2,569 \n$\n79,694 \n$\n74,130 \n$\n5,564 \nGeneral and administrative expense increased $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period of 2024, primarily due to transaction costs and an increase in corporate transformation costs recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2025.\n47\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period of 2024, primarily due to transaction costs and increased legal costs associated with nonrecurring corporate legal matters and corporate transformation costs recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nAs part of our operating model transformation, we have launched a corporate transformation initiative focused on modernization and growth. This includes streamlining our processes through technology and expanding our geographic footprint with a stronger corporate presence in Texas and offshore locations. The initiative is intended to transform our corporate functions improving efficiency and productivity. \nWe expect to incur corporate transformation costs of approximately $15 to $20 million as we complete the initiative over the next three years. Beginning in 2026, we believe this restructuring plan will result in future cost savings of approximately $3 to $5 million annually, although the amount and timing of such savings are subject to change depending on a variety of factors.\nInterest and other income:\n The following table sets forth our interest and other income: \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\n(Amounts in thousands)\nInterest earned on cash balances\n$\n8,598 \n$\n12,235 \n$\n(3,637)\n$\n23,668 \n$\n33,838 \n$\n(10,170)\nCommercial operations\n1,849 \n2,223 \n(374)\n7,203 \n7,065 \n138 \nInterest earned on notes receivable, net\n1,733 \n— \n1,733 \n2,976 \n— \n2,976 \nUnrealized gain on private equity investments\n6,148 \n2,626 \n3,522 \n4,360 \n4,740 \n(380)\nOther\n2,684 \n2,945 \n(261)\n8,828 \n6,605 \n2,223 \nTotal \n$\n21,012 \n$\n20,029 \n$\n983 \n$\n47,035 \n$\n52,248 \n$\n(5,213)\nInterest expense:\n For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we incurred $81.6 million and $228.3 million, respectively, of interest on our outstanding notes payable, as compared to $77.3 million and $223.5 million for the same periods in 2024. In determining interest expense, these amounts were offset by capitalized interest of $1.9 million and $5.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, associated with our development activities, as compared to $3.0 million and $8.2 million for the same periods in 2024. The increase of interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024 is due to the issuance of U.S. Dollar and Euro denominated unsecured notes in April 2024 and the issuance of U.S. Dollar unsecured notes in June 2025 partially offset by a more favorable weighted average interest rate. At September 30, 2025, we had $10.1 billion of notes payable outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.0%.\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss):\n For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded foreign currency gains of $0.9 million and losses of $213.9 million, respectively, representing primarily the changes in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Euro-denominated unsecured notes due to fluctuations in exchange rates, as compared to foreign currency losses of $70.6 million and $20.6 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.174 U.S. Dollars per Euro at September 30, 2025, 1.039 at December 31, 2024, 1.116 at September 30, 2024, and 1.104 at December 31, 2023. Future gains and losses on foreign currency will be dependent upon changes in the relative value of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar and the level of Euro-denominated notes payable outstanding.\nIncome tax expense:\n We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded income tax expense totaling $2.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, related to income taxes incurred in certain state and local jurisdictions in which we operate, as compared to $2.5 million and $6.0 million for the same periods in 2024. \n48\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview and our Sources of Capital\nWhile operating as a REIT allows us to minimize the payment of U.S. federal corporate income tax expense, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. Notwithstanding this requirement, our annual operating retained cash flow was approximately $480 million in 2023 and $400 million in 2024. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities (including property operating costs and interest payments described below), less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures. We expect retained cash flow of approximately $650 million for 2025.\nCapital needs in excess of retained cash flow are met with: (i) medium and long-term debt, (ii) preferred equity, (iii) limited partnership interests, and (iv) common equity. We select among these sources of capital based upon relative cost, availability, the desire for leverage, and considering potential constraints caused by certain features of capital sources, such as debt covenants. We view our line of credit, as well as any short-term bank loans, as bridge financing. \nBecause raising capital is important to our growth, we endeavor to maintain a strong financial profile characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. We are one of the highest rated REITs, as rated by major rating agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Our senior notes payable have an “A” credit rating by Standard & Poor’s and “A2” by Moody’s. Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are “A3” by Moody’s and “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s. Our credit profile enables us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital.\nOur revolving line of credit has a borrowing limit of $1.5 billion. The revolving line of credit generally serves as a temporary “bridge” financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. As of September 30, 2025 and October 29, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit; however, we do have approximately $19.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, which limits our borrowing capacity to $1,480.1 million as of October 29, 2025. Our line of credit matures on June 12, 2027.\nIn December 2024, we implemented an “at the market” offering program pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell common shares through participating agents up to an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Since the inception of the program, we have issued a total of 184,390 common shares on the open market for an aggregate gross sales price of $61.4 million and received net proceeds of approximately $60.3 million after issuance costs (none in 2025).\nWe believe that we have significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and opportunities, and we have significant access to sources of capital including debt and preferred equity. Based on our strong credit profile and our substantial current liquidity relative to our capital requirements noted below, we would not expect any potential capital market dislocations to have a material impact upon our expected capital and growth plans over the next 12 months. However, if capital market conditions deteriorate significantly for a long period of time, our access to or cost of debt and preferred equity capital could be negatively impacted and potentially affect future investment activities.\nOur current and expected capital resources include: (i) $296.5 million of cash as of September 30, 2025, (ii) approximately $650 million of expected retained operating cash flow over the next twelve months and (iii) €420.9 million of cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in October 2025. Additionally, we have $1,480.1 million available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, which can be used as temporary “bridge” financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. We believe that the cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing cash requirements for interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.\n49\nAs described below, as of September 30, 2025 our current committed cash requirements consist of (i) $119.9 million in property acquisitions currently under contract, (ii) $381.4 million of remaining spending on our current development pipeline, which will be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months, (iii) unfunded loan commitments of $43.9 million under the bridge lending program expected to close in the next twelve months, and (iv) approximately $784.0 million in scheduled principal repayments on our unsecured notes in the next twelve months. Our cash requirements may increase over the next year as we add projects to our development pipeline and acquire additional properties. Additional potential cash requirements could result from various activities including the redemption of outstanding preferred securities, repurchases of common stock, or merger and acquisition activities, as and to the extent we determine to engage in such activities.\nOver the long term, to the extent that our cash requirements exceed our capital resources, we believe we have a variety of possibilities to raise additional capital including issuing common or preferred securities, debt, and limited partnership interests, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.\nCash Requirements\nThe following summarizes our expected material cash requirements, which comprise (i) contractually obligated expenditures, including payments of principal and interest, (ii) other essential expenditures, including property operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and dividends paid in accordance with REIT distribution requirements, and (iii) opportunistic expenditures, including acquisitions and developments and repurchases of our securities. We expect to satisfy these cash requirements through operating cash flow and opportunistic debt and equity financings.\nRequired Debt Repayments:\n \nAs of September 30, 2025, the principal outstanding on our debt totaled approximately $10.1 billion, consisting of $8.2 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured notes payable, $1.9 billion of Euro-denominated unsecured notes payable, and $1.6 million of mortgage notes payable. Approximate principal maturities and interest payments (including $61.8 million in estimated interest on our $0.7 billion variable rate unsecured notes based on rates in effect at September 30, 2025) are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nPrincipal\nInterest\nTotal\nRemainder of 2025\n$\n284,082\n$\n53,894\n$\n337,976\n2026\n1,150,138\n296,441\n1,446,579\n2027\n1,200,146\n266,852\n1,466,998\n2028\n1,200,129\n227,717\n1,427,846\n2029\n1,000,088\n189,704\n1,189,792\nThereafter \n5,260,552\n1,553,737\n6,814,289\n$\n10,095,135\n$\n2,588,345\n$\n12,683,480\nWe had $400 million of U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured notes that we repaid upon maturity on July 25, 2025. We have €242 million of our Euro denominated unsecured notes that mature on November 3, 2025, and $500 million of our U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured notes that mature on February 15, 2026. We plan to utilize the proceeds from our October 2025 Euro denominated unsecured notes issuance to refinance the November 2025 Euro denominated unsecured notes and plan to refinance the U.S Dollar denominated notes as they come due.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements:\n Capital expenditures include general maintenance, major repairs, or replacements to elements of our facilities to keep our facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal. Capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or redevelopment of existing facilities to increase their available rentable square footage. \nWe have spent $139 million of capital expenditures to maintain real estate facilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and expect to spend approximately $175 million in 2025. In addition, we have spent $49 million on the installation of solar panels in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and expect to spend approximately $75 million in 2025.\nWe believe the capital spent to install solar panels and LED lights will significantly reduce electricity consumption resulting in lower utility costs. \n50\nRequirement to Pay Distributions:\n For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our “REIT taxable income” (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT.\n \nOur consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute our taxable income. Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash flows from operating activities.\nOn October 29, 2025, our Board declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $3.00 per common share totaling approximately $527 million, which will be paid at the end of December 2025. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute our taxable income. Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash flows from operating activities.\nThe annual distribution requirement with respect to our preferred shares outstanding at September 30, 2025 is approximately $194.7 million per year. \nReal Estate Investment Activities:\n \nWe continue to seek to acquire additional self-storage facilities from third parties. Subsequent to September 30, 2025, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 12 self-storage facilities for a total purchase price of $119.9 million. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had development and expansion projects at a total cost of approximately $649.2 million. Costs incurred through September 30, 2025 were $267.8 million, with the remaining cost to complete of $381.4 million expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months. Some of these projects are subject to contingencies such as entitlement approval. We expect to continue to seek to add projects to maintain and increase our robust pipeline. Our ability to do so continues to be challenged by various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage facilities in certain municipalities.\nBridge loan commitments: \nWe offer bridge loan financing to third-party self-storage owners for operating properties that we manage. As of September 30, 2025, we had unfunded loan commitments of $43.9 million expected to close in the next twelve months, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nProperty Operating Expenses:\n The direct and indirect cost of our operations impose significant cash requirements. Direct operating costs include property taxes, on-site property manager payroll, repairs and maintenance, utilities, and marketing. Indirect operating costs include supervisory payroll and centralized management costs. The cash requirements from these operating costs will vary year to year based on, among other things, changes in the size of our portfolio and changes in property tax rates and assessed values, wage rates, and marketing costs in our markets.\nRedemption of Preferred Securities\n: Historically, we have taken advantage of refinancing higher coupon preferred securities with lower coupon preferred securities. In the future, we may also elect to finance the redemption of preferred securities with proceeds from the issuance of debt. As of October 29, 2025, our Series F through N of preferred securities are eligible for redemption, at our option and with 30 days’ notice. See Note 10 to our September 30, 2025 consolidated financial statements for the redemption dates of all of our series of preferred shares. Redemption of such preferred shares will depend upon many factors, including the rate at which we could issue replacement preferred securities. None of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.\nRepurchases of Common Shares\n: Our Board has authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which management may purchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. From the inception of the repurchase program through October 29, 2025, we have repurchased a total of 24,448,781 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $879.1 million (none in 2025 through October 29, 2025). All the repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an authorized and unissued status. Future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.\n51\nNew Tax Legislation\nEffective July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. Certain provisions of OBBBA impact us and our shareholders. Among other changes, this legislation (i) permanently extended the 20% deduction for “qualified REIT dividends” for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers under Section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”), (ii) permanently reinstates 100% bonus depreciation for certain property acquired after January 19, 2025, (iii) increased the percentage limit under the REIT asset test applicable to taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) from 20% to 25% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and (iv) increases the base on which the 30% interest deduction limit under Section 163(j) of the Code applies by excluding depreciation, amortization and depletion from the definition of “adjusted taxable income” (i.e. based on EBITDA rather than EBIT) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.\n52"
