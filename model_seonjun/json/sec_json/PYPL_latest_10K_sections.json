  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOVERVIEW\nAt PayPal Holdings, Inc., our mission is to revolutionize commerce globally. Our products are designed to enable digital payments and simplify commerce experiences for consumers and merchants to make selling, shopping, and sending and receiving money simple, personalized, and secure, online or offline, including mobile. Our two-sided platform serves millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.\nWe help consumers transact quickly and securely with merchants, manage their financial lives, and send to and receive money from friends and family around the globe. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants securely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. \nWe help merchants connect with customers, increase conversion rates and sales, and grow their businesses in the markets where our services are available. We provide large enterprises and small and medium businesses with online branded checkout solutions, including PayPal and Venmo; online unbranded payments processing, including Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments; our buy now, pay later solutions, which we refer to as PayPal Pay Later; in-person point of sale systems, including Zettle; business financing, including PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”); payouts capabilities; and risk tools. \nWe operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects consumers and merchants with 434 million active accounts across approximately 200 markets as of December 31, 2024. \nWe earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services, which are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our payments platform. We also generate revenue from customers for currency conversion, for instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; however, we generally do not charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts. We also earn revenue by providing other value added services, which primarily comprise revenue earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our consumer and merchant credit products, interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances, referral fees, subscription fees, and gateway services. \nUnless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n4\nTable of Contents\nKEY PERFORMANCE METRICS\nIn 2024, we processed $1.68 trillion of total payment volume (“TPV”), an increase of 10% compared to 2023, and 26.3 billion payment transactions, an increase of 5% compared to 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts, an increase of 2% compared to December 31, 2023. \nWe measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers through certain metrics, including TPV, payment transactions, and active accounts:\nTPV\n \nis the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nNumber of payment transactions\n is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nAn \nactive account\n \nis an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\nOUR STRENGTHS\nOur business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive profitable growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:\n•\nTwo-sided platform\n—\nwe facilitate online and offline transactions for millions of consumers and merchants. Our relationship on both sides of a transaction enables us to offer unique product experiences designed to remove friction, drive sales, and enhance shopping experiences. We utilize the data about how our customers use our platform to continually innovate and improve it.\n•\nTrusted brands\n—\nwe have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, Venmo, and Braintree. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers. \n•\nOpen ecosystem\n—\nwe are technology and platform agnostic. This approach allows our merchants to offer and use a variety of our branded and unbranded payment processing solutions and business financing products, alongside other tools. We give consumers flexibility to make and receive payments using a wide variety of funding options and digital wallet solutions, including their bank account, PayPal and Venmo account balance, buy now, pay later, debit and credit options.\n•\nScale\n—\nour global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts in approximately 200 markets\n1\n around the world. \n•\nRisk and compliance management\n—\nour enterprise risk and compliance management program is designed to help keep customer information secure and ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.\n•\nRegulatory licenses\n—\nwe believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth.\n1\nA market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. \n5\nTable of Contents\nCONSUMER AND MERCHANT PAYMENT SOLUTIONS\nConsumer value proposition\nWe help consumers transact securely with merchants, manage their financial lives, and send to and receive money from friends and family around the globe. Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and Venmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and Venmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. Our Venmo digital wallet in the United States (“U.S.”) is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. \nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”), France, and Germany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interest-bearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in Germany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and Venmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network. \nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nMerchant value proposition\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\nOur PayPal and Venmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales. \nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe offer access to merchant financing products for eligible small and medium-sized businesses through the PPWC and PPBL products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant financing solutions. The PPWC product allows businesses to access a loan or cash advance for a fixed fee, based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PPBL product provides businesses with access to short-term financing for a fixed fee or interest based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. In the U.S., these products are provided under a program agreement with an independent chartered financial institution. We believe that our merchant financing solutions enable us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available from traditional banks or other lenders. \nWe generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans and advances and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nPROTECTING CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS\nProtecting consumers and merchants on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is important to successfully compete and sustainably grow our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and malicious activities by counterparties, represent a significant risk to consumers and merchants, as well as their payment partners. In addition to the protections afforded by applicable law, we provide consumers and merchants with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. Our protection programs help protect both consumers and merchants from financial loss resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These programs are designed to promote confidence on the part of both consumers, who will be reimbursed in certain circumstances, such as not receiving their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, as well as merchants, who will receive payment in certain circumstances, such as establishing proof of shipment or delivery of an item to the customer. We believe that these programs are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry.\nOur ability to help protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes is designed to enhance the safety and security of our products and reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands.\nCOMPETITION\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, and innovative, and subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of consumers and merchants, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses combine or enter into new partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.\nOur business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), electronic bank transfers, credit, and installment methods), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and “card on file” services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services ranging from broader platform solutions to point solutions focused on a specific functionality or feature, including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now, pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale (such as contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field Communication (NFC) based solutions, and Quick Response (QR) code based solutions), value added services related to payments (such as payouts, payment orchestration, foreign exchange and risk solutions), virtual currencies (such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins) and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services also face competition from paper-based payments (primarily cash and checks).\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe differentiate ourselves to consumers through our broad acceptance and the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and offline payments, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our customer service, dispute resolution, and purchase protection programs; and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences. In addition, we differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences or functionality for our merchants, demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers, and support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods; through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure; and through our seller protection programs, analytics, and risk management, as well as other merchant services. We invest resources to improve our products and services and expand their acceptance, offer choice in payment options, provide excellent customer service, and build brands that both consumers and merchants trust.\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “\nWe face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” \nfor further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business.\nSTRATEGY\nOur ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, the macroeconomic environment and its impact on commerce and economic growth, consumer spending patterns, adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and commerce and payment applications on those devices, the growth of consumers and merchants globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of digital payments, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products, services, and features that consumers and merchants value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:\n•\nAccelerating growth in our branded checkout business\n:\n by improving our user experience, including by reducing friction and enhancing rewards, we will drive consumer selection and increase conversion rates for merchants. This strategy will increase our customers’ engagement with our products and services. A critical element of our overall growth strategy involves driving an increase in monthly active accounts, which we expect will contribute to growth in payment transactions, TPV, and net revenues.\n•\nExpanding our value proposition for consumers and merchants to drive daily use\n: \nby providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms, including offering purchase protection programs and simplifying their shopping experiences; by being technology and platform agnostic and by expanding and launching capabilities that allow us to process payments anywhere; by partnering with our merchants to grow and expand their business online and offline, including offering merchants risk management and seller protection programs; and by delivering payment-adjacent capabilities.\n•\nUnlocking the power of data\n:\n by responsibly utilizing data in our two-sided platform to personalize consumer offerings, we will create more value for our customers, improve the interconnectedness of our platform, and tap into new sources of revenue and profitable growth.\n•\nIncreasing offline engagement\n: \nthrough our PayPal-branded debit and credit cards, rewards programs, and seamless integration into other digital wallets that support in-store payments, we are giving consumers more reasons to use PayPal and Venmo for offline purchases. Providing consumers more opportunities to use PayPal for omnichannel purchases will help us to drive engagement.\n•\nBuilding and expanding strategic partnerships\n:\n \nby building new strategic partnerships and deepening existing ones to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments and commerce ecosystem. \n•\nOne PayPal platform:\n by investing in state-of-the-art technology, architecture, and processes to deliver high-quality products and services to our customers more efficiently and effectively.\n•\nSeeking new areas of growth\n:\n innovate the future of commerce by focusing on creating new products in both the digital and physical worlds and finding opportunities to expand and improve upon our existing products and capabilities.\n8\nTable of Contents\nTECHNOLOGY\nOur payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of consumers and merchants worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial services providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in approximately 200 markets around the world and in approximately 140 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 57 currencies, and hold balances in their eligible PayPal accounts in 24 currencies. \nWe have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction management databases, and payment network integrations on our platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust solutions to our global ecosystem of consumers and merchants, while at the same time helping to maintain the security of our customers’ information. \nThe technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform is designed to simplify the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitate the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and when hosted by third-party cloud service providers. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime and help ensure the resiliency of our payments platform in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and payments platform against cybersecurity threats, which includes regularly testing our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. \nFor additional information regarding risks relating to our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition\n” and “\nBusiness interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business\n.”\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOur total research and development expense was $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.7 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws, regulations, and administrative procedures in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and many international jurisdictions. We also have an active program to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed and continue to file patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.\nFor additional information regarding risks relating to our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “\nThird parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights\n” and “\nWe may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property\n.”\n9\nTable of Contents\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nGovernment regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.\nPayments regulation.\n \nVarious laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only our PayPal-branded products and services, but also our Venmo, Hyperwallet, Xoom, and Zettle products and services, to the extent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions on the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal’s service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or Venmo account. In the State of New York, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state. \nOutside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People’s Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.\nIn addition, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented payment authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.\nFinancial Services supervision\n.\n \nWe serve our customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (“PayPal (Europe)”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg by the CSSF.\n \nWe serve our customers in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited (“PayPal U.K.”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution in the U.K. by the FCA. Accordingly, we must comply with rules and regulations applicable to electronic money institutions in the U.K. and credit institutions in the E.U., including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, consumer rights, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to financial services-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial services industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.\nLending regulation\n. \nOur U.S. consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection, and PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender for this product. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal’s consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity. Paidy, Inc. holds multiple licenses for the issuance of its consumer installment products in Japan and is registered with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary. \n10\nTable of Contents\nOur U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment product is subject to federal and state laws and is offered by an independent chartered financial institution. PayPal’s interest-bearing installment product for consumers in Germany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe). \nPayPal and Venmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.\nOur U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant lending products offered in Germany, France, and the Netherlands are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., respectively. Our merchant lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and is originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).\n \nThe CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, we are subject to the direct supervisory authority of the CFPB. The CFPB and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may materially impact our business. \nAnti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions.\n \nPayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\nInterchange fees.\n \nInterchange fees (the transaction fees for processing credit and debit card transactions) are subject to regulation in certain jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions. Interchange fees are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.\nData protection and privacy.\n \nWe are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (“privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants’ customers, and employees (“personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting or amending data protection and privacy legislation or regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.\nAnti-corruption. \nPayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAdditional regulatory developments.\n \nVarious regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, competition, and marketing, which may impact PayPal’s business. Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to environmental, social, and governance matters, and corporate sustainability performance, transparency, and reporting (e.g., the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), as well as topical reporting and risk management disclosure requirements, such as obligations related to disclosure of the management of climate-related risks.\nFor an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors\n” \nand “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included in this Form 10-K.\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT MANAGEMENT\nPayPal is committed to creating a more inclusive digital economy for the customers and communities we serve across the world. Our management of priority Corporate Sustainability & Impact (“CS&I”) risks and opportunities in respect of our business is organized across employees and culture, social impact, responsible business practices, and environmental sustainability. We believe this integrated, enterprise-wide approach to managing our global business helps enable us to create value for our stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, partners, and communities. We continue to prioritize efforts to manage key non-financial factors impacting our long-term business, including fostering an inclusive culture across the employee experience, utilizing PayPal’s unique capabilities and resources to support inclusive entrepreneurship and small business success, further enhancements to support the safety and security of our products and platform, and progress on reducing our environmental impacts. We endeavor to provide transparent disclosures with respect to our CS&I risks and opportunities through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications.\nHUMAN CAPITAL \nAt PayPal, we consider the management of our global talent (human capital) to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 24,400 people globally, with 44% in the Americas, 44% in Asia-Pacific, and 12% in Europe and the Middle East. Our global employees work predominantly full-time and represent at least 140 nationalities, across 28 countries, including approximately 8,900 located in the U.S. Across our workforce, we reached approximately 43% global gender diversity and 55% U.S. ethnic diversity, as of December 31, 2024. \nAs a leading technology platform, we compete for top talent from around the world. We believe that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enable advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful acquisition, development, and retention of global talent. In 2024, we continued to build employee awareness and engagement in our leadership principles to establish a common set of expectations for all employees. We also continued to integrate these principles across our global talent strategy to help shape our programs throughout the employee lifecycle and achieve key business priorities. We use employee feedback to directly inform the ongoing development of our employee programs. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather input from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on specific topics.\nWe remain focused on promoting the holistic well-being of our employees, including providing resources, programs, and services to support our employees’ physical, mental, and financial wellness.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in this report. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” and “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations focuses on a discussion of 2024 results as compared to 2023 results. For a discussion of 2023 results as compared to 2022 results, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nTHE COMPANY\nAt PayPal, our mission is to revolutionize commerce globally. Our products are designed to enable digital payments and simplify commerce experiences for consumers and merchants to make selling, shopping, and sending and receiving money simple, personalized, and secure, online or offline, including mobile. Our two-sided platform serves millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.\nRegulatory environment\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nCybersecurity and information security\nCybersecurity and information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and enable us to effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity incidents and remain subject to these risks. There can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient protection or security to prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our cybersecurity and information security risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition\n” and “Item 1C. Cybersecurity.”\n32\nTable of Contents\nOVERVIEW OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercent Increase/(Decrease)\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)\nNet revenues\n$\n31,797 \n$\n29,771 \n$\n27,518 \n7 \n%\n8 \n%\nOperating expenses\n26,472 \n24,743 \n23,681 \n7 \n%\n4 \n%\nOperating income\n5,325 \n5,028 \n3,837 \n6 \n%\n31 \n%\nOperating margin\n17 \n%\n17 \n%\n14 \n%\n**\n**\nOther income (expense), net\n4 \n383 \n(471)\n(99)\n%\n181 \n%\nIncome tax expense\n1,182 \n1,165 \n947 \n1 \n%\n23 \n%\nEffective tax rate\n22 \n%\n22 \n%\n28 \n%\n**\n**\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4,147 \n$\n4,246 \n$\n2,419 \n(2)\n%\n76 \n%\nNet income (loss) per diluted share\n$\n3.99 \n$\n3.84 \n$\n2.09 \n4 \n%\n84 \n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n7,450 \n$\n4,843 \n$\n5,813 \n54 \n%\n(17)\n%\nAll amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.\n** Not meaningful.\nNet revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume (“TPV”, as defined below under “Key Metrics”) of 10%. \nTotal operating expenses increased $1.7 billion, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, and to a lesser extent, restructuring and other, partially offset by a reduction in transaction and credit losses. \nOperating income increased $297 million, or 6%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to net revenues increasing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin remained consistent at 17% for both 2024 and 2023.\nNet income decreased $99 million, or 2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to the previously discussed increase in operating income of $297 million and a decrease of $379 million in other income (expense), net, driven primarily by net losses on strategic investments in the current period as compared to net gains on strategic investments in the prior period.\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES\nWe have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, subjecting us to foreign exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar versus foreign currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, we generated approximately 43%, 42%, and 43% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S., respectively. Because we generate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S., including those discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” \nWe calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our business using prior period foreign exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues or operating expenses (as applicable) in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the year-over-year foreign exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n(Unfavorable) favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)\n$\n(18)\n$\n128 \nHedging impact\n48 \n111 \nFavorable impact to net revenues \n30 \n239 \nFavorable (Unfavorable) impact to operating expense\n28 \n(29)\nNet favorable impact to operating income\n$\n58 \n$\n210 \nWhile we enter into foreign exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of this exposure.\nWe also use foreign exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.  \nGiven that we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional balance sheet foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to help offset the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. \nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign exchange rates and when transactions occur. While we have processes in place to mitigate these risks, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of any possible exposure associated with setting foreign exchange rates on our payments platform.\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (“key metrics”) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\n•\nTPV\n is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. \n•\nNumber of payment transactions\n is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. \n•\nAn\n \nactive account\n \nis an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results. \n34\nTable of Contents\n•\nNumber of payment transactions per active account\n \nreflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account. \nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment. \nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.  \nNET REVENUES\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n•\nTransaction revenues\n: \nNet transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.\n•\nRevenues from other value added services:\n \nNet revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our consumers and merchants. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:\n \n•\nThe mix of merchants, products, and services;\n•\nThe mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n•\nThe geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n•\nThe amount of our loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.\nRefer to “Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that may impact our revenue.\n35\nTable of Contents\nNet revenue analysis\nThe components of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction revenues\nTransaction revenues grew $2.0 billion, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 driven primarily by an increase in revenues of approximately $1.3 billion, $0.5 billion, and $0.2 billion from our Braintree, core PayPal, and Venmo products and services, respectively, which resulted from growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions. \nAs a result of ongoing negotiations with merchants, including our stronger focus on profitable growth, we expect lower volume and transaction revenue growth from our Braintree offerings in 2025.\nThe graphs below present the respective key metrics (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\n*Reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period.\nThe following table provides a summary of related metrics:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercent Increase/\n(Decrease)\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\nNumber of payment transactions per active account\n60.6 \n58.7 \n51.4 \n3 \n%\n14 \n%\nPercent of cross-border TPV\n(1)\n12 \n%\n12 \n%\n13 \n%\n** \n** \n(1) \nCross-border TPV occurs primarily between two PayPal accounts in different countries and includes transactions initiated through our Xoom product.\n** Not meaningful.\nWe had active accounts of 434 million and 426 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 2%. Number of payment transactions was 26.3 billion and 25.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 5%. TPV was $1.68 trillion and $1.53 trillion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 10%.\n36\nTable of Contents\nTransaction revenues growth was lower than the growth in TPV in 2024 due primarily to changes in mix from core PayPal products and services with a higher volume from large merchants, which have lower pricing. \nRevenues from other value added services\nRevenues from other value added services increased $41 million, or 1%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an approximately $380 million increase in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from higher interest rates and higher customer balances, partially offset by a decline in the revenue of approximately $160 million earned from an independent chartered financial institution (“partner institution”). Revenue from the partner institution is earned primarily through our revenue share associated with our U.S. revolving consumer credit product and PayPal and Venmo branded credit cards. Revenues from other value added services were also impacted by an approximately $180 million decline from: lower interest and fee revenue on our PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products, lower revenues from Honey, and lower revenues resulting from the sale of Happy Returns in the forth quarter of 2023.\nConsumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to our partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses recognized by the partner institution, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned in future periods. In the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner institution does not meet a minimum rate of return (“minimum return threshold”) in a particular quarter, our revenue share for that period would be zero. Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs managed by the partner institution does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter, we would be required to make a payment to the partner institution, subject to certain limitations. Through December 31, 2024, the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner institution exceeded the minimum return threshold.\nSeasonality\nThe Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2024, 2023, or 2022 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercent Increase/\n(Decrease)\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nTransaction expense\n$\n15,697 \n$\n14,385 \n$\n12,173 \n9 \n%\n18 \n%\nTransaction and credit losses\n1,442 \n1,682 \n1,572 \n(14)\n%\n7 \n%\nCustomer support and operations\n1,768 \n1,919 \n2,120 \n(8)\n%\n(9)\n%\nSales and marketing\n2,001 \n1,809 \n2,257 \n11 \n%\n(20)\n%\nTechnology and development\n2,979 \n2,973 \n3,253 \n— \n%\n(9)\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n2,147 \n2,059 \n2,099 \n4 \n%\n(2)\n%\nRestructuring and other\n438 \n(84)\n207 \n**\n(141)\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n26,472 \n$\n24,743 \n$\n23,681 \n7 \n%\n4 \n%\nTransaction expense rate\n(1)\n0.93 \n%\n0.94 \n%\n0.90 \n%\n**\n**\nTransaction and credit loss rate\n(2)\n0.09 \n%\n0.11 \n%\n0.12 \n%\n**\n**\n(1) \nTransaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV. \n(2) \nTransaction and credit loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and credit losses by TPV. \n** \nNot meaningful.\n37\nTable of Contents\nTransaction expense\nTransaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs, as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. Macroeconomic environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use, which could also impact the funding mix. \nTransaction expense increased $1.3 billion, or 9%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to Braintree, which has a higher expense rate than our other products and services, representing a larger portion of TPV. The decrease in transaction expense rate in 2024 compared to 2023 was attributable to favorable changes in regional mix, product mix, and certain third-party pricing incentives within our core PayPal products and services. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 37%, 36%, and 35% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. \nTransaction and credit losses\nTransaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Credit losses include the current expected credit losses associated with our consumer and merchant loans receivable portfolio. Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, product mix, current and projected macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment rates, retail e-commerce sales and household disposable income, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants. Estimating our current expected credit loss allowances for our loans receivable portfolios is an inherently uncertain process and the ultimate losses we incur may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the ultimate losses incurred. A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or other factors beyond those considered in our estimates could result in credit losses that exceed our current estimated credit losses and adversely impact our future operating results. \n38\nTable of Contents\nThe components of our transaction and credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction and credit losses decreased $240 million, or 14%, in 2024 compared to 2023. \nTransaction losses were approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $78 million, or 7%. Transaction loss rate (transaction losses divided by TPV) was 0.07%, 0.08%, and 0.09% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The decrease in transaction losses and the associated transaction loss rate in 2024 was primarily due to lower losses from our Venmo products and services resulting from enhanced risk mitigation strategies.\nCredit losses decreased $162 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The components of credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(3)\n2022\nNet charge-offs\n(1)\n$\n372 \n$\n549 \n$\n267 \nReserve (release) build\n(2)\n(44)\n(59)\n135 \nCredit losses\n$\n328 \n$\n490 \n$\n402 \n(1) \nNet charge-offs includes principal charge-offs partially offset by recoveries for consumer and merchant receivables. \n(2) \nReserve (release) build represents change in allowance for principal receivables excluding foreign currency remeasurement.\n(3) \nIncludes changes in the allowance due to the reclassification of loans and interest receivable to or from held for sale.\nCredit losses in the year ended December 31, 2024 were primarily attributable to loan originations during the period partially offset by improvement in the credit quality of loans outstanding. Credit losses in the year ended December 31, 2023 were primarily attributable to loan originations during the period and a deterioration in the credit quality of loans outstanding. \nConsumer loan portfolio\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivables, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a 24-month commitment period (collectively, “eligible consumer installment receivables”). In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale was $541 million and $563 million, respectively. \n39\nTable of Contents\nThe consumer loans and interest receivable balance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, net of participation interest sold, reflecting an increase of 13%. The increase was driven primarily by growth of approximately $390 million and $250 million in our installment credit products driven by growth in Japan and the U.S., respectively, as well as growth of approximately $170 million in our revolving credit product in the U.K., partially offset by a decline of approximately $180 million in our installment credit products in Germany due to the forward-flow arrangement with the global investment firm. \nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nPercent of consumer loans and interest receivable current\n96.6 \n%\n95.4 \n%\nPercent of consumer loans and interest receivable > 90 days outstanding\n(1)\n1.6 \n%\n2.2 \n%\nNet charge-off rate\n(2)\n4.5 \n%\n7.2 \n%\n(1)  \nRepresents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.\n(2)\n Net charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended December 31, 2024, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance during the same period. \nThe decline in net charge-off rate for consumer receivables at December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement in credit quality of the U.S. interest-bearing installment products.\nIn response to changing portfolio performance and macroeconomic environment, we continue to monitor risk and evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters. Changes to such parameters in 2024 resulted in an increase of U.S. interest-bearing installment loan originations in 2024.\nMerchant loan portfolio\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses, which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings. Total merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, reflecting an increase of 23%. The increase was due primarily to growth of approximately $170 million in our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) product portfolio, primarily from the U.S., Germany and the U.K., as well as growth of approximately $110 million in our PPBL product in the U.S.\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable current\n90.4 \n%\n87.0 \n%\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable > 90 days outstanding\n(1)\n2.8 \n%\n5.6 \n%\nNet charge-off rate\n (2)\n5.3 \n%\n18.8 \n%\n(1)\n Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable.\n(2) \nNet charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended December 31, 2024, excluding fraud losses, on merchant loans and advances as a percentage of the average daily amount of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance during the same period.\nThe increase in the percent of current merchant receivables and decrease in percent of merchant receivables greater than 90 days outstanding and the net charge-off rate for merchant receivables at December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement in underwriting and credit quality of the PPBL portfolio. \nIn response to changing portfolio performance and macroeconomic environment, we continue to monitor risk and evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters. Changes to such parameters resulted in an increase in PPBL originations in 2024.\nFor additional information, see “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—\nOur credit products expose us to additional risks\n” included in this Form 10-K. \n40\nTable of Contents\nCustomer support and operations\nCustomer support and operations includes costs incurred in our global customer operations centers, including costs to provide call support to our customers, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our consumers and merchants, and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products, including payment devices, card production, and customer onboarding and compliance costs.\nCustomer support and operations expenses decreased $151 million, or 8%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs of approximately $100 million associated with a headcount reduction. The decline in customer support and operations expenses year-over-year was also impacted by a reduction in other costs incurred related to delivery of our products, including warehouses, shipping, and payment devices and a decrease in contractors and consulting costs, partially offset by an increase in customer onboarding and compliance costs and card issuance costs.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing includes costs incurred for customer acquisition, business development, advertising, and marketing programs. \nSales and marketing expenses increased $192 million, or 11%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to higher spend of approximately $260 million on marketing and brand advertising, including the launch of our PayPal Everywhere advertising campaign, partially offset by a decline in employee-related costs. \n41\nTable of Contents\nTechnology and development\nTechnology and development includes costs incurred in connection with the development of our payments platform, new products, and the improvement of our existing products, including the amortization of software and website development costs incurred in developing our payments platform, which are capitalized. It also includes acquired developed technology and our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our payments platform.\nTechnology and development expenses remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs associated with headcount reduction offset by an increase in costs related to contractors and consultants and software maintenance costs.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative includes costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk and compliance, executive, and other support operations. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $88 million, or 4%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in professional services expense, a contingency reserve, and indirect tax expense, partially offset by a decline in depreciation expense and facilities costs. \nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other primarily consist of restructuring expenses, asset impairment charges, gain on sale of divested business, and losses on loans and interest receivable, held for sale. \n42\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring and other increased $522 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily resulting from restructuring charges and fair value adjustments on loans and interest receivable, held for sale and a gain on sale of a divested business, in which we recorded a pre-tax gain of $339 million in 2023 with no comparable activity in the current period. \nDuring the first quarter of 2024, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations, focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure. The associated restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $307 million and included employee severance and benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2024. The estimated reduction in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately $575 million, including approximately $165 million in stock-based compensation. We reinvested a portion of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce to drive business priorities.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $122 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. \nFor information on the associated restructuring liabilities, see “Note 17—Restructuring and Other” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of nil and $61 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease assets and related leasehold improvements. \nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain of $17 million due to the sale of an owned property. We also incurred a loss of $14 million related to another owned property, which was previously held for sale, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $129 million and $74 million of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale (inclusive of transaction costs) and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value. \nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net of $4 million in 2024 decreased $379 million compared to $383 million in 2023. This decline in other income (expense), net was due primarily to net losses and impairments on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period, which contributed a decline of approximately $490 million year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately $180 million resulting from an increase in average cash balances and interest rates year-over-year.\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate was 22% in both 2024 and 2023. Our effective income tax rate in 2024 remained consistent compared to 2023 and was impacted primarily by changes in jurisdictional mix of income, U.S. income taxed at different rates, discrete tax adjustments, and tax expense in prior period associated with sale of a divested business. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third-party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond. \n43\nTable of Contents\nSOURCES OF LIQUIDITY\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments\n(1)(2)\n$\n13,846 \n$\n15,493 \n(1) \nExcludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of $37.7 billion and $38.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) \nExcludes total restricted cash of $1 million and $3 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and strategic investments of\n \n$1.6 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $8.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and $10.0 billion at December 31, 2023, or 62% and 64%, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2024, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) or the one-time transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective except for any tax on foreign exchange gains and losses; however, they may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax.\nA significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. Accordingly, not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n7,450 \n$\n4,843 \n$\n5,813 \nInvesting activities\n1,589 \n752 \n(3,328)\nFinancing activities\n(8,276)\n(2,993)\n(1,203)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(207)\n76 \n(155)\nNet change  in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n556 \n$\n2,678 \n$\n1,127 \nOperating activities\nCash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and credit losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, originations and proceeds from repayments and sales of loans and interest receivable held for sale, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as changes in other assets and liabilities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for credit losses are estimates of current expected credit losses on our consumer and merchant credit products. Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products have no impact on cash from operating activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities grew $2.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to changes in deferred taxes of approximately $900 million, changes in working capital of approximately $760 million, an increase of approximately $530 million in sales and repayments of loans receivable held for sale, net of originations, and an impact of approximately $490 million from losses on strategic investments. \nCash paid for income taxes, net in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $1.0 billion, $2.1 billion, and $878 million, respectively.\n44\nTable of Contents\nInvesting activities\nCash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments; cash paid for acquisitions and strategic investments; purchases and sales of property and equipment; purchases, originations, sales, and principal repayment of loans receivable, originally classified as held for investment; changes in funds receivable; changes in collateral posted related to derivative instruments, net; and purchases and maturities of reverse repurchase agreements. \nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $837 million in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase of $5.9 billion from changes related to funds receivable, partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 billion in sales and repayments of loans receivables, net of purchases and originations, and an increase of $1.6 billion in purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities.\nFinancing activities\nCash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers, changes in collateral received related to derivative instruments, net, and borrowings and repayments under repurchase agreements. \nNet cash used in financing activities increased $5.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a decrease of $3.8 billion from changes related to funds payable and amounts due to customers, an increase of $1.0 billion in share repurchases of our common stock, and an increase of approximately $590 million in repayments, net of borrowings under financing arrangements.\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nForeign exchange rates had a negative impact of $207 million and positive impact of $76 million on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during 2024 and 2023, respectively. The negative impact in 2024 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the British pound and Euro. The positive impact in 2023 was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the British pound. \nAvailable credit and debt\nIn June 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $600 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and as such, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. \nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of ¥60.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥30.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of ¥90.0 billion (approximately $574 million as of December 31, 2024). In the year ended December 31, 2024, ¥90.0 billion (approximately $574 million) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2024, no borrowing capacity was available under the Paidy Credit Agreement. \nWe maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with a borrowing capacity of approximately $80 million in the aggregate, where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\nIn May 2024, June 2023, May 2022, May 2020 and September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates  (collectively referred to as the “Notes”). Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments. As of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of $10.6 billion in fixed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates. \nFor additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. \n45\nTable of Contents\nDepending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program, or reduce our cost of capital.\nCredit ratings\nAs of December 31, 2024, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements.\nCURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\nOur material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, capital expenditures, and other future obligations.\nCredit products \nGrowth in our portfolio of loans receivable increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products. \nThe Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) has agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 50% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities was $2.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and represented approximately 26% and 39% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use as of those respective dates, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to change the designation of amounts of European customer balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances. \nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio. In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold $20.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of loans and interest receivable in connection with this agreement. For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWhile our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. \nCustomer protection programs\nThe risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rate ranged between 0.07% and 0.09% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. \nStock repurchases \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately $6.0 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of December 31, 2024, a total of approximately $4.9 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program. For additional information, see “Note 14—Stock Repurchase Programs” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. \n46\nTable of Contents\nFuture obligations \nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2024 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations. \nPurchase\nObligations\nLeases\nTransition Tax\nLong-term Debt\nTotal\nPayments Due During the Year Ending December 31,\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n849 \n$\n171 \n354 \n$\n1,542 \n$\n2,916 \n2026\n578 \n177 \n— \n1,738 \n2,493 \n2027\n131 \n159 \n— \n797 \n1,087 \n2028\n11 \n109 \n— \n522 \n642 \n2029\n3 \n88 \n— \n1,785 \n1,876 \nThereafter\n5 \n198 \n— \n9,263 \n9,466 \n$\n1,577 \n$\n902 \n$\n354 \n$\n15,647 \n$\n18,480 \nThe significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:\n•\nPurchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for cloud computing services, advertising, and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.\n•\nLease amounts include primarily minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases primarily for office and data center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.\n•\nTransition tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act. \n•\nLong-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt. For more information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. \nAs we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $2.6 billion recorded in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.\nOther considerations\nOur liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1\n—\nOverview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10\n‑\nK.\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and such estimates require regular review and adjustment.\nALLOWANCE FOR TRANSACTION AND CREDIT LOSSES\nTransaction and credit losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, product mix, current and projected macroeconomic conditions, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include revolving and installment credit products offered to consumers at checkout, as well as merchant loans and advances arising from the PPWC and PPBL products.\nWe establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection program claims, account takeovers, and bank returns and reversals. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving collection and write-off patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as well as current and projected macroeconomic factors, as appropriate.\nWe also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable and includes expected credit losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we utilized externally published projections of forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, forecasted U.S. and U.K. retail e-commerce sales, and forecasted U.K. household disposable income, among others, over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 7% and 9%, respectively. A significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances. An increase of 1% in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately $69 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n48\nTable of Contents\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES \nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax. \nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nBased on our results for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase in our income tax expense of $53 million would have resulted in a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWe are regularly involved in various claims, regulatory and legal proceedings, and investigations of potential violations by regulatory oversight authorities. On a regular basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding, or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other violations and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes.\n49\nTable of Contents\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nApplication of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants. Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration payable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded when earned, based on management’s estimate of each customer’s future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual customer performance, amendments to existing contracts, or the execution of new contracts. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. \nEVALUATION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT\nWe have strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, which include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Measurement Alternative). We review these investments regularly to determine if impairment has occurred. We assess whether an impairment loss on these non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies, has occurred based on qualitative factors such as the companies’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the company. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of these non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach. If any impairment is identified, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.
