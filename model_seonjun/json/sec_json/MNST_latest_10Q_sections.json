Gross billings are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The use of gross billings allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices.

However, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. In addition, our continued growth internationally may further reduce the impact of seasonality on our business. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in advertising and promotional expenses.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThree-Months Ended \n​\nNine-Months Ended \n(In thousands, except average net sales per case)\n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\nNet sales\n​\n$\n 2,197,139\n​\n$\n 1,880,973\n​\n$\n 6,163,290\n​\n$\n 5,680,668\nLess: Alcohol Brands segment sales\n​\n​\n (33,009)\n​\n​\n (39,784)\n​\n​\n (105,683)\n​\n​\n (137,417)\nLess: Other segment sales\n​\n \n (6,786)\n​\n \n (5,930)\n​\n \n (19,169)\n​\n \n (18,467)\nAdjusted net sales\n1\n​\n$\n 2,157,344\n​\n$\n 1,835,259\n​\n$\n 6,038,438\n​\n$\n 5,524,784\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCase sales by segment:\n1\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n  \nMonster Energy® Drinks\n​\n \n 201,310\n​\n \n 172,587\n​\n \n 562,395\n​\n \n 507,970\nStrategic Brands\n​\n \n 57,077\n​\n \n 46,822\n​\n \n 158,428\n​\n \n 135,063\nTotal case sales\n​\n \n 258,387\n​\n \n 219,409\n​\n \n 720,823\n​\n \n 643,033\nAverage net sales per case - Energy Drinks\n​\n$\n 8.35\n​\n$\n 8.36\n​\n$\n 8.38\n​\n$\n 8.59\n​\n1\nExcludes Alcohol Brands segment and Other segment net sales.\nNet changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on the overall average net sales per case for the three-months ended September 30, 2025 and an unfavorable impact on the overall average net sales per case for the nine-months ended September 30, 2025.\nThe following represents case sales for our craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers, in 192-ounce equivalents:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThree-Months Ended \n​\nNine-Months Ended \n(In thousands, except average net sales per case)\n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\nAlcohol Brands segment net sales\n​\n$\n 33,009\n​\n$\n 39,784\n​\n$\n 105,683\n​\n$\n 137,417\nCase sales\n​\n \n 2,362\n​\n \n 2,845\n​\n \n 7,565\n​\n \n 9,967\nAverage net sales per case - Alcohol Brands\n​\n$\n 13.98\n​\n$\n 13.98\n​\n$\n 13.97\n​\n$\n 13.79\n​\nSee Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations” for additional information related to net sales.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents. \nAt September 30, 2025, we had $2.29 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $286.4 million in short-term investments, and $359.2 million in long-term investments, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. treasuries and corporate bonds. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess the market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOf our $2.29 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at September 30, 2025, $1.15 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at September 30, 2025.\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLong-term debt. \nIn May 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other lenders (the \n“\nOriginal Credit Agreement\n”\n), which provided for senior unsecured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion (collectively, the \n“\nCredit Facilities\n”\n). The Credit Facilities previously consisted of a $750.0 million term loan (the \n“\nTerm Loan\n”\n) and up to $750.0 million in multicurrency revolving loan commitments (the \n“\nRevolving Credit Facility\n”\n). The Term Loan was repaid in April 2025 with no additional borrowings permitted. In addition, pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the Original Credit Agreement, dated as of October 17, 2025, among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other lenders (the \n“\nAmended Credit Agreement\n”\n), the Company\n’\ns aggregate borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility has been reduced to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the applicable rate plus margin (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). Borrowings may be repaid at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility and may be reborrowed prior to the maturity date, which is set to occur in May 2029. As of September 30, 2025, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facilities, and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of November 5, 2025, the Revolving Credit Facility had remaining availability of $500.0 million.\nWe believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and access to credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development requirements, purchases of capital assets, purchases of equipment, purchases of real property and purchases of shares of our common stock, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, we estimate that capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be less than $250.0 million through September 30, 2026. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.\nPurchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property, plant and manufacturing equipment, and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the nine-months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (in thousands):\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\nOperating activities\n​\n$\n 1,718,762\n​\n$\n 1,466,832\nInvesting activities\n​\n$\n (719,248)\n​\n$\n 843,018\nFinancing activities\n​\n$\n (312,601)\n​\n$\n (2,967,704)\n​\nCash flows provided by operating activities. \nCash provided by operating activities was $1.72 billion for the nine-months ended September 30, 2025, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024.\nFor the nine-months ended September 30, 2025, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $1.46 billion and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting primarily of $92.3 million of depreciation and amortization and non-cash lease expense and $86.7 million of stock-based compensation. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2025, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $148.6 million increase in accounts payable, a $105.8 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $98.5 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $58.4 million decrease in inventories, a $33.4 million increase in income taxes payable, and a $14.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2025, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $299.1 million increase in accounts receivable, a $66.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $15.9 million decrease in deferred revenue.\nFor the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $1.24 billion and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting primarily of $69.6 million of depreciation and amortization and non-cash lease expense and $68.8 million of stock-based compensation. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $197.1 million decrease in inventories, a $46.7 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $31.5 million increase in accrued promotional allowances and a $4.2 million increase in income taxes payable. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $106.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $39.7 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $14.3 million decrease in accounts payable, a $12.7 million \n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndecrease in deferred revenue, a $6.0 million decrease in accrued compensation, a $5.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a $2.4 million decrease in other liabilities.\nCash flows (used in) provided by investing activities. \nCash used in investing activities was $719.2 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $843.0 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024.\nFor both the nine-months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-sale investments. To a lesser extent, for both the nine-months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, equipment used for sales and administrative activities, certain leasehold improvements, as well as construction of and/or improvements to real property. For both the nine-months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales of available-for-sale investments. We expect to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products) to develop our brand in international markets and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also use cash to purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses.\nCash flows used in financing activities. \nCash used in financing activities was $312.6 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $2.97 billion for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024. The cash used in financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to repayments on the Credit Facilities and, to a lesser extent, repurchases of our common stock. The cash used in financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of repurchases of our common stock. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock under our stock-based compensation plans. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to borrowings under the Credit Facilities and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of our common stock under our stock-based compensation plans.\nThe following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of September 30, 2025:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPayments due by period (in thousands)\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nLess than\n    \n1‑3 \n    \n3‑5 \n    \nMore than\nObligations\n​\nTotal\n​\n1 year\n \nyears\n \nyears\n \n5 years\nContractual Obligations\n1\n​\n$\n 481,065\n​\n$\n 253,654\n​\n$\n 152,093\n​\n$\n 72,672\n​\n$\n 2,646\nFinance Leases\n​\n \n 3,959\n​\n \n 3,928\n​\n \n 23\n​\n \n 8\n​\n \n —\nOperating Leases\n​\n \n 56,364\n​\n \n 14,230\n​\n \n 20,677\n​\n \n 13,494\n​\n \n 7,963\nPurchase Commitments\n2\n​\n \n 225,314\n​\n \n 136,509\n​\n \n 86,062\n​\n \n 2,743\n​\n \n —\n​\n​\n$\n 766,702\n​\n$\n 408,321\n​\n$\n 258,855\n​\n$\n 88,917\n​\n$\n 10,609\n​\n1\nContractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments.\n2\nPurchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms but are generally satisfied within one year.\nIn addition, approximately $4.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of September 30, 2025. It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change within the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2025, we had $1.0 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates from the information provided in “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (“Form 10-K”).\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1. Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nInflation\nWe believe inflation did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (the “Exchange Act”) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, and adequacy of funds from operations and the Revolving Credit Facility, among other things. All statements containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items, a statement of management’s plans and objectives for future operations, or a statement of future economic performance contained in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including statements related to new products, volume growth and statements encompassing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Exchange Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “thinks,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “estimates” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nManagement cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control and involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following:\n·\nour ability to sustain and/or surpass the current level of sales of our products, to adapt to changing consumer preferences, and to effectively respond to competitive products and pricing pressures;\n·\nour ability to implement our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and new sectors and achieving profitability within our Alcohol Brands segment;\n·\nour ability to adapt to the changing retail landscape with the rapid growth in e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites;\n·\nour ability to absorb, reduce or pass on to our bottlers/distributors increases in commodity costs, including freight costs;\n·\nthe impact of the current U.S. presidential administration’s policies on our energy drinks due to concerns about sugar-sweetened beverages, particular ingredients, such as food dyes, and the “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) process;\n·\nthe impact of proposed or adopted domestic and/or foreign legislation to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks (including the prohibition of the sale of energy drinks to certain demographics, at certain establishments, in certain container sizes or pursuant to certain governmental programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP));\n·\nthe impact of changes in U.S. trade policies and the threat or imposition of tariffs on, among other things, our supply chain, input costs, inflation or consumer demand for our products;\n·\nthe imposition of new and/or increased excise sales and/or other taxes on our products;\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\n·\nour extensive commercial arrangements with The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) and, as a result, our future performance’s substantial dependence on the success of our relationship with TCCC;\n·\nthe effects of unilateral decisions by bottlers/distributors and/or retailers on our business, including their distribution and placement of our products, their consolidation, their discontinuation, or restriction of the range of, all or any of our products that they carry, their limitations on the sale or sizes of our products, and/or their devotion of less resources to the sale of our products;\n·\nchanges in the price and/or availability of raw materials and other supply chain issues, such as the availability of products, suitable production facilities and/or co-packing arrangements;\n·\npossible recalls of our products and/or the consequences and costs of defective production;\n·\ndisruption to our manufacturing facilities and operations related to climate, labor, production difficulties, capacity limitations, regulations or other causes;\n·\ndisruption to and/or lack of effectiveness of our information technology systems, including internal and external cybersecurity threats and breaches;\n·\nadverse publicity surrounding obesity, alcohol consumption and other health concerns related to our products, product safety and quality;\n·\nliabilities resulting from legal or regulatory proceedings, government investigations, and/or injunctions;\n·\nthe inherent operational risks presented by the alcoholic beverage industry that may not be adequately covered by insurance or lead to litigation relating to the abuse or misuse of our products;\n·\nthe current uncertainty and volatility in the national and global economy and changes in demand due to such economic conditions, including a slowdown in consumer spending generally; and\n·\nthe impact of military conflicts, including supply chain disruptions, volatility in commodity prices, increased economic uncertainty and escalating geopolitical tensions.\nThe foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC is not exhaustive. See “Part II, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.\n​\nI"
