  "item1": "Item 1: Business \nW.W. Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad line, distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.\nFor financial information regarding the Company, see the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nThe Grainger Edge\nGrainger's strategic framework, “The Grainger Edge,” uniquely defines the Company by asserting why it exists, how it serves customers and how team members work together to achieve its objectives. Grainger’s purpose is We Keep the World Working®, which in turn allows customers to focus on the core of their businesses and do what they do best. \nThis framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities as Grainger executes its strategy and creates value for shareholders. For further information on the Company's principles, see below \"Human Capital - Workplace Practices and Policies.\"\nGeneral\nGrainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) and Endless Assortment. These reportable segments align with Grainger's go-to-market strategies and bifurcated business models of high-touch solutions and endless assortment. \nFor further segment information, see Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nBelow is a description of Grainger’s reportable segments and other businesses. \nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A. \nThe Company's High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment provides value-added MRO solutions that are rooted in deep product knowledge and customer expertise. The high-touch solutions model serves customers with complex buying needs. This segment primarily includes the Grainger-branded businesses in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.\nEndless Assortment \nThe Company’s Endless Assortment segment provides a streamlined and transparent online platform with one-stop shopping for millions of products. The Endless Assortment segment includes the Company’s Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) online channels which operate predominately in the U.S. and Japan.\nOther\nOther businesses is primarily comprised of the Company's \nCromwell business in the U.K. and a wholly owned captive insurance entity\n. \nThese businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment.\n 4\nBusiness Models\nCompeting with both high-touch solutions and endless assortment business models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. The following provides a high-level view of the Company's busin\ness models:\n 5\nCustomers\nThe Company uses a c\nombination of its two business models to serve its more than 4.5 million \ncu\nstomers worldwide which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations. Grainger’s customers range from smaller businesses to large corporations, government entities and other institutions, representing a broad collection of industries, including, but not limited to commercial, healthcare, and manufacturing. No single end customer accounted fo\nr \nmore than 10%\n of to\ntal sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, customers are typically mid-size and large businesses with complex purchasing operations and processes. Many customers served in this segment expect product and service depth and are focused on total cost\n of procurement.\n C\nustomers in this segment utilize sophisticated electronic purchasing platforms that communicate directly with Grainger.com through eProcurement technology. \nSales and service representatives drive relationships with customers by helping select the right products and reducing costs by utilizing Grainger as a consistent source of supply. KeepStock\n®, Grainger's inventory management\n solution, serves customers on site, offering valuable insights to drive efficiencies and cost savings. The North American Customer Service Centers handle customer interactions for the region via phone, email, eCommerce portals and online chat. \nIn the Endless Assortment segment, customers are typically smaller and mid-size businesses with less complex purchasing operations and processes. Customers served in this segment have straight-forward product and service needs. Additionally, MonotaRO continues to attract and retain large enterprise customers. Customers purchasing through the endless assortment platforms are focused on transparent pricing and an easy-to-navigate procurement process. MonotaRO and Zoro offer an innovative customer experience by allowing customers to quickly find competitively priced products through intuitive business-focused eCommerce platforms with intelligent analytic capabilities.\nProducts and Services\nGrainger’s product offering is grouped under several broad categories,\n including safety and security, material handling and storage, pumps and plumbing equipment, cleaning and maintenance, metalworking and hand tools. \nProducts are regularly added and removed from Grainger's product lines based on customer demand, market research, suppliers' recommendations and other factors. No single product category comprised \nmore than 20% \nof the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, Grainger.com provides real-time price\n and product availability, detailed product information and features, such as product search and compare capabilities. The high-touch solutions businesses offer approximately 2 million products and several services, such as technical support and inventory management.\nIn the Endless Assortment segment, Grainger offers an expansive product assortment that contains millions of products including those outside of traditional industrial MRO categories. Zoro offers more than 14 million products and MonotaRO provides access to more than 24 million products, primarily through its websites and catalogs. The endless assortment businesses continue to enhance assortment by strategically ad\nding products and expanding the offer of third party held products.\nDistribution and Sources of Supply\nIn the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger holds an advantaged position with its supply chain infrastructure and a broad in-stock product offering\n. More than 5,000\n primary suppliers worldwide provide Grainger businesses with \nmore than 1.4 million \nproducts stocked in Distribution Centers (DCs) and branches globally. No single supplier comprised\n more than 5% \nof Grainger's total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, DCs are the primary order fulfillment channel, mainly through direct shipments to customers. Automation in the DCs allows orders to ship complete with next-day delivery and also replenish branches that provide same-day availability to customers. Grainger’s North American distribution network supplies inventory planning and management, transportation and distribution services to all Grainger businesses in the North American region. Branches serve the immediate needs of customers by allowing them to directly pick up items and leverage branch staff for their technical product expertise and search-and-select support. Addit\nionally, \n 6\nGrainger offers comprehensive inventory management through its KeepStock® program that includes vendor-managed inventory, customer-managed inventory and onsite vending machines\n.\nIn the Endless Assortment segment, orders are placed primarily through online channels. Zoro leverages the High-Touch Solution N.A.'s DC network and third-party drop shipments to deliver seamless service and product fulfillment to customers. MonotaRO fulfills customer orders through local DCs and third-party drop shipments.\nFor further information on the Company’s properties, see Part I, Item 2: Properties of this Form 10-K.\nTrademarks and Service Marks \nGrainger conducts business under various trademarks and service marks. Approximately 20% of 2024 sales were private label MRO items bearing Grainger’s registered trademarks, including DAYTON®, GRAINGER®, CONDOR®, WESTWARD®, TOUGH GUY®, SPEEDAIRE®, LUMAPRO®, and AIR HANDLER®. Grainger also provides a suite of inventory services to its customers under the KEEPSTOCK® brand, which is a registered service mark. Grainger has taken steps to protect these service marks and trademarks against infringement and believes they will remain available for future use in its business.\nSeasonality\nGrainger sells products that may have seasonal demand fluctuations during the winter or summer seasons or during periods of natural disasters. However, historical seasonality impacts have not been material to Grainger’s operating results.\nCompetition\nGrainger faces competition from a variety of competitors, including manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers and internet-based businesses. Also, competitors vary by size, from large broad line distributors and eCommerce retailers to small local and regional competitors. Grainger differentiates itself by providing local product availability, a broad product line, sales and service representatives and advanced electronic and eCommerce technology. Grainger also offers other services, such as inventory management and technical support. \nGovernment Regulations\nGrainger’s business is subject to a wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. based operations, which in 2024 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico and the U.K., and through its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan. Compliance with these laws, regulations and standards requires the dedication of time and effort of team members as well as financial resources. In 2024, compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and standards did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors \nof this Form 10-K for \na discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact Grainger.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company strongly believes that its corporate culture must be aligned with its business strategy and aspiration to create value. To that end, Grainger's Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management are actively involved in cultivating Grainger’s culture. The Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees the Company's human capital management programs and policies and routinely provides updates to the Board.  \nGrainger believes that a purpose-driven culture is an asset that creates a sustainable, competitive advantage for the Company. Building on its strong foundation while evolving a framework to address the future is critical to Grainger’s continued success. Grainger has been consistently recognized for its commitment to its culture, an inclusive workplace and team member engagement.\nTeam Member Profile\nAs of December 31, 2024, Gr\nainger had more than 26,000 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 23,500 were full-time and 3,000 were part-time or temporary. Approximately 85% of these team members are located in North America, 9% in Asia and 6% in Europe.\n 7\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company's strategic framework, The Grainger Edge, outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities. This framework helps the Company execute its strategy and create value for shareholders.\nThe Grainger Edge principles work as a system and guide the Company’s actions supporting health and safety, an inclusive workplace, and team member experience, including talent acquisition, retention, development and compensation and benefits. The Grainger Edge principles are:\n•\nStart with the Customer\n•\nWin as One Team\n•\nEmbrace Curiosity\n•\nInvest in our Success\n•\nAct with Intent\n•\nDo the Right Thing\n•\nCompete with Urgency\nGrainger’s purpose-driven culture and principles help the Company attract, retain, motivate and develop its workforce and drive team member engagement. The Company believes an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company and measures team member engagement on an ongoing basis. The results from engagement surveys are used to inform programs and processes designed and implemented to enhance the culture Grainger aspires to achieve. \nHealth and Safety\nGrainger strives to provide a safe work environment in which team members are properly prepared to perform the many tasks required to support customers. The Company’s Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) program is designed to integrate EHS into Grainger’s business operations and comply with applicable regulations. To that end, the Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to confirm proper safety policies, programs and procedures. \nThe Company is focused on promoting a culture of safety and education. Operational team members must complete routine training to fully understand the expectation of behaviors defined by the Company’s global EHS policy. Managing and reducing risks at DCs and other facilities remain a core objective and injury rates continue to be low. In \n2024\n, the Company’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Incident Rate in the U\n.S. was 1.3 and the Company’s Lost Time Incident Rate in the U.S. was 0.5 based upon the number of incidents per 100 team members (or per 200,000 work hours). \nInclusive Workplace\nGrainger believes a broad talent pool is essential to live its principles, foster innovation, build high-performing teams and drive business results. The Company understands that future business success requires a mix of current and new skill sets, multiple experiences, and a broad array of backgrounds and perspectives, and strives to reflect this in its hiring, retention and promotion practices. The Company aspires to increasingly promote a welcoming, inclusive culture that values all people.\nGrainger's commitment to inclusion applies throughout the organization.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors is comprised of approximately 31% female and 23% racially and ethnically diverse directors. Grainger also maintains this commitment with the executive leadership teams. Grainger's global executive leadership team is comprised of approximately 33% women leaders. The U.S. based executive leadership team is comprised of approximately 27% racially and ethnically diverse leaders. Within Grainger’s global workforce, approximately 42% of team members were women and approximately 39% of U.S. team members were racially and ethnically diverse. \nTalent Acquisition, Retention and Development\nGrainger believes that a great customer experience starts with a great team member experience. The Company is committed to providing team members with resources designed to help them succeed. Grainger focuses on creating opportunities for team member growth, development and training, including offering a comprehensive talent program that continues throughout a team member’s career. This talent program is comprised of performance \n 8\nmanagement, career management, professional development learning opportunities and milestone leadership development programs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nGrainger believes that its futu\nre success is highly dependent upon the Company’s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate team members. As part of its efforts in these areas, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to meet the needs of team members and support their physical and mental health and well-being, financial future and work-life balance. Team members are given access to health plan resources which include 24-hour virtual health services, disease management, tobacco cessation, parental support, stress management and weight loss programs with access to online support communities. In addition, Grainger provides retirement savings, paid holidays and time off, educational assistance and income protection benefits as well as a variety of other programs.\nAvailable Information\nGrainger's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

  "item7": "Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nObjective\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger or Company) as it is viewed by the Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses \n2024\n and \n2023\n items and year-to-year comparisons between \n2024\n and \n2023\n. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between \n2023\n and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in MD&A of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nPercentage figures included in this section have not been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or in the associated text.\nOverview\nW.W. Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Grainger uses its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve customers worldwide, who rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations.\nStrategic Priorities\nThe Company’s continued strategic aspiration for 2025 is to relentlessly expand Grainger’s leadership position by being the go-to partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable, and productive operations. To achieve this, each Grainger business has a set of strategic growth drivers to drive top-line revenue and MRO market outgrowth. The High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) segment is focused on three areas: advantaged MRO solutions, differentiated sales and services, and unparalleled customer service. In the Endless Assortment segment, the business is focused on product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition and retention capabilities. Additionally, all Grainger businesses are focused on continuously enhancing our operational processes to improve service and cost through customer experience, technology and supply chain infrastructure which ultimately delivers long-term returns for shareholders.\nRecent Events\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nThe global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical conditions and events, and various economic and financial factors. These conditions have affected the Company's operations and may continue to affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. \nThe Company continues to monitor economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, changing inflationary environment, and a potential recession on the Company’s business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. The Company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects from the impact of the changing inflationary environment while remaining market price competitive. Historically, the Company’s broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the Company’s products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial MRO market. The full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFor further discussion of the Company's risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\n 27\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP (as defined below) measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures, see \"Non-GAAP Measures\n.\"\nThe following table is included as an aid to understanding the changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the twelve months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n (in millions of dollars). \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n% of Net Sales\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n(1)\n$\n17,168 \n$\n16,478 \n4.2 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of goods sold\n10,410 \n9,982 \n4.3 \n60.6 \n60.6 \nGross profit\n6,758 \n6,496 \n4.0 \n39.4 \n39.4 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n4,121 \n3,931 \n4.8 \n24.0 \n23.8 \nOperating earnings\n2,637 \n2,565 \n2.8 \n15.4 \n15.6 \nOther expense – net\n53 \n65 \n(18.5)\n0.3 \n0.4 \nIncome tax provision\n595 \n597 \n(0.3)\n3.5 \n3.6 \nNet earnings\n1,989 \n1,903 \n4.5 \n11.6 \n11.6 \nLess noncontrolling interest\n80 \n74 \n(8.1)\n0.5 \n0.5 \nNet earnings attributable to W.W.

For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see \"Non-GAAP Measures\n.\" \nFor further segment information, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\nThe following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change \nNet sales\n$\n13,720 \n$\n13,267 \n3.4 \n%\nGross profit\n5,741 \n5,546 \n3.5 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n3,356 \n3,212 \n4.5 \nOperating earnings\n$\n2,385 \n$\n2,334 \n2.2 \n%\nNet sales of $13,720 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $453 million, or 3% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to volume. \nGross profit of $5,741 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $195 million, or 4%, and gross profit margin of 41.8% was flat compared to the same period in 2023.\nSG&A of $3,356 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $144 million, or 5%, and adjusted SG&A of $3,341 million increased $155 million, or 5% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll and benefit expenses. SG&A leverage decreased 20 basis points and adjusted SG&A leverage decreased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2023.\nOperating earnings of $2,385 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $51 million, or 2%, and   adjusted operating earnings of $2,400 million increased $40 million, or 2% compared to the same period in 2023. \n 29\nEndless Assortment\nThe following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet sales\n$\n3,134 \n$\n2,916 \n7.5 \n%\nGross profit\n923 \n864 \n6.8 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n663 \n631 \n5.1 \nOperating earnings\n$\n260 \n$\n233 \n11.6 \n%\nNet sales of $3,134 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $218 million, or 7%, and on a daily constant currency basis, increased 12% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due to sales growth of 12%, driven by customer acquisition for the segment and enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange of 5% due to changes in the exchange rate between U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.\nGross profit of $923 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $59 million, or 7%, and gross profit margin of 29.5% decreased 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2023.\nSG&A of $663 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $32 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing expenses in 2024. SG&A leverage improved 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2023.\nOperating earnings of $260 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $27 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2023.\nNon-GAAP Measures \nGrainger utilizes non-GAAP measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. The Company adjusts its reported net sales when there are differences in the number of U.S. selling days relative to the prior year period and also excludes the impact on reported net sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and results of certain divested businesses. Adjusted results including adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the Company’s most directly comparable reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results. The Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Grainger’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRestructuring Actions\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded restructuring charges in SG&A of $15 million in the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment and $1 million in Grainger's Other businesses. The charges consisted primarily of team member severance and benefit costs. The Company does not expect these actions to have a material effect on its future results of operations.\n 30\nBusiness Divestitures\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Grainger divested E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. (E&R) and recorded a one-time pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $26 million in SG&A. The Company does not expect this business exit to have a material effect on its future results of operations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of reported net sales growth from the prior year period in accordance with GAAP to the Company's non-GAAP measures daily net sales and daily, organic constant currency net sales \nfor the twelve months end\ned \nDecember 31, 2024\n (in millions of dollars):\nFor the Years Ended December 31, \nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\nEndless Assortment\nTotal Company\n(1)\n2024\n% Change\n(2)\n2024\n% Change\n(2)\n2024\n% Change\n(2)\nReported net sales\n$\n13,720 \n3.4 \n%\n$\n3,134 \n7.5 \n%\n$\n17,168 \n4.2 \n%\n   Daily impact\n(3)\n \n(0.4)\n(0.8)\n(0.1)\n(0.9)\n(0.5)\n(0.8)\nDaily net sales\n53.2 \n2.6 \n12.1 \n6.6 \n66.5 \n3.4 \n   Foreign currency exchange\n(4)\n0.1 \n0.1 \n0.6 \n5.0 \n0.6 \n0.9 \n   Business divestiture\n(5)\n \n0.3 \n0.5 \n— \n— \n0.3 \n0.4 \nDaily, organic constant currency net sales\n$\n53.6 \n3.2 \n%\n$\n12.7 \n11.6 \n%\n$\n67.4 \n4.7 \n%\n2023\n% Change\n(2)\n2023\n% Change\n(2)\n2023\n% Change\n(2)\nReported net sales\n$\n13,267 \n8.9 \n%\n$\n2,916 \n4.7 \n%\n$\n16,478 \n8.2 \n%\n   Daily impact\n(3)\n \n0.2 \n0.4 \n— \n0.4 \n0.3 \n0.4 \nDaily net sales\n52.4 \n9.3 \n11.5 \n5.1 \n65.2 \n8.6 \n   Foreign currency exchange\n(4)\n— \n— \n0.6 \n5.3 \n0.6 \n0.9 \n   Business divestiture\n(5)\n \n— \n0.1 \n— \n— \n— \n— \nDaily, organic constant currency net sales\n$\n52.4 \n9.4 \n%\n$\n12.1 \n10.4 \n%\n65.8 \n9.5 \n%\n(1) \nTotal Company includes Other.

Grainger's reported and adjusted effective tax rates were 23.9% and 23.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \n 32\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGrainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. Grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.\nSources of Liquidity\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $1,036 million and $660 million, respectively. The increase in cash was primarily due to cash flows from operations and issuance of new long-term debt, partially offset by continued capital expenditure spend and higher volume of share repurchases. The Company had approximately $2.3 billion in available liquidity as of December 31, 2024.\nCash Flows\n \nThe following table shows the Company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n2,111 \n$\n2,031 \nInvesting activities\n(520)\n(422)\nFinancing activities\n(1,180)\n(1,278)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(35)\n4 \nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n376 \n$\n335 \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2,111 million and $2,031 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by continued growth in net earnings.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $520 million and $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase reflects the continued investment in U.S. supply chain capacity expansion throughout 2024.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,180 million and $1,278 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was due to the issuance of long-term debt, which includes $500 million in unsecured senior notes partially offset by higher treasury stock repurchases in 2024.\nDebt\nGrainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. Grainger has various sources of financing available. For further information regarding the Company's debt instruments and available financing sources, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization was 42.9% and 40.1%, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCredit Ratings\nGrainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Both credit rating agencies currently rate the Company's corporate credit at investment grade. \n 33\nThe following table summarizes the Company's credit ratings as of December 31, 2024:\nCorporate\nSenior Unsecured\nShort-term\nMoody's\nA2\nA2\nP1\nS&P\nA+\nA+\nA1\nUses of Liquidity\nInternally generated cash flows are the primary source of Grainger's working capital and growth initiatives, including capital expenditures. The \nCompany expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders through share \nrepurchases and dividends.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital as of December 31, 2024 was $3,282 million, an increase of $204 million compared to $3,078 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to sustained sales growth. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.9 and 2.8, respectively. \nCapital Expenditures\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company's capital expenditures were $541 million and $445 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital project spending for 2025 is expected to be in the range of $450 and $550 million. This includes continued supply chain capacity expansion and technology enhancements across the Company.\nShare Repurchases\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Grainger repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market for $1,201 million and $850 million, respectively. Share repurchases are executed at prices the Company determines appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and the Company's financial performance and may be affected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Share repurchases for 2025 are expected to be in the range of $1,150 and $1,250 million.\nDividends\nFor the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, \nGrainger declared and\n paid $421 million and $392 m\nillion, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company's common stock. \nCommitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nThe Company's material cash requirements include the following commitments and other contractual obligations. \nDebt \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding debt obligations with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $2,803 million, with $502 million pa\nya\nble within 12 months. Total future interest payments associated with the Company's outstanding debt obligations was $1,855 million, with $101 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Obligations\nGrainger had purchase o\nbligations of approximately $1,687 million as of December 31, 2024, which includes approximately $1,021 million payable within 12 months. Grainge\nr's purchase obligations primarily include commitments to purchase inventory, uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment and other goods and services. Purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs and are primarily noncancelable.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for\n certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, DCs and office space). As of December 31, 2024, the Company had fixed operating lease payment obligations of $437 million, with $91 million payable within 1\n2 months.\n 34\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of Grainger’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. The Company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on Grainger’s consolidated financial position and results. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the Company’s management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nInventories\nCompany inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The majority of the Company’s inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Market value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. The Company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. If business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. \nGoodwill\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. \nThe estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit. For further information on the Company's goodwill, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nContingencies and Legal Matters\nThe Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. For further information on the Company's contingencies and legal matters, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\n 35",
