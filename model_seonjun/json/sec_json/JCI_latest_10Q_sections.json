A detailed discussion of risks related to Johnson Controls' business is included in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Johnson Controls' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on November 19, 2024, which is available at www.sec.gov and www.johnsoncontrols.com under the \"Investors\" tab. The description of certain of these risks is supplemented in Item 1A of Part II of Johnson Controls subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this document are made only as of the date of this document, unless otherwise specified, and, except as required by law, Johnson Controls assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this document.\nOverview\nJohnson Controls International plc, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, is a global leader in smart, safe, healthy and sustainable buildings, serving a wide range of customers around the globe. The Company’s products and solutions advance the safety, comfort and intelligence of spaces to serve people, places and the planet. The Company is committed to helping its customers win and creating greater value for all of its stakeholders through its strategic focus on buildings.\n 35\nThe Company is a global leader in engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and retrofitting building products and systems, including commercial heating, ventilating, air-conditioning (\"HVAC\") equipment, industrial refrigeration systems, controls, security systems, fire-detection systems and fire-suppression solutions. The Company further serves customers by providing technical services, including maintenance, management, repair, retrofit and replacement of equipment (in the HVAC, industrial refrigeration, controls, security and fire-protection space) and energy-management consulting. The Company partners with customers by leveraging its broad product portfolio and digital capabilities, together with its direct channel service and solutions capabilities, to deliver outcome-based solutions across the lifecycle of a building that address customers’ needs to improve energy efficiency, enhance security, create healthy environments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nOn April 1, 2025, the Company, as part of ongoing initiatives to drive simplification, accelerate growth, better reflect its organizational and operational structure and align with the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions regarding the allocation of resources following portfolio simplification actions, realigned into three reportable segments (Americas, EMEA and APAC) from four reportable segments (Global Products, Building Solutions North America, Building Solutions EMEA/LA and Building Solutions APAC). The Company began reporting under this segment structure on April 1, 2025. \n \nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the September 30, 2024 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, along with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on November 19, 2024. References in the following discussion and analysis to \"Three Months,\" \"Third Quarter\" or similar language refer to the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, while \"Year-to-Date\" refers to nine months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nMuch of the demand for the Company’s products and solutions is heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for real estate and the availability of credit, public funding or other financing sources. Positive or negative fluctuations in these dependencies could have a corresponding impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nThe Company maintains global operations. The United States has announced tariffs and reciprocal tariffs on a wide range of products manufactured or produced worldwide, including Canada, China, the European Union, Japan and Mexico, among others. Several countries have similarly announced reciprocal or other tariffs impacting products manufactured or produced in the United States. In addition, the United States and other nations have, and may in the future, pause, reimpose, decrease or increase tariffs. Although the Company has been largely able to mitigate the impact of tariffs that have been enacted to date, if additional tariffs and reciprocal tariffs are implemented (whether as currently proposed or otherwise), such actions could negatively impact the Company's revenue growth and margins in future periods through decreased sales and increased cost of goods sold. Further, the Company has experienced, and could again experience, increased material cost inflation and component shortages, as well as disruptions and delays in its supply chain, as a result of global macroeconomic trends including the imposition of tariffs and other restrictive trade measures, as well as geopolitical and economic tensions. The net effect of these events will continue to depend on the Company’s ability to successfully mitigate and offset their impact. \nThe Company is taking actions to mitigate the actual and anticipated impact of these events, including strengthening the Company's in region, for region manufacturing strategy, pivoting to local sourcing in its supply chain, accelerating pricing actions and asserting contractual rights through change orders. The Company has historically taken a variety of actions to mitigate trade restrictions, supply chain disruptions and inflation, including through expanding and redistributing its supplier network, supplier financing, accelerated purchasing and productivity improvements. These actions have largely been successful mitigating the impacts of the current macroeconomic environment, however, it is uncertain as to whether the actions taken or contemplated to be taken by the Company will be effective in continuing to mitigate the impact of current and future trade restrictions and their related impacts. The Company continues to actively monitor and evaluate the development and potential impacts of tariffs and other trade restrictions on its supply chain and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Company’s global presence, a significant portion of its revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which results in non-U.S. currency risks and exchange exposure. While the Company employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate it completely from those exposures. In addition, currency exposure from the translation of non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries \n 36\ncannot be hedged. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce the Company’s profit margin, respectively, and impact the comparability of results from period to period\n.\nThe Company continues to observe trends demonstrating increased interest and demand for its products and services that enable smart, safe, efficient and sustainable buildings, which are driven in part by government tax incentives, building performance standards and other regulations designed to limit emissions and combat climate change. In particular, legislative and regulatory initiatives such as the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive include provisions designed to fund and encourage investment in decarbonization and digital technologies for buildings. This demand is supplemented by an increase in commitments in both the public and private sectors to reduce emissions and/or achieve net zero emissions. The Company seeks to capitalize on these trends to enable delivery of sustainable, high-efficiency products and tailored services to enable customers to achieve their sustainability goals. The Company is leveraging its install base, together with data-driven products and services, to offer outcome-based solutions to customers with a focus on generating accelerated growth in services and recurring revenue.\nCertain of our customers, including governmental and institutional customers, have exhibited increased uncertainty regarding future spending decisions due to various political and economic factors, including budget reductions, reprioritization of spending, interest rate fluctuation and economic uncertainty. This uncertainty has and may in the future impact the Company's ability to predict and forecast the revenue and backlog associated with these customers.\nThe extent to which the Company’s results of operations and financial condition are impacted by these and other factors in the future will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. See the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Johnson Controls' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on November 19, 2024. Certain of these risk factors have been updated and supplemented in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, filed on February 5, 2025 and May 7, 2025, respectively.\nPortfolio Simplification Transactions\nThe Company continues to engage in an ongoing evaluation of its non-core product lines in connection with its objective to be a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. On July 31, 2025, the Company completed the divestiture of its Residential and Light Commercial (\"R&LC\") HVAC business to Robert Bosch GmbH (“Bosch”) for net cash proceeds of approximately $5.0 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses. The R&LC HVAC business included the Company's North America Ducted business and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning Holding (UK) Ltd., the Company’s global residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc.\nRestructuring and Cost Optimization Initiatives \nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company committed to a multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded costs and further right-size its global operations as a result of previously announced portfolio simplification actions. It is expected that one-time restructuring costs, including severance and other employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, and certain other related cash and non-cash charges, of approximately $400 million will be incurred over the course of fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027, resulting in expected annual cost savings of approximately $500 million upon full completion of the plan. Restructuring and transformation costs in fiscal 2025 have been material, with the resulting savings being realized in fiscal 2026 and 2027. Restructuring costs will be incurred across all segments and Corporate functions.  \nCybersecurity Incident\nDuring the weekend of September 23, 2023, the Company experienced a cybersecurity incident impacting its internal information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure and applications. \nThe Company determined that certain data, primarily employee, job applicant and personal information and other related data, was impacted by the incident.\n \nThe Company has taken appropriate actions to notify individuals and regulatory authorities.\nBased on the information reviewed to date, the Company has not observed evidence of any impact to its digital products, services and solutions, including OpenBlue and Metasys.\n 37\nNet Sales\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nNine Months Ended June 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n6,052 \n$\n5,898 \n3 \n%\n$\n17,154 \n$\n16,704 \n3 \n%\nThe increase in net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2025 was due to higher organic sales ($343 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($55 million), partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures ($244 million).\n \nExcluding the impact of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, net sales increased 6% over the prior year, driven by growth in Services across all segments as well as growth in Products and Systems, led by the Americas.\nThe increase in net sales for the nine months ended June 30, 2025 was due to higher organic sales ($1,205 million), partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures ($708 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($47 million).

Backlog is applicable to sales of products and systems and services and totaled $16.2 billion at June 30, 2025. Orders provide management with a signal of customer demand for the Company's products and services, as well as an indication of future revenues and performance. However, the timing and conversion of backlog and orders are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks and are not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year. \nThe following table summarizes backlog and orders by segment for the Systems and Services based businesses\n: \n \nBacklog\nOrders\n(in billions)\nJune 30, 2025\nYear-over-Year Change \n(1)\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2025\nYear-over-Year Change \n(1)\nAmericas\n$\n10.3 \n10\n%\n$\n3.4 \n5\n%\nEMEA\n2.6 \n9\n%\n1.1 \n2\n%\nAPAC\n1.7 \n14\n%\n0.7 \n(8\n%)\n Total\n$\n14.6 \n11\n%\n$\n5.2 \n2\n%\n(1)\n \nChange is compared to June 30, 2024 (backlog) and the three months ended June 30, 2024 (orders) and excludes the impact of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency.\nRemaining performance obligations were $22.4 billion at June 30, 2025. Differences between the Company’s remaining performance obligations and backlog are primarily due to:\n•\nRemaining performance obligations include large, multi-purpose contracts to construct hospitals, schools and other governmental buildings, which are services to be performed over the building's lifetime with average initial contract terms of 25 to 35 years for the entire term of the contract versus backlog which includes only the lifecycle period of these contracts which approximates five years;\n•\nRemaining performance obligations exclude service contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts that are cancellable without substantial penalty versus backlog which includes short-term and cancellable contracts; and\n•\nRemaining performance obligations include the full remaining term of service contracts with substantial termination penalties versus backlog which includes only one year for all outstanding service contracts. \n 41\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\n(in millions)\nJune 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\nCurrent assets\n$\n11,849 \n$\n11,179 \nCurrent liabilities\n12,350 \n11,955 \nWorking capital\n$\n(501)\n$\n(776)\n(35)\n%\nAccounts receivable - net\n$\n6,151 \n$\n6,051 \n2 \n%\nInventories\n1,829 \n1,774 \n3 \n%\nAccounts payable\n3,421 \n3,389 \n1 \n%\n•\nThe increase in working capital at June 30, 2025 as compared to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to\n \na decrease in other current liabilities due to a payment related to the AFFF settlement agreement and an increase in current assets held for sale primarily due to seasonal increases in inventory and increases in accounts receivable related to the R&LC HVAC business, partially offset by higher short-term debt, an increase in deferred revenue and the net impact of various other current assets and liabilities.\nCash Flows From Continuing Operations\n \nNine Months Ended June 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,586 \n$\n216 \nCash used by investing activities\n(302)\n(286)\nCash used by financing activities\n(1,111)\n(190)\n•\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities reflects higher net income and decreases in accounts receivable and other assets, partially offset by the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities payments.\n•\nThe increase in cash used by investing activities was due to various investment transactions. \n•\nThe increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to changes in net debt activity.\nCapitalization\n(in millions)\nJune 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nShort-term debt\n$\n1,277 \n$\n953 \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n570 \n536 \nLong-term debt\n8,446 \n8,004 \nTotal debt\n10,293 \n9,493 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n731 \n606 \nNet debt\n$\n9,562 \n$\n8,887 \nShareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls\n   ordinary shareholders (\"Equity\")\n$\n15,830 \n$\n16,098 \nTotal capitalization (Total debt plus Equity)\n26,123 \n25,591 \nNet capitalization (Net debt plus Equity)\n25,392 \n24,985 \nTotal debt as a % of Total capitalization\n39.4 \n%\n37.1 \n%\nNet debt as a % of Net capitalization\n37.7 \n%\n35.6 \n%\n 42\n•\nNet debt and net debt as a percentage of net capitalization are non-GAAP financial measures.

As of June 30, 2025, approximately $9.8 billion remains available under the Company's share repurchase authorization, which does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time depending on market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, and the economic environment.\n•\nThe Company declared a dividend of $0.37 per common share in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 and intends to continue paying dividends throughout fiscal 2025.\n•\nThe Company received net cash proceeds related to the sale of its R&LC HVAC business of approximately $5.0 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses in connection with the close of the transaction on July 31, 2025. Consistent with its capital allocation policy, the Company expects to return a portion of the net proceeds of the transaction to shareholders through the implementation of a $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase program expected to commence in the coming weeks pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase authorization.\n•\nThe Company believes its capital resources and liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents of $0.7 billion at June 30, 2025, are adequate to fund operations and meet its cash obligations for the foreseeable future. \n–\nThe Company manages its short-term debt position in the U.S. and euro commercial paper and bank loan markets. Commercial paper outstanding totaled $650 million as of June 30, 2025 and $350 million as of September 30, 2024.\n–\nThe Company maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which it may issue additional debt securities, ordinary shares, preferred shares, depository shares, warrants, purchase contracts and units that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. The Company anticipates that the proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchases of ordinary shares, dividends, capital expenditures and investments in the Company's subsidiaries. \n–\nThe Company also has the ability to draw on its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in December 2028 or its $0.5 billion revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in December 2025. There were no draws on the revolving credit facilities as of June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024.  \n•\nThe Company's ability to access the global capital markets and the related cost of financing is dependent upon, among other factors, the Company's credit ratings. As of June 30, 2025, the Company's credit ratings and outlook were as follows:\nRating Agency\nShort-Term Rating\nLong-Term Rating\nOutlook\nS&P\nA-2\nBBB+\nStable\nMoody's\nP-2\nBaa1\nStable\nThe security ratings set forth above are issued by unaffiliated third party rating agencies and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization at any time.\n•\nFinancial covenants in the Company's revolving credit facilities require a minimum consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls of at least $3.5 billion at all times. The revolving credit facility also limits the amount of debt secured by liens that may be incurred to a maximum aggregated amount of 10% of consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls for liens and pledges. For purposes of calculating these covenants, consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls is calculated without giving effect to (i) the application of Accounting \n 43\nStandards Codification (\"ASC\") 715-60, \"Defined Benefit Plans - Other Postretirement,\" or (ii) the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. As of June 30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its credit agreements and the indentures governing its notes, and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. None of the Company’s debt agreements limit access to stated borrowing levels or require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in the Company's credit rating.\n•\nThe Company earns a significant amount of its income outside of the parent company. Outside basis differences in these subsidiaries are deemed to be permanently reinvested except in limited circumstances. However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense related to a change in the Company's assertion over the outside basis differences of the Company’s investment in certain consolidated subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestiture of its R&LC HVAC business. The Company currently does not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate undistributed earnings included in the outside basis differences other than in tax efficient manners. The Company's intent is to reduce basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. The Company expects existing U.S. cash and liquidity to continue to be sufficient to fund the Company’s U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., should the Company require more capital than is generated by its operations, the Company could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. The Company has borrowed funds in the U.S. and continues to have the ability to borrow funds in the U.S. at reasonable interest rates. In addition, the Company expects existing non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund the Company’s non-U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should the Company require more capital at its Luxembourg and Ireland holding and financing entities, other than amounts that can be provided in tax efficient methods, the Company could also elect to raise capital through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of the Company’s earnings.\n•\nThe Company may from time to time purchase its outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Purchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. \n•\nRefer to Note 8, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on debt balances and items impacting capitalization.\nCo-Issued Securities: Summarized Financial Information\nThe following information is provided in compliance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the following unsecured, unsubordinated senior notes (collectively, (\"the Notes) which were issued by Johnson Controls International plc (\"Parent Company\") and Tyco Fire & Security Finance S.C.A.
