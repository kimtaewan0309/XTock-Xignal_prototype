The SEC maintains a website (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy, and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. \nNarrative Description of Business\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned interests in, operated, or were developing 177 multifamily properties comprised of 59,996 apartment homes across the United States. Of the 177 properties, three properties were under construction and will consist of a total of 1,138 apartment homes when completed. We also own land holdings which we may develop into communities in the future.\nOperating and Business Strategy\nWe believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations, development and acquisitions, achieving market balance, and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success. We rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to maximize the earnings potential of our communities.\nReal Estate Investments and Market Balance.\n We believe we are well-positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise. These capabilities, combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure, should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents.\nWe continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale. We believe, where possible, it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market. However, consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth, we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons, including if we determine a property cannot meet our long-term earnings growth expectations.\nWe try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation. These markets generally feature the following:\n•\nstrong economic growth leading to household formation and job growth, which in turn should support higher demand for our apartments; and\n•\nan attractive quality of life, which may lead to higher demand and retention for our apartments and allow us to more readily grow revenue.\nSubject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire operating communities, develop new communities, and to redevelop and reposition existing communities. We also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. \nWe expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and \n1\nTable of Contents\nleverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. We intend to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our at-the-market (\"ATM\") share offering programs, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages. \nSophisticated Property Management\n. We believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services, promote resident satisfaction, and retain residents, thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses. We manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel, including certified property managers, experienced apartment managers and leasing staff, and trained apartment maintenance technicians. Our on-site personnel are trained to deliver high-quality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our on-site employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results.\nOperations.\n We believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent, sustained earnings growth. Ensuring customer satisfaction, increasing rents as market conditions allow, maximizing rent collections (subject to restrictions of applicable law), maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels, and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results. Lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type such that lease expirations are matched to each property's seasonal rental patterns. Our average lease terms are approximately fourteen months, and our individual property marketing plans are structured to respond to local market conditions. In addition, we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely responses to customers' changing needs and a high-level of satisfaction.\nCompetition\nThere are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents. Our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums, single-family homes, and third-party providers of short-term rentals, which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located. This competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes or on the rents realized at our present properties or any newly-developed or acquired property.\nHuman Capital Management\nPurpose and Culture.\n We strive to differentiate ourselves by our culture and talent. How we manage our human capital is critical to how we deliver on our strategy and create sustained growth and value for our shareholders. We strive to improve the lives of our team members, customers, and shareholders one experience at a time. We recognize a great culture is foundational to the success of this vision. Key components in managing our human capital are listed below.\nCamden's Values. \nWe care deeply about our team members, our residents, and the local communities in which we live, work, and play. We are committed to maintaining a high-trust work environment which attracts, retains, and rewards the best and brightest people. We believe our workplace reflects Camden’s nine core values: Customer Focused; People Driven; Team Players; Lead by Example; Results Oriented; Work Smart; Always Do the Right Thing; Act with Integrity; and Have Fun. We believe these values cultivate an environment of respect, fairness, diversity, and fun for all.\nA Great Place to Work.\n In addition to our core values, we are committed to creating a great working environment that fosters all team members' well-being, health, and happiness. We believe our team members are given meaningful opportunities to provide feedback and effect change. We are proud of our culture and the recognition we have received as a great place to work, including being recognized nationally as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For® by FORTUNE magazine for 17 consecutive years, most recently ranking #24. \nCompensation and Benefits.\n We provide high-quality health benefits and compensation to competitively compensate all team members for their contributions to Camden. We have formal programs intended to positively impact team members such as healthcare, rent discounts, education allowances, and scholarships for children of our employees.\nTraining and Development. \nOur mission, vision, and values are also incorporated into our employee training and development programs.\n \nOne of our most cherished mantras is \"Never Stop Learning.\" We encourage team members to discover their individual strengths and cultivate new interests. We offer tuition assistance to team members working to earn industry designations from various organizations. We also support team members who want to continue their education at an accredited educational institution through our Education Assistance Program. In addition to these programs, we also help employees improve their personal and professional lives through training, coaching, and mentoring. CamdenU, our in-house learning center, is available to all employees and offers courses in subjects related to leadership, management, and operations. In addition to formal training, Camden’s mentoring program supports its newest employees by pairing them with experienced employees to facilitate their on-boarding process and immerse them in Camden’s culture.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had approximately 1,660 employees including executive, community, and administrative personnel. Camden embraces all team members as full and valued members of the organization. \n2\nTable of Contents\nQualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust\nAs of December 31, 2024, we met the qualification of a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). As a result, with the exception of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, we will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the Code.",

Overall, we focus on investing in markets characterized by high-growth economic conditions, strong employment, and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments. As of December 31, 2024, we owned interests in, operated, or were developing 177 multifamily properties comprised of 59,996 apartment homes across the United States as detailed in the Property Portfolio table below. In addition, we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future.\nBusiness Environment and Current Outlook\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflect an increase in same store revenues of approximately 1.3% as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due to higher rental income as a result of higher average rental rates and lower uncollectible revenue, which we believe was primarily attributable to job growth, favorable demographics with a higher propensity to rent versus buy, and continued demand for multifamily housing in our markets.\nWe believe the levels of new multifamily supply in the submarkets and asset classes in which we operate will continue to be elevated into 2025 but should be met with continued demand to absorb these new deliveries. However, if this were to change or other economic conditions were to worsen, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nConsolidated Results\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $163.3 million and $403.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to recognizing a higher gain on sale of two operating properties in 2023 of $225.4 million as compared to recognizing a gain on sale of one operating property in 2024 of $43.8 million. The decrease was also due to recognizing a $41.0 million impairment associated with land development activities in 2024 and no impairments recognized in 2023. See further discussion of our 2024 operations as compared to 2023 in \n\"Results of Operations,\"\n below. \nConstruction and Development Activity\nAt December 31, 2024, we had a total of three projects under construction to be comprised of 1,138 apartment homes. Initial occupancies of these three projects are currently scheduled to occur within the next two years. As of December 31, 2024, we estimated the total additional cost to complete the construction of these three properties is approximately $243.6 million.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we stopped development activities for the foreseeable future on four of our developments and recorded approximately $41.0 million of impairment charges on three of these land parcels. We review our long-lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicated the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and our impairment evaluations take into consideration the current and anticipated economic climate. We currently have three other land parcels held for future development we plan to develop, and the commencement of future developments may be impacted by macroeconomic issues, multifamily market conditions, and other factors. We will continue to evaluate future development starts based on market, economic, and capital market conditions. There can be no assurance we will not have impairments charges in the future.\nDisposition\nIn February 2024, we sold one operating property comprised of 592 apartment homes located in Atlanta, Georgia, for approximately $115.0 million and recognized a gain of approximately $43.8 million. \nCapital Market Highlights \nIn January 2024, we issued $400.0 million of 4.90% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2034. We utilized a portion of the net proceeds from these notes to repay the outstanding balance on our $300.0 million, 6.21% unsecured term loan due in August 2024. As a result of this early repayment of the $300.0 million unsecured term loan, we expensed approximately $0.9 million of unamortized loan costs, which are reflected in the loss on early retirement of debt in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.  \nIn September 2024, we extended the maturity date of our $40.0 million unsecured floating rate term loan with an unrelated third party from September 2024 to September 2026. \n18\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we utilized cash on hand and our unsecured revolving credit facility to repay unsecured notes payable totaling $500.0 million, plus accrued interest. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 515,974 common shares for approximately $50.0 million at an average price of $96.88 per share under our $500.0 million share repurchase plan. As of the date of this filing, the remaining dollar value of our common equity securities authorized to be repurchased under this plan was approximately $450.0 million. \nSubsequent Events\nIn January 2025, we purchased one operating property comprised of 352 homes located in the Austin, Texas metropolitan area for approximately $67.7 million.\nFuture Outlook\nSubject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire operating communities, develop new communities, and to redevelop and reposition existing communities. We also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolios and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. We intend to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our ATM programs, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.0 billion available under our $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and do not have any debt maturing until April 2026. As of December 31, 2024, and through the date of this filing, we also had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $500.0 million remaining available for sale under our 2023 ATM program. We believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development, redevelopment, and other capital funding requirements. We will, however, continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements. \nProperty Portfolio\nOur multifamily property portfolio is summarized as follows:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nNumber of\nHomes\nProperties\nNumber of\nHomes\nProperties\nOperating Properties\nHouston, Texas \n9,531 \n28 \n9,154 \n26 \nDallas/Fort Worth, Texas\n6,224 \n15 \n6,224 \n15 \nWashington, D.C.

NOI is defined as total property income less total property operating expenses. NOI is further detailed in the Property-Level NOI table as seen below. NOI is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance, should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs. Additionally, NOI as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation.\nReconciliations of net income to NOI for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$170,840\n$410,553\nLess: Fee and asset management income\n(7,137)\n(3,451)\nLess: Interest and other income\n(4,420)\n(879)\nLess: Income on deferred compensation plans\n(12,629)\n(15,398)\nPlus: Property management expense\n38,331 \n33,706 \nPlus: Fee and asset management expense\n2,200 \n1,717 \nPlus: General and administrative expense\n72,365 \n62,506 \nPlus: Interest expense\n129,815 \n133,395 \nPlus: Depreciation and amortization expense\n582,014 \n574,813 \nPlus: Expense on deferred compensation plans\n12,629 \n15,398 \nPlus: Impairment associated with land development activities \n40,988 \n— \nPlus: Loss on early retirement of debt\n921 \n2,513 \nLess: Gain on sale of operating properties\n(43,806)\n(225,416)\nPlus: Income tax expense\n2,926 \n3,650 \nNet operating income\n$\n985,037 \n$\n993,107 \n \n22\nTable of Contents\nProperty-Level NOI\n (1)\nProperty NOI, as reconciled above, is detailed further into the categories below for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023:\n \n \nNumber of\nHomes at\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n($ in thousands)\n12/31/2024\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nProperty revenues:\nSame store communities\n55,866 \n$\n1,463,982 \n$\n1,444,649 \n$\n19,333 \n1.3 \n%\nNon-same store communities\n2,195 \n57,001 \n49,060 \n7,941 \n16.2 \nDevelopment and lease-up communities\n1,935 \n8,289 \n158 \n8,131 \n*\nDispositions/other\n— \n14,570 \n48,160 \n(33,590)\n(69.7)\nTotal property revenues\n59,996 \n$\n1,543,842 \n$\n1,542,027 \n$\n1,815 \n0.1 \n%\nProperty expenses:\nSame store communities\n55,866 \n$\n520,848 \n$\n511,459 \n$\n9,389 \n1.8 \n%\nNon-same store communities\n2,195 \n20,277 \n19,122 \n1,155 \n6.0 \nDevelopment and lease-up communities\n1,935 \n4,290 \n172 \n4,118 \n*\nDispositions/other\n— \n13,390 \n18,167 \n(4,777)\n(26.3)\nTotal property expenses\n59,996 \n$\n558,805 \n$\n548,920 \n$\n9,885 \n1.8 \n%\nProperty NOI:\nSame store communities\n55,866 \n$\n943,134 \n$\n933,190 \n$\n9,944 \n1.1 \n%\nNon-same store communities\n2,195 \n36,724 \n29,938 \n6,786 \n22.7 \nDevelopment and lease-up communities\n1,935 \n3,999 \n(14)\n4,013 \n*\nDispositions/other\n— \n1,180 \n29,993 \n(28,813)\n(96.1)\nTotal property NOI\n59,996 \n$\n985,037 \n$\n993,107 \n$\n(8,070)\n(0.8)\n%\n* Not a meaningful percentage.\n(1)    \nFor 2024, same store communities are communities we owned and were stabilized since January 1, 2023, excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale. Non-same store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since January 1, 2023, including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale. We define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures that improve a community's cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit, exterior building, common area, and amenity upgrades. Management believes same store information is useful as it allows both management and investors to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities. Development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we have developed since January 1, 2023, excluding properties held for sale. Dispositions/other includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations, non-multifamily rental properties, expenses related to land holdings not under active development, and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses, including net below market leases, casualty-related expenses net of recoveries, and severance related costs.\nSame Store Analysis\nSame store property NOI increased approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due to an increase of approximately $19.3 million in same store property revenues, partially offset by an increase of approximately $9.4 million in same store property expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe $19.3 million increase in same store property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher rental revenue due to higher average rental rates of approximately $9.0 million, lower uncollectible revenue of approximately $6.5 million, and higher other rental income of approximately $1.6 million. The increase was also due to approximately $2.1 million of higher income from our utility and ancillary income programs. \nThe $9.4 million increase in same store property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits of approximately $5.7 million, higher utilities expense and expenses associated with our ancillary programs of approximately $4.8 million, higher marketing, leasing, and other expenses of approximately $2.4 million, higher repairs and maintenance expense of approximately $2.3 million, and higher property general and administrative expenses of approximately $0.9 million. The increase was partially offset by lower property insurance expense of approximately $6.4 million and lower real estate taxes of approximately $0.3 million. \n23\nTable of Contents\nNon-same Store and Development and Lease-up Analysis\nProperty NOI from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase from non-same store communities of approximately $6.8 million and an increase from development and lease-up communities of approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in property NOI from our non-same store communities was primarily due to the stabilization of two operating properties in 2023 and one operating property in 2024. The increase in property NOI from our development and lease-up communities was primarily due to the timing of three development communities under lease-up, one of which completed construction during the second quarter of 2024 and two of which completed construction during the fourth quarter of 2024. \nThe following table details the changes, described above, relating to non-same store and development and lease-up NOI:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024 compared to 2023\nProperty Revenues:\nRevenues from non-same store stabilized properties\n$\n7.5 \nRevenues from development and lease-up properties\n8.1 \nOther non same-store\n0.5 \n$\n16.1 \nProperty Expenses:\nExpenses from non-same store stabilized properties\n$\n1.2 \nExpenses from development and lease-up properties\n4.1 \nOther non same-store\n— \n$\n5.3 \nProperty NOI:\nNOI from non-same store stabilized properties\n$\n6.3 \nNOI from development and lease-up properties\n4.0 \nOther non same-store\n0.5 \n$\n10.8 \nDispositions/Other Property Analysis\nDispositions/other property NOI decreased approximately $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was comprised of lower NOI related to dispositions of approximately $24.3 million due to the dispositions of one operating property in each of June 2023, December 2023, and February 2024. The decrease was also due to lower other property NOI of approximately $4.5 million primarily due to higher storm-related insurance expenses of approximately $5.6 million, partially offset by approximately $1.1 million of higher revenues related to business interruption proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.  \nNon-Property Income\n \n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n($ in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nFee and asset management\n$\n7,137 \n$\n3,451 \n$\n3,686 \n106.8 \n%\nInterest and other income\n4,420 \n879 \n3,541 \n*\nIncome on deferred compensation plans\n12,629 \n15,398 \n(2,769)\n(18.0)\nTotal non-property income\n$\n24,186 \n$\n19,728 \n$\n4,458 \n22.6 \n%\n*Not a meaningful percentage.\nFee and asset management income from construction and development activities at our third-party construction projects increased approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily related to higher fees earned on third-party construction projects due to higher activity during 2024 as compared to 2023.\nInterest and other income increased approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher investment interest income earned due to having higher average cash balances in 2024 as compared to 2023. \n24\nTable of Contents\nOur deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately $12.6 million and $15.4 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans, as discussed below. \nOther Expenses\n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n($ in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nProperty management\n$\n38,331 \n$\n33,706 \n$\n4,625 \n13.7 \n%\nFee and asset management\n2,200 \n1,717 \n483 \n28.1 \nGeneral and administrative\n72,365 \n62,506 \n9,859 \n15.8 \nInterest\n129,815 \n133,395 \n(3,580)\n(2.7)\nDepreciation and amortization\n582,014 \n574,813 \n7,201 \n1.3 \nExpense on deferred compensation plans\n12,629 \n15,398 \n(2,769)\n(18.0)\nTotal other expenses\n$\n837,354 \n$\n821,535 \n$\n15,819 \n1.9 \n%\nProperty management expenses, which primarily represent regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, increased approximately $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily related to higher salary, benefits, and incentive compensation costs, and higher advocacy contributions. Property management expenses were 2.5% and 2.2% of total property revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFee and asset management expense from construction and development activities at our third-party projects increased approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to the increase in third-party construction activity in 2024. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily related to higher salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation costs, higher legal expenses, and higher abandoned acquisition and development pursuit costs. Excluding income on deferred compensation plans, general and administrative expenses were 4.7% and 4.0% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nInterest expense decreased approximately $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the repayments of a $300 million, 6.21% unsecured term loan and $250.0 million, 4.36% senior unsecured notes in January 2024, and the repayment of a $250 million, 3.68% senior unsecured notes in September 2024, and lower interest expense recognized on our unsecured revolving credit facility resulting from lower average balances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was also due to the early retirement of $185.2 million of secured variable rate notes in May 2023 and the repayment of $250 million, 5.07% senior unsecured notes in June 2023. The decrease was partially offset by increases in interest expense due to the issuance of $500 million senior unsecured notes in November 2023, the issuance of $400 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024 and decreases in capitalized interest expense primarily due to having lower average balances in assets under construction during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. \nDepreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to the completion of apartment homes in our development pipeline and the completion of capitalized improvements during 2023 and 2024. The increase was partially offset by the disposition of one operating property in each of June 2023, December 2023, and February 2024.\nOur deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately $12.6 million and $15.4 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans, as discussed in the Non-Property Income section above. \n25\nTable of Contents\nOther\n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n$\nImpairment associated with land development activities\n$\n(40,988)\n$\n— \n$\n(40,988)\nLoss on early retirement of debt\n$\n(921)\n$\n(2,513)\n$\n1,592 \nGain on sale of operating properties\n$\n43,806 \n$\n225,416 \n$\n(181,610)\nIncome tax expense\n$\n(2,926)\n$\n(3,650)\n$\n724 \nThe impairment expense associated with land development activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 of approximately $41.0 million related to three projects we have put on hold. These impairment charges represent the difference between each parcel's estimated fair value and the carrying value, which included the original purchase price and other capitalized development costs.\nThe $0.9 million loss on early retirement of debt during the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to the write-off of unamortized loan costs related to the early retirement of our $300 million unsecured term loan in January 2024, which was scheduled to mature in August 2024. The $2.5 million loss on early retirement of debt during the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the early repayment of our $185.2 million secured variable rate notes due in 2024 and 2026, and consisted of approximately $1.7 million of prepayment penalties and fees and approximately $0.8 million of unamortized fair value adjustments.\nThe $43.8 million gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to the disposition of one operating property located in Atlanta, Georgia in February 2024. The $225.4 million gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the disposition of two operating properties located in Costa Mesa, California.\nIncome tax expense decreased approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower state income and franchise income taxes relating to recent tax legislation changes in certain state jurisdictions, offset by an increase in taxable income due to higher third-party construction activities within a taxable REIT subsidiary.  \nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Core FFO, and Core Adjusted FFO (\"Core AFFO\")\nManagement considers FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") currently defines FFO  as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Our calculation of diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains and losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets, and depreciation, FFO can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate investments between periods or to different companies.\nCore FFO represents FFO as further adjusted for items not considered part of our core business operations. We consider Core FFO to be a helpful supplemental measure of operating performance as it excludes not only depreciation expense of real estate assets, but it also excludes certain items which, by nature, are not comparable period over period and therefore tends to obscure actual operating performance. Our definition of Core FFO may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs.\nCore AFFO is calculated utilizing Core FFO less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. We also consider Core AFFO to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a REIT's operating performance between periods or to different companies. Our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs.\nTo facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we believe FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report. FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance. Additionally, FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation.\n26\nTable of Contents\nReconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n($ in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nFunds from operations\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n163,293 \n$\n403,309 \nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n569,998 \n562,654 \nImpairment associated with land development activities\n40,988 \n— \nGain on sale of operating properties\n(43,806)\n(225,331)\nIncome allocated to non-controlling interests\n7,547 \n7,244 \nFunds from operations\n$\n738,020 \n$\n747,876 \nCasualty-related expenses, net of recoveries\n5,849 \n1,186 \nSeverance\n506 \n— \nLegal costs and settlements\n4,844 \n280 \nLoss on early retirement of debt\n921 \n2,513 \nExpensed transaction, development, and other pursuit costs\n2,203 \n471 \nAdvocacy contributions\n1,653 \n— \nMiscellaneous (income)/expense\n (1)\n— \n(364)\nCore funds from operations\n$\n753,996 \n$\n751,962 \nLess: recurring capitalized expenditures\n(106,403)\n(97,094)\nCore adjusted funds from operations\n$\n647,593 \n$\n654,868 \nWeighted average shares – basic\n108,491 \n108,653 \nIncremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of:\nShare awards granted\n48 \n21 \nCommon units\n1,594 \n1,595 \nWeighted average shares – diluted\n110,133 \n110,269 \n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2023, activity relates to proceeds from an earn-out from a previously sold technology investment. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition and Sources of Liquidity\nWe intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. We intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:\n \n•\nextending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable;\n•\nmanaging interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;\n•\nmaintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios; and\n•\nusing what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity.\nOur interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was approximately 6.9 and 6.8 times for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses, non-property income, and other expenses after adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense. Approximately 89.9% and 89.8% of our properties were unencumbered at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 6.2 years at December 31, 2024.\nWe also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals, which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs.\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations. Other sources may include one or more of the following: availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our 2023 ATM program, and other \n27\nTable of Contents\nunsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. We believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs over the next 12 months including:\n•\nnormal recurring operating expenses;\n•\ncurrent debt service requirements, including scheduled debt maturities;\n•\nrecurring and non-recurring capital expenditures;\n•\nfunding of property developments, repositions, redevelopments, and acquisitions; and\n•\nthe minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code.\nFactors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets, changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws, sources of financing, the minimum REIT dividend requirements, our ability to complete asset purchases, sales, or developments, the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds, and our ability to access capital markets. \nCash Flows\nThe following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNet cash from operating activities was approximately $774.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to approximately $795.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash from property operations due to the sale of two operating properties in 2023 and one operating property in 2024, and higher real estate tax payments in 2024 as compared to 2023.  The decrease was partially offset by the growth attributable to our same store and non-same store communities. See further discussions of our 2024 operations as compared to 2023 in \n\"Results of Operations.\"\n \nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $285.2 million as compared to $127.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash outflows during 2024 primarily related to amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately $393.7 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of one operating property of approximately $114.5 million. Cash outflows during 2023 primarily related to the amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately $410.9 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of two operating properties of approximately $290.7 million. The decrease in property development and capital improvements for 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower property development expenditures in 2024 as compared to 2023. The property development and capital improvements during 2024 and 2023, included the following:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nExpenditures for new development, including land\n$\n163.2 \n$\n179.3 \nCapital expenditures\n112.2 \n107.1 \nReposition expenditures\n87.9 \n88.2 \nDirect real estate taxes and capitalized interest and other indirect costs\n30.4 \n36.3 \n     Total\n$\n393.7 \n$\n410.9 \nNet cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $725.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to approximately $417.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash outflows during 2024 primarily related to the repayment of our $250 million senior unsecured notes in September 2024 and the repayment of our $300 million unsecured term loan and the $250 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024. Cash outflows also related to $451.0 million used for distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, and $50.0 million used for common share repurchases. These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately $396.0 million from the issuance of $400.0 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024, and net proceeds of $178.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility. Cash outflows during 2023 primarily related to $434.9 million used for distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, the repayment of $250 million senior unsecured notes and $187.7 million secured variable rate notes, which includes prepayment penalties and fees, and the net repayment of $42.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility. These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately $498.2 million from the issuance of $500.0 million senior unsecured notes in November 2023.\nFinancial Flexibility\nWe have a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in August 2026, with two options to extend the facility at our election for two consecutive six-month periods and to expand the facility up to three times by up to an additional $500 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The interest rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility is based upon, \n28\nTable of Contents\nat our option, (a) the daily or the one-, three-, or six- months Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus, in each case, a spread based on our credit rating, or (b) a base rate equal to the higher of: (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America, N.A.'s price rate, (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.0%, and (iv) 1.0%. Advances under our unsecured revolving credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. These bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of $600 million or the remaining amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. We believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of December 31, 2024 and through the date of this filing.  \nOur unsecured revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $50 million in letters of credit. While our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $27.5 million, and approximately $1.0 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. \nIn May 2023, we created the 2023 ATM share offering program through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares and we may also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering amount of up to $500.0 million, in amounts and at times as we determine, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. Actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us. We intend to use the proceeds from any sale of our common shares under the 2023 ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the repayment of other indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities, funding for development activities, and financing for acquisitions. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into any forward sales agreements and have not sold any shares under the 2023 ATM program. \nWe currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer, from time to time, common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, or warrants. Our Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest, consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares. At December 31, 2024, we had approximately 106.7 million common shares outstanding, net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements, and no preferred shares outstanding.\nWe believe our ability to access the capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by Fitch, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's, which were A- with stable outlook, A3 with stable outlook, and A- with stable outlook, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. We believe our ability to access the capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or life insurance companies. However, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future.\nFuture Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nOne of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including any future borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. As of the date of this filing, we did not have any debt maturing until April 2026. See \nNote 8. \"Notes Payable,\"\n in the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our scheduled maturities.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the three projects to be approximately $243.6 million. Of this amount, we expect to incur costs between approximately $135 million and $155 million during 2025 and to incur the remaining costs during 2026 and 2027. Additionally, we expect to incur costs between approximately $100 million and $110 million related to the start of new development activities, between approximately $96 million and $100 million of repositions, redevelopment, repurposes, and revenue enhancing expenditures and between approximately $108 million and $112 million of additional recurring capital expenditures during 2025.\nWe anticipate meeting our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our ATM programs, other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. We continue to evaluate our portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise.\nAs a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our annual taxable income. In order to reduce the amount of income taxes, our general policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income. In December 2024, we announced our Board of Trust Managers had declared a quarterly dividend of $1.03 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of December 18, 2024. This dividend was subsequently paid on January 17, 2025, and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units. When aggregated with previous 2024 dividends, \n29\nTable of Contents\nthis distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of $4.12 per share or unit for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nIn the first quarter of 2025, the Company's Board of Trust Managers declared a first quarter dividend of $1.05 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of March 31, 2025. Future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the Board of Trust Managers and a number of factors are considered, including the Company's past performance and future prospects, which may be deemed relevant by our Board of Trust Managers. Assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2025, our annualized dividend rate for 2025 would be $4.20. \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. These estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see \nNote 2. \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements,\"\n to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Assets\n. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets. We consider projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends, strategic decisions regarding future development plans, and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding a number of factors, including market rents, economic conditions, and occupancies, could significantly affect these estimates. When impairment exists, the long-lived asset is adjusted to its fair value. In estimating fair value, management uses appraisals, comparable sales, management estimates, and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an impairment of approximately $41.0 million related to three parcels of land.  \nThe value of our properties under development depends on market conditions, including estimates of the project start date, projected construction costs, as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities. We have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses. Due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses, it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated.\nWe believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets, properties under development, and land is currently recoverable. However, if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates, we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets. Any such material non-cash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations and therefore could reduce net income.",
