These agents help clinicians assess patients to enable more precise diagnoses, monitor disease progression, and enable better therapy selection. We distribute products globally that help meet patient and procedural needs across a multitude of modalities. PDx’s diagnostic agents are complementary to the imaging and ultrasound devices we offer, including CT, angiography and X-ray, MR, single-photon emission computed tomography (“SPECT”) and PET, and are also compatible with systems from other equipment vendors.\nPDx operates within a strictly regulated industry with unique operational needs. Diagnostic agents require a sophisticated supply chain for manufacturing, supported by a global infrastructure of commercial, marketing, medical affairs, market access, application, regulatory, and pharmacovigilance teams that help monitor products. Customers require timely and reliable supply of diagnostic agents as shortages or delays can be highly disruptive to workflows and even cause exam cancellations.\nOur PDx business develops and produces two types of imaging agents: contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals.\n•\nContrast media are pharmaceuticals that are administered to a patient prior to certain diagnostic scans in order to increase the visibility of tissues or structures during imaging exams. Contrast media increases the diagnostic value of imaging and can be critical in the visualization of small or nuanced areas of diagnostic interest, such as cancer lesions or vascular structures, and to plan medical interventions, such as angioplasties, biopsies, or radiation therapy. We offer contrast media to three imaging modality groups: (1) CT, angiography, and X-ray, (2) MR, and (3) Ultrasound. Our business also includes contrast injection devices that are automated devices used to monitor and control the injection of contrast into patients, providing valuable productivity benefits in the imaging suite. We offer contrast injectors through collaborations with third-party original equipment manufacturers.\n•\nRadiopharmaceuticals, or molecular imaging agents, are molecular tracers labeled with radioisotopes that are injected into a patient prior to a diagnostic imaging scan. These agents work by accumulating in an area of diagnostic interest, such as a tumor, and emitting energy that is detected by a SPECT or PET scanner. Because they have specific molecular targets, they allow visualization and assessment of cell function, providing a more detailed dimension of biological activity. Our radiopharmaceuticals support diagnosis and therapy selection in various care areas, such as neurology, cardiology, and oncology, and are also used by pharmaceutical companies and researchers in selecting target populations for clinical trials.\nOur unique combination of imaging equipment and pharmaceutical diagnostics enables building capabilities across disease states through diagnostic pharmaceuticals, hardware, software, and AI and digital solutions. Our strong portfolio of diagnostic agents and advanced global supply chain, combined with our imaging, cyclotron, and advanced visualization software, positions us to grow in existing markets as well as emerging adjacencies.\nACQUISITIONS\nOur business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that expand or complement our existing business. Refer to Note 8, “Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets” for further information.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES\nOur research and development (“R&D”) efforts focus on scientific discovery and research into promising technologies that lead to potential healthcare applications, creating new products, services and solutions, discovery of novel clinical applications for on-market products and solutions, and enhancing our existing products to help improve outcomes for customers and their patients. We deliver value through innovative medical technology solutions across the patient care continuum (including screening, diagnosis, and therapy, monitoring) by leveraging hardware, software, AI, and digital technologies. We engage in and sponsor clinical research and product development through collaborations with universities, medical centers, and other organizations. We occasionally enter into agreements with third parties related to collaboration on R&D activities associated with the development of new or innovative products. \nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe have a substantial portfolio of intellectual property (“IP”). We rely on a combination of patent, design, utility model, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and regulatory exclusivity period protections, as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our IP. Our IP team collaborates with our R&D and product teams to develop product-line-focused IP strategies and secure IP rights as appropriate. We generally file patent applications in the United States and other countries that have strong technology patent protections. We also license from third parties a variety of IP that complements our internal R&D efforts and our product offerings. While, in aggregate, our patents and other IP are vital to our operations, we do not consider any single IP asset or group of assets to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole; rather, we believe understanding our customers’ needs, technology expertise, and manufacturing know-how are critical for our business.\n7\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements with colleagues, contractors, consultants, and third parties to help protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology, and other confidential information. We also monitor development and commercialization activities of third parties so our IP rights are not infringed upon. In addition, we make infrastructure investments to secure our IP assets and conduct audits to assess the effectiveness of our IP protection program.\nWe believe that invention leads to value for our customers and stakeholders, and that a culture of innovation across GE HealthCare is a core element of our success.\nAs part of the Spin-Off from GE, we secured IP specific to our business and GE granted us a license to use other IP required for our business. We also entered into a long-term trademark license agreement with GE that enables GE HealthCare to continue building upon our brand.\nCOMPETITORS\nThe global medical technology industry is highly competitive and includes global and regional participants of all sizes that can vary by product line. Because of the diversity of our products and offerings, we face a wide variety of competitors, including a broad range of manufacturers, third-party distributors, and service providers. In the industries we serve, we believe our primary global competitors include Siemens Healthineers, Philips Healthcare, Canon, Mindray, and United Imaging, among others. In our PDx business segment, we primarily compete with Bayer, Bracco, Guerbet, and Curium. We also both compete and partner with various digital health and healthcare AI participants.\nWhile key competitive factors and trends vary among our segments, these typically include value, quality and performance, safety, delivery speed, service and support, technology and innovation, software offering, and brand reputation.

We hold our suppliers to the same rigorous operating standards. Our supply chain design drives resilience and redundancy, including maintaining buffer capacity, diversifying our sourcing and manufacturing bases, and utilizing advanced risk-focused analytics. \nREGULATION\nREGULATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.\nThe development, manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products are subject to stringent government regulation globally. We commit extensive resources to maintain compliance with these regulations.\nThe U.S., European Union (“EU”), and China are our most significant regions based on revenue and the regulatory landscape within these regions. The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the United States, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) (for pharmaceuticals) and European National Competent Authorities and Notified Bodies (for devices) in Europe, the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) in China and other government agencies, such as state and local authorities, in the United States, Europe, and China, administer strict requirements governing the design, development, testing, performance, safety, quality, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale, servicing, marketing, and post-market surveillance of medical products, including medical devices and pharmaceutical products. In addition, we are subject to applicable national and sub-national laws and regulations of other countries.\nOur ability to market and sell our products globally depends upon our compliance with the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we develop, manufacture, or distribute our products. This requires, among other things, compliance with laws and regulations related to developing, testing, conducting clinical trials if needed, and receiving appropriate marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to commercialization of our products where necessary. We are also subject to extensive laws and regulations requiring ongoing compliance and monitoring of our products throughout the product lifecycle. For example, we have extensive processes and procedures for monitoring the post-market safety and performance of our products, reporting applicable events to regulators, and taking action to address potential safety or quality concerns where needed. In addition, regulators across the globe have the authority to conduct periodic inspections of our facilities, products, and Quality Management System processes and procedures to evaluate our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Regulators also monitor our advertising and promotion of products for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nComplying with requirements imposed on our products and business is an ongoing process as we introduce additional products and/or product modifications and seek to comply with changing legal and regulatory requirements. The time required to obtain authorization to market and sell products varies by country. The ability to comply with global post-market requirements requires extensive and ongoing resources. An enforcement or adverse action by a regulator could limit our ability to obtain regulatory authorizations or impact our ability to develop, market, distribute, or otherwise make our products available, depending on the nature of the action.\nDATA PRIVACY LAWS.\nDue to our extensive global footprint and handling of personal data as both a data controller (on our own behalf) and data processor (on behalf of third parties, primarily customers), we are also subject to an extensive collection of global laws and regulations protecting the privacy, security, and integrity of the personal data, sensitive personal data, and patient health information that we create, receive, use, and maintain as a business.\nAmong the most relevant and material to our business, based on the volume and sensitivity of the data at issue, are: the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively “HIPAA”); the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”), similar U.K. legislation resulting from the European Union (Withdrawal) Data Act of 2018 (“U.K. GDPR”), and other EU country-level laws; the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoias (“Brazil LGPD”); the various laws and accompanying regulations in China governing data privacy and cybersecurity (e.g., the Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China, Personal Information Protection Law (“China PIPL”) & Data Security Law (“China DSL”)), the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of India, and significant privacy legislation recently adopted in the Middle East and Africa Personal Data Protection Law (“PDPL”) Royal Decree No. M/19 on September 16, 2021. In addition, there are also various U.S. state-level laws (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), country regional laws, and proposed legislation that we monitor for applicability and impact to our business. These laws present a continuing challenge to businesses to structure their data collection, storage, use, and cross-border transmission in a compliant manner.\n10\nMany of these laws impose a significant compliance burden on organizations within their scope, and failure to comply can result in a variety of sanctions, including, with respect to GDPR, administrative fines for the most serious compliance failures up to 4% of a company’s global total annual revenue of the preceding fiscal year. While there have been some recent enforcement actions by EU country-level data protection authorities resulting in substantial fines pursuant to GDPR, there remains uncertainty as to how data protection authorities throughout the rest of the globe will choose to interpret and enforce violations of applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., Brazil LGPD, China PIPL). Furthermore, these laws and regulations are continuously evolving, and further clarification in the form of implementing rules, guidelines, and related guidance from the data protection authorities is necessary to understand the full picture of the compliance obligations imposed on businesses within their scope. Additionally, in recent years, the EU has introduced upcoming legislation that would regulate the use and transfer of non-personal, technical data only.\nGLOBAL HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE.\nThe marketing, promotion, and sale of medical devices, drugs, and services are regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and comparable U.S. state and non-U.S. governments and agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of the delivery of healthcare items and services, representing government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Industry trade associations (such as Advanced Medical Technology Association (“AdvaMed”) and MedTech) increasingly provide guidance on applicable laws and regulations.\nU.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or our customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals, and healthcare fraud and abuse. Similar state false claims, anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and insurance laws also apply to state-funded Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payers. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and colleagues to criminal and civil financial penalties and expose us to civil liability and risk of further enforcement action under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the False Claims Act (“FCA”), or other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-cleared and -approved devices and drugs reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), which requires us to annually track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians and other healthcare professionals or U.S. teaching hospitals. Similar laws exist in some U.S. states as well.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to or otherwise engaging in bribery of government officials. These laws apply to many of our customer interactions, as healthcare professionals in other countries are often considered government officials, and in some cases lay out requirements of how to operationalize compliance with the legal requirements. Countries outside the United States have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed in those countries.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”)\nPage\nTrends and Factors Impacting Our Performance\n39\nSummary of Key Performance Measures\n40\nResults of Operations\n41\nResults of Operations – Segments\n44\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n45\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n50\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n52\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n52\n38\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and corresponding notes (the “financial statements”) included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis provide information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial results of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. and its subsidiaries (“GE HealthCare,” the “Company,” “our,” “us,” or “we”) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances; see “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and particularly in Item 1A,\n \n“Risk Factors.”\nOn January 3, 2023, the General Electric Company, which now operates as GE Aerospace (“GE”), completed the spin-off of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (the “Spin-Off”). For further information regarding the Spin-Off, refer to Note 1, “Organization and Basis of Presentation.”\nThe following tables are presented in millions of United States (“U.S.”) dollars unless otherwise stated, except for per-share amounts which are presented in U.S. dollars. Certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts, and unless otherwise stated, represent changes year-over-year.\nEffective July 1, 2024, Image Guided Therapies, previously part of the Imaging segment, was realigned to the Ultrasound segment to better match its clinical usage and realize stronger business and customer impact by providing the right image guidance in the right care setting. The Ultrasound segment was subsequently renamed Advanced Visualization Solutions (“AVS”). Following this realignment, the Company continues to have four reportable segments: Imaging, Advanced Visualization Solutions, Patient Care Solutions (“PCS”), and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (“PDx”). These segments have been identified based on the nature of the products sold and how the Company manages its operations. Historical segment financial information presented within this report has been recast to conform to the new reportable segments structure. For additional information on the nature of our business and our segments, refer to Item 1, “Business” and Note 4, “Segment and Geographical Information.”\nTRENDS AND FACTORS IMPACTING OUR PERFORMANCE\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and particularly in Item 1A,\n \n“Risk Factors.”\nKEY TRENDS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nRussia and Ukraine Conflict\nWe had $162 million and $153 million of assets in, or directly related to, Russia and Ukraine as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, none of which are subject to sanctions that impact the carrying value of the assets. We generated revenues of $363 million, $340 million, and $395 million from customers in these two countries for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The potential inability to repatriate earnings from these two countries will not have a material impact on our ability to operate.\nWe continue to monitor the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the consideration of financial impact, cybersecurity risks, the applicability and effect of sanctions, and the employee base in Ukraine and Russia. Under the current U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, we are permitted to export, re-export, or transfer medical equipment and spare parts that meet stated criteria under a License Exception, which has eliminated the need for us to obtain individual U.S. licenses in most cases; however, licenses still may be needed for some transactions. The European Union and other countries have also expanded licensing requirements for certain spare parts, services, software, and other items. We will continue to apply for licenses to supply to these customers and to support our business in Russia, as required. The implementation of these measures affected our ability to supply customers in Russia during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and will continue to do so as we confirm applicability of the U.S. License Exception to our transactions and continue to obtain licenses. There is no guarantee we will obtain all of the licenses for which we applied, that any approvals we obtain will be on a timely basis, or that our business in Russia will not be further disrupted due to evolving legal or operational considerations. The Board, together with management, will continue to assess whether developments related to the conflict have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on the Company.\n39\nChina Market\nWe continue to monitor developments in the market in China. In March 2024, the government in China announced a new stimulus program (“2024 stimulus”) that includes the healthcare sector and is being implemented through China’s provinces. In addition, an anti-corruption campaign directed at the healthcare sector remains ongoing. Both of these factors contributed to delayed orders and sales in our China business throughout 2024. We expect the 2024 stimulus program will result in opportunities for our business in China in the longer term, but it has had a short-term impact as provinces develop and announce their plans and customers begin to make purchasing decisions. We expect the effects of the delay in the 2024 stimulus and the anti-corruption campaign to continue to impact our orders and sales in the near term, although we are unable to predict the exact duration or magnitude of the impact. We expect both of these impacts to be temporary, and we believe the focus of government policy in China on expanding access to healthcare will benefit our business in China in the long term.\nTariffs\nIn February 2025, the United States imposed additional tariffs on products from China. These tariffs, and any future tariffs, including on products from Mexico or Canada, by the United States or other countries, will likely result in additional costs to us. The impact of tariffs will depend on various factors including the timing, amount, scope, and nature of the tariffs, and any mitigating actions we implement.\nTax Valuation Allowances\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by evaluating all available positive and negative evidence. We have a valuation allowance against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets and will release the valuation allowance when there is sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, “Income Taxes.”\nSeasonality\nOur revenues and operating profits vary from quarter to quarter. Financial results in the fourth quarter have historically been higher than in other quarters due to the spending patterns of our customers. \nOPERATION AS A STAND-ALONE COMPANY. \nFinancial Presentation Under GE Ownership\nGE HealthCare utilized allocations and carve-out methodologies through the date of the Spin-Off to prepare historical combined financial statements. The combined financial statements herein for periods prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of our future performance, do not necessarily include the actual expenses that would have been incurred by us, and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, stand-alone company during the historical periods presented. For additional information, see Note 1, “Organization and Basis of Presentation.”\nStand-Alone Company Expenses \nAs a result of the Spin-Off, we are subject to federal and state securities laws and stock exchange requirements. We have established additional procedures and practices as a stand-alone public company. As a result, we have and will continue to incur additional costs related to external reporting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, Board of \nDirectors and officers, and stock administration. \nCompensation \nWe have instituted competitive compensation policies and programs as an independent public company. The expense for these policies and programs increased from the compensation expense allocated by GE in years prior to the Spin-Off, driven primarily by higher cash and stock compensation to retain employees and align more closely with industry peers.\nSUMMARY OF KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nManagement reviews and analyzes several key performance measures including Total revenues, Operating income, Net income attributable to GE HealthCare, Earnings per share, and Cash from (used for) operating activities. Management also reviews and analyzes Organic revenue*, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes* (“Adjusted EBIT*”), Adjusted net income*, Adjusted tax expense*, Adjusted effective tax rate* (“Adjusted ETR*”), Adjusted earnings per share*, and Free cash flow*, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reviewed and analyzed in order to evaluate our business performance, identify trends affecting our business, allocate capital, and make strategic decisions, including those discussed below. See “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion on our key performance measures.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures, a discussion of why we believe they are useful to management and investors as well as certain of their limitations, and reconciliations to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures are provided below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n____________________\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n40\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for each of the periods presented.\nConsolidated and Combined Statements of Income\nFor the years ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSales of products\n$\n13,075\n$\n13,127\n$\n12,044\nSales of services\n6,597\n6,425\n6,297\nTotal revenues\n19,672\n19,552\n18,341\nCost of products\n8,271\n8,465\n7,975\nCost of services\n3,196\n3,165\n3,187\nGross profit\n8,205\n7,922\n7,179\nSelling, general, and administrative\n4,269\n4,282\n3,631\nResearch and development\n1,311\n1,205\n1,026\nTotal operating expenses\n5,580\n5,487\n4,657\nOperating income\n2,625\n2,435\n2,522\nInterest and other financial charges – net\n504\n542\n77\nNon-operating benefit (income) costs\n(406)\n(382)\n(5)\nOther (income) expense – net\n(55)\n(86)\n(62)\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes\n2,581\n2,361\n2,512\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n(531)\n(743)\n(563)\nNet income from continuing operations\n2,050\n1,618\n1,949\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n—\n(4)\n18\nNet income\n2,050\n1,614\n1,967\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(57)\n(46)\n(51)\nNet income attributable to GE HealthCare\n$\n1,993\n$\n1,568\n$\n1,916\nTOTAL REVENUES.\nRevenues by Segment\nFor the years ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n % change\n2023 vs. 2022\n % change\n2024 vs. 2023\n % organic*\n change\n2023 vs. 2022\n % organic*\n change\nSegment revenues\nImaging\n    \n$\n8,855\n$\n8,944\n$\n8,395\n(1)%\n7%\n(1)%\n8%\nAVS\n    \n5,131\n5,094\n5,012\n1%\n2%\n1%\n3%\nPCS\n    \n3,125\n3,142\n2,916\n(1)%\n8%\n—%\n8%\nPDx\n    \n2,508\n2,306\n1,958\n9%\n18%\n9%\n18%\nOther\n(1)\n     \n52\n66\n60\nTotal revenues\n    \n$\n19,672\n$\n19,552\n$\n18,341\n1%\n7%\n1%\n8%\n(1) Financial information not presented within the reportable segments, shown within the Other category, represents HealthCare Financial Services which does not meet the definition of an operating segment.\nRevenues by Region\nFor the years ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n % change\n2023 vs. 2022\n % change\nUnited States and Canada (“USCAN”)\n    \n$\n8,981\n$\n8,551\n$\n8,130\n5%\n5%\nEurope, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”)\n    \n5,051\n5,058\n4,684\n—%\n8%\nChina region\n    \n2,360\n2,785\n2,531\n(15)%\n10%\nRest of World\n    \n3,280\n3,158\n2,996\n4%\n5%\nTotal revenues\n    \n$\n19,672\n$\n19,552\n$\n18,341\n1%\n7%\n____________________\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n41\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nTotal revenues were $19,672 million\n, \ngrowing 1% or $120 million\n. The reported growth was largely due to Sales of services increasing \n3%\n or $\n172\n million primarily driven by increased pricing.\nThe segment revenues were as follows:\n•\nImaging segment revenues were $8,855 million, decreasing 1% or $89 million, following high single-digit revenue growth in the prior year, with current year impacts from lower sales volume in China and unfavorable foreign currency impacts;\n•\nAVS segment revenues were $5,131 million, growing 1% or $37 million with an increase in sales volume in USCAN partially offset by lower sales volume in China and unfavorable foreign currency impacts;\n•\nPCS segment revenues were $3,125 million, decreasing 1% or $17 million primarily due to decreased volume in the Monitoring Solutions product line following growth in the prior year and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by increased volume in the Maternal Infant Care product line; and\n•\nPDx segment revenues were $2,508 million, growing 9% or $202 million with growth in the USCAN and EMEA regions driven by growth in volume, an increase in price, and new product introductions.\nThe regional revenues were as follows:\n•\nUSCAN revenues were $8,981 million, growing 5% or $430 million with growth across all segment revenues;\n•\nEMEA revenues were $5,051 million, flat to the prior year, following high single-digit growth in the prior year, with growth in PDx revenues largely offset by decreases in Imaging and PCS revenues;\n•\nChina region revenues were $2,360 million, decreasing 15% or $425 million with declines in all segment revenues following double-digit growth in the prior year due to the impact from the 2022 COVID stimulus programs, and current year sales impacted by the delayed 2024 stimulus and the ongoing anti-corruption campaign; and\n•\nRest of World revenues were $3,280 million, growing 4% or $122 million with growth in all segment revenues, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nTotal revenues were $19,552 million\n, growing 7% or $1,211 million as reported and 8% organically*.

Organic revenue* grew 3% primarily due to growth in the CardioVascular and Interventional Solutions product line due to new product introductions, an increase in price, and supply chain fulfillment improvements;\n•\nPCS segment revenues were $3,142 million, growing 8% or $226 million due to growth in Monitoring Solutions and Consumables and Services product lines driven by an increase in price and operational improvements; and\n•\nPDx segment revenues were $2,306 million, growing 18% or $348 million with growth across all regions due to an increase in price and improved demand.\nThe regional revenues were as follows:\n•\nUSCAN revenues were $8,551 million, growing 5% or $421 million due to growth in PCS, PDX, and Imaging revenues;\n•\nEMEA revenues were $5,058 million, growing 8% or $374 million due to growth in Imaging and PDx revenues;\n•\nChina region revenues were $2,785 million, growing 10% or $254 million due to growth across all segment revenues, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts; and\n•\nRest of World revenues were $3,158 million, growing 5% or $162 million due to growth in PDx, Imaging, and AVS revenues, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.\n____________________\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n42\nOPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GE HEALTHCARE, ADJUSTED EBIT*, AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME*.\nFor the years ended December 31\n2024\n% of Total revenues\n2023\n% of Total revenues\n2022\n% of Total revenues\n2024 vs. 2023\n % change\n2023 vs. 2022\n % change\nOperating income\n    \n$\n2,625\n13.3%\n$\n2,435\n12.5%\n$\n2,522\n13.8%\n8%\n(3)%\nNet income attributable to GE HealthCare\n1,993\n10.1%\n1,568\n8.0%\n1,916\n10.4%\n27%\n(18)%\nAdjusted EBIT*\n3,211\n16.3%\n2,956\n15.1%\n2,861\n15.6%\n9%\n3%\nAdjusted net income*\n2,060\n10.5%\n1,797\n9.2%\n2,103\n11.5%\n15%\n(15)%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nOperating income was $2,625 million, an increase of $190 million and 90 basis points as a percent of Total revenues. The increase was due to the following factors: \n•\nGross profit increased $283 million or 120 basis points as a percent of Total revenues primarily due to a reduction in Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold decreased $194 million or 120 basis points as a percent of Sales of products. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity, favorable mix within our product offerings, and an increase in pricing of our products, partially offset by cost inflation. Cost of services sold increased $31 million but decreased 80 basis points as a percent of Sales of services. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our service offerings, partially offset by cost inflation. Included in our total cost of revenue as part of our product investment was $405 million in engineering costs for design follow-through on new product introductions and product lifecycle maintenance subsequent to the initial product launch, compared to $438 million for the \nprior year comparable period\n; and\n•\nTotal operating expenses increased $93 million, with an increase in R&D investments of $106 million and a decrease in Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense of $13 million primarily driven by cost saving initiatives, including information technology, largely offset by increased restructuring spend. As a result, R&D as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 50 basis points and SG&A as a percentage of Total revenues decreased by 20 basis points.\nNet income attributable to GE HealthCare and Net income margin were $1,993 million and 10.1%, an increase of $425 million and 210 basis points, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:\n•\nOperating income increased $190 million, as discussed above;\n•\nInterest and other financial charges – net decreased $38 million primarily driven by repayments made on the Term Loan Facility;\n•\nNon-operating benefit income increased $24 million primarily related to the amortization of net gains on our pension plans;\n•\nOther income – net decreased $31 million primarily driven by favorable impacts from Net financing and investment income in the prior year driven by impacts from the revaluation of investments; and\n•\nProvision for income taxes decreased $212 million primarily due to the release of the France valuation allowance partially offset by the establishment of a reserve for ongoing audits in France. In the prior year, there were larger non-recurring impacts from the Tax Matters Agreement with GE as well as an incremental charge for the accrual of withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of earnings. For additional detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, “Income Taxes.”\nAdjusted EBIT* and Adjusted EBIT margin* were $3,211 million and 16.3%, an increase of $255 million and 120 basis points, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Gross profit, partially offset by investment in R&D.\nAdjusted net income*\n \nwas $2,060 million, an increase of $263 million primarily due to an increase in Gross profit and lower Interest and other financial charges – net, partially offset by investment in R&D.\n____________________\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n43\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nOperating income was $2,435 million, a decrease of $87 million and 130 basis points as a percent of Total revenues. The decrease as a percent of Total revenues was due to the following factors:\n•\nCost of products sold increased $490 million but decreased 170 basis points as a percent of Sales of products. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our products, partially offset by cost inflation. Cost of services sold decreased $22 million or 130 basis points as a percent of Sales of services. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our service offerings, partially offset by cost inflation. Included in our total cost of revenue as part of our product investment was $438 million in engineering costs for design follow-through on new product introductions and product lifecycle maintenance subsequent to the initial product launch, compared to $429 million for the \nprior year comparable period\n; and\n•\nTotal operating expenses increased $830 million due to an increase in SG&A expense of $651 million driven by increased costs associated with both the one-time stand-up and recurring operations of a stand-alone company and commercial and marketing investments and an increase in R&D investments of $179 million. As a result, SG&A as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 210 basis points and R&D as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 60 basis points.\nNet income attributable to GE HealthCare and Net income margin were $1,568 million and 8.0%, a decrease of $348 million and 240 basis points, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:\n•\nOperating income decreased $87 million, as discussed above;\n•\nInterest and other financial charges – net increased $465 million primarily due to interest expense related to the debt securities issued by GE HealthCare in November of 2022 and the Term Loan Facility drawn upon in January of 2023;\n•\nNon-operating benefit income increased $377 million primarily related to the pension plans transferred to GE HealthCare as part of the Spin-Off; and\n•\nProvision for income taxes increased $180 million primarily due to t\nhe tax effect of foreign currency movement, the impact of the Tax Matters Agreement, including the effect of completing the 2022 U.S. federal tax return\n, taxes accrued for the future repatriation of current earnings with a one-time charge for prior period earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and the impact of adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities to stand-alone GE HealthCare tax rates. For additional detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, “Income Taxes.”\nAdjusted EBIT* and Adjusted EBIT margin* were $2,956 million and 15.1%, an increase of $95 million but a decrease of 50 basis points, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Total revenues, offset by an increase in Total operating expenses, excluding the impact of one-time Spin-Off and separation costs, as discussed above.\nAdjusted net income*\n \nwas $1,797 million, a decrease of $306 million primarily due to higher Interest and other financial charges – net, partially offset by an increase in Operating Income, excluding the impact of one-time Spin-Off and separation costs, as discussed above.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n–\n SEGMENTS\nWe exclude from Segment EBIT certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments that our Chief Operating Decision Maker (which is our Chief Executive Officer) considers to be non-operational, such as Interest and other financial charges – net, Benefit (provision) for income taxes, restructuring costs, acquisition and disposition-related benefits (charges), Spin-Off and separation costs, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, gain (loss) on business and asset dispositions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and investment revaluation gain (loss).

When read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses and can be used by management as one basis for making financial, operational, and planning decisions. Descriptions of the reported non-GAAP measures are included below.\nWe report Organic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate to provide management and investors with additional understanding and visibility into the underlying revenue trends of our established, ongoing operations, as well as provide insights into overall demand for our products and services. To calculate these measures, we exclude the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nWe report EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings per share to provide management and investors with additional understanding of our business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors, on a normalized basis. To calculate these measures we exclude, and reflect in the detailed reconciliations below, the following adjustments as applicable: Interest and other financial charges \n–\n net, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, Benefit (provision) for income taxes and certain tax related adjustments, and certain non-recurring and/or non-cash items. We may from time to time consider excluding other non-recurring items to enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted EBIT margin is calculated by taking Adjusted EBIT divided by Total revenues for the same period.\nWe report Adjusted tax expense and Adjusted ETR to provide management and investors with a better understanding of the normalized tax rate applicable to our business and provide more consistent comparability across periods. A\ndjusted tax expense excludes the income tax related to the pre-tax income adjustments included as part of Adjusted net income and certain income tax adjustments, such as adjustments to deferred tax assets or liabilities. We may from time to time consider excluding other non-recurring tax items to enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted ETR is Adjusted tax expense divided by income before income taxes less the pre-tax income adjustments referenced above.\nWe report Free cash flow to provide management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis and provide insight into our flexibility to allocate capital\n. Free cash flow is Cash from (used for) operating activities – continuing operations including cash flows related to the additions and dispositions of property, plant, and equipment (“PP&E”) and additions of internal-use software.\n Free cash flow does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the capital required for debt repayments.\nManagement recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes. In order to compensate for the discussed limitations, management does not consider these measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure are provided below, and no single financial measure should be relied on to evaluate our business.\n45\nOrganic Revenue*\nFor the years ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n% change\nImaging revenues    \n$\n8,855\n$\n8,944\n(1)%\nLess: Acquisitions\n(1)\n    \n47\n—\nLess:

We have historically generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, we have access to revolving credit facilities of $3,500 million in aggregate, described in detail in Note 9, “Borrowings.”\nWe believe that our existing balance of Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, future cash generated from operating activities, access to capital markets, and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our current and ongoing operations, pay taxes due, service our existing debt, and fund investments in our business for at least the next 12 months.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nCash Flow\nFor the years ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash from (used for) operating activities – continuing operations\n$\n1,955 \n$\n2,101 \n$\n2,134 \nCash from (used for) investing activities – continuing operations\n(914)\n(558)\n(398)\nCash from (used for) financing activities – continuing operations\n(573)\n(478)\n(822)\nFree cash flow*    \n1,554 \n1,715 \n1,828 \nOperating Activities\nCash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,955 million and included Net income from continuing operations of $2,050 million, non-cash charges primarily for depreciation and amortization of $580 million, and $675 million in outflows from incremental changes in assets and liabilities, primarily driven by company-funded benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans, an increase in receivables due to higher volume, and a build in inventories.\nCash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2,101 million and included Net income from continuing operations of $1,618 million, non-cash charges primarily for depreciation and amortization of $610 million, and $127 million in outflows from incremental changes in assets and liabilities, primarily driven by company-funded benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and an increase in receivables, partially offset by lower cash taxes paid and a decrease in inventories.\nCash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2,134 million and included Net income from continuing operations of $1,949 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $633 million, and a $448 million outflow from changes in assets and liabilities, primarily driven by an increase in both inventories and receivables, and higher cash taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 was $914 million and primarily included additions to PP&E of $401 million related mostly to manufacturing capacity expansion and new product introductions, purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $313 million related to the MIM Software Inc. (“MIM Software”) and Intelligent Ultrasound Group PLC acquisitions, and payment of $94 million for settlement of cross-currency swaps that were designated in net investment hedges.

Refer to Note 9, “Borrowings” for further information.\nCash used for financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $478 million and primarily included $1,317 million of transfers to GE, $850 million partial repayment of our outstanding Term Loan Facility, and $211 million of redemption of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $2,000 million drawdown of the Term Loan Facility.\nCash used for financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 was $822 million and primarily included $8,934 million of transfers to GE, partially offset by $8,198 million of newly issued debt.\nFree cash flow*\nFree cash flow* was $1,554 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and primarily included $1,955 million of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $401 million of cash used for additions to PP&E.\nFree cash flow* was $1,715 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and primarily included $2,101 million of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $387 million of cash used for additions to PP&E.\nFree cash flow* was $1,828 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and primarily included $2,134 million of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $310 million of cash used for additions to PP&E.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash used for capital expenditures was $401 million, $387 million, and $310 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing capacity expansion, new product introductions, and equipment and tooling for new and existing products.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under lease, debt, and other commitments are provided in Note 7, “Leases,” Note 9, “Borrowings,” and Note 14, “Commitments, Guarantees, Product Warranties, and Other Loss Contingencies.” We have material cash requirements related to our pension obligations as described in Note 10, “Postretirement Benefit Plans.”\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nAdditional information on our debt and credit facilities, including definitions of the terms used below, is included in \nNote 9\n, \n“Borrowings.” \nAs part of our capital structure, we have incurred debt. The servicing of this debt is supported by cash flows from our operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had $8,951 million of total debt compared to $9,442 million as of December 31, 2023\n. This includes a \n$1,000 million a\nggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued by the Company in the third quarter of 2024, and a repayment in the fourth quarter of 2024 of \n$1,000 million\n of senior unsecured notes. \nThe decrease in debt was due primarily to repayments of \n$150 million\n and \n$250 million\n of the outstanding Term Loan Facility in the first and fourth quarter of 2024, respectively.\nThe weighted average interest rate for the Notes and our Credit Facilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 5.99%.\nIn addition to the Term Loan Facility, our credit facilities include a five-year senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $2,500 million expiring in January 2028, and a 364-day senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $1,000 million expiring in December 2025. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, there were no outstanding borrowings on either of the two revolving facilities.\nThe Credit Facilities include various customary covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of liens securing debt, the entry into certain fundamental change transactions by GE HealthCare, and the maximum permitted leverage ratio. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements, including the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio. \nAccess to Capital and Credit Ratings\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we accessed the capital markets and raised $10,250 million of debt by issuing \n$8,250 million\n of senior unsecured notes in November 2022, completed a drawdown of the Term Loan Facility of \n$2,000 million\n in January 2023, and arranged $3,500 million of revolving credit facilities to further support our liquidity needs. In the third quarter of 2024, we issued \n$1,000 million\n aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2029. We plan to continue to rely on capital markets, and we expect to have access to credit facilities to fund our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing will be influenced by our credit ratings and market conditions. Moody\n’\ns Investors Service (\n“\nMoody\n’\ns\n”\n), S&P Global Ratings (\n“\nS&P\n”\n), and Fitch Ratings (\n“\nFitch\n”\n) currently issue ratings on our long-term debt. \n____________________\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n51\nOur credit ratings as of \nFebruary 6, 2025\n are set forth in the table below and remain unchanged since the Spin-Off.\nMoody’s\nS&P\nFitch\nLong-term rating\nBaa2\nBBB\nBBB\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nWe are disclosing our credit ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity.

We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nTo prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Business Combination Related Measurements, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Income Taxes. \nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for further information on our significant accounting policies.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION.\nOur revenues are recorded based on the consideration specified in customer contracts net of any sales incentives, discounts, returns, chargebacks, group purchasing organization fees, rebates, or credits, which are accounted for as estimated variable consideration. Our estimates for these deductions are based upon historical experience and consider current and forecasted market trends. We record the estimated amounts as a reduction to revenue when we recognize the related product or service sale. \nChargebacks are a form of variable consideration that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the contracted customer. A provision for outstanding chargebacks is recorded at the time we recognize revenue from the sale to the wholesaler and requires certain estimates such as the wholesaler chargeback rates, the expected sell-through levels by our wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. \nThe amounts of variable consideration included in the net transaction price for revenue recognition are limited to the amounts that are estimated to be probable of occurrence to avoid a material revenue reversal in a future period. \nSee Note 3, “Revenue Recognition” for further information on revenue recognition and Note 5, “Receivables” for further information on chargebacks.\nBUSINESS COMBINATION RELATED MEASUREMENTS. \nOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the combination. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration we may be liable to pay in the future, are recorded on the date of the business combination at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Our business combinations typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology, and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense. The fair values of acquired intangible assets and liabilities are determined using information available at the business combination date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable. Significant assumptions vary by the class of asset or liability and the valuation technique used. These assumptions can include: the discount rates; timing; probability of achieving regulatory and commercialization milestones; and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, growth rates, royalty rates, and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage third-party valuation specialists who review our critical assumptions and prepare the calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant business combinations.\n52\nSee Note 8, “Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets” for further information on our business combinations.\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.\n \nPension and other postretirement benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and related asset and liability measurement. The Company evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. The Company periodically evaluates other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover, and updates them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. \nProjected benefit obligations (“PBO”) are measured as the present value of expected payments. We discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the expected timing of benefit payments. \nA 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have the following effects on the calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2025 and PBO and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) as of December 31, 2024:\nDiscount Rate Sensitivity\nU.S. Plans\nInternational Plans\nOther Postretirement Plans\n50 bps increase in discount rate\nImpact on PBO/APBO as of December 31, 2024\n$\n(812)\n$\n(195)\n$\n(32)\nImpact on service cost and interest cost in 2025\n37 \n2 \n3 \n50 bps decrease in discount rate\nImpact on PBO/APBO as of December 31, 2024\n$\n885 \n$\n215 \n$\n33 \nImpact on service cost and interest cost in 2025\n(43)\n(3)\n(2)\nThe sensitivity of the net deficit to the discount rate would be lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity as a result of the liability hedging program incorporated in the plan’s asset allocation.\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. In developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and abroad. We evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields, and spreads, using both internal and external sources. We also consider expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. A 1% change in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the 2025 net periodic benefit costs of these plans by $194 million.\nOur pension plan assets contain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. While the majority of these assets are valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets, the fair value of certain assets is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These assets primarily relate to real estate and private equity investments.\nFor pension benefits and retiree health and life benefits transferred from GE on January 1, 2023, third-party actuaries were engaged to assist in the valuation of transferred pension assets and liabilities using assumptions provided by GE which the Company reviewed prior to recording amounts in our combined financial statements.\nWe disclose in the following table postretirement plans with assets or obligations that exceed $50 million as of December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 10, “Postretirement Benefit Plans” for further details related to these plans. The value of the assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024, are summarized in the table below.\nProjected benefit obligations\nFair value of plan assets\nFunded status - surplus (deficit)\nGE HealthCare Pension Plan\n$\n15,230 \n$\n13,650 \n$\n(1,580)\nGE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan\n1,886 \n— \n(1,886)\nOther U.S. Pension Plans\n1,125 \n727 \n(398)\nTotal U.S. Plans\n18,241 \n14,378 \n(3,863)\nInternational Plans\n2,957 \n3,276 \n319 \nOPEB Plans\n(1)\n1,016 \n— \n(1,016)\nTotal\n$\n22,214\n \n$\n17,654\n \n$\n(4,561)\n(1) As defined in Note 10, “Postretirement Benefit Plans.”\n53\nINCOME TAXES.\nFor periods prior to the Spin-Off, GE HealthCare is included in the combined U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns of GE, where eligible. However, we have adopted the separate return method for purposes of our combined financial statements. The income tax provisions reflected in our combined financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2022 have been estimated as if we were a separate taxpayer. \nOur annual tax expense is based on our income, applicable statutory tax rates, and tax incentives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly impact the estimate of our tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years to the extent applicable, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates; we use our historical experience as well as our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Our policy is to adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the change in the technical merit of a position, or an uncertain tax position is effectively settled with the relevant taxing authority, or the statute of limitations has expired. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these changes; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. \nSee Note 11, “Income Taxes” for further information on income taxes.",
