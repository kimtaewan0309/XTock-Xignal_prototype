See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page \n86\n for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. \nTHE COMPANY\nIn a world shaped by increasingly interconnected risks, Moody's data, insights, and innovative technologies help customers develop a holistic view of their world and unlock opportunities. With a rich history of experience in global markets and a diverse workforce of approximately 16,000 across more than 40 countries, Moody's gives customers the comprehensive perspective needed to act with confidence and thrive. Moody’s has two reportable segments: MA and MIS.\nMoody's Analytics\nMoody's Investors Service\nMA provides data, intelligence and analytical tools to help business and financial leaders make confident decisions.\nFor more than 115 years, MIS has been a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and risk analysis helping businesses, governments, and other entities around the globe.\nMA is comprised of: i) a premier fixed income and economic research business (Research & Insights); ii) a data business powered by the world’s largest database on companies and credit (Data & Information); and iii) three cloud-based subscription businesses serving banking, insurance and KYC workflows (Decision Solutions).\nMIS publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nMoody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, contingencies, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, pension and other retirement benefits, investments in non-consolidated affiliates, and income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Item 7, MD&A, in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, includes descriptions of some of the judgments that Moody’s makes in applying its accounting estimates in these areas. Since the date of the annual report on Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates disclosures other than the update below relating to the Company's assessment of goodwill for impairment.\nGoodwill \nAt July 31st of each year, Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., MA and MIS), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment).\nPrior to 2025, MA's reporting unit structure consisted of \ntwo\n reporting units comprised of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and CRE solutions. During the first quarter of 2025, MA reorganized its management and reporting structure, which affected the composition of the reporting units within the MA reportable segment. As a result, MA's reporting unit structure now consists of \none\n reporting unit, which is consistent with the segment's current management structure and operating model. This reorganization did not result in a change to the Company's reportable segments. The Company performed assessments of the reporting units impacted by the reorganization immediately before and after the reorganization became effective and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\n45\nTable of Contents\nSubsequent to the aforementioned reorganization of the MA reporting unit structure, the Company now has three reporting units: two within the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations) and one reporting unit within MA.\nAt July 31, 2025, the Company performed qualitative assessments for each of the three reporting units. These qualitative assessments resulted in the Company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company is organized into two reportable segments as of September 30, 2025: MA and MIS, which are more fully described in the section entitled “The Company” above and in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following footnotes are applicable throughout the discussion of the Company's results of operations:\n(1) \nRefer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" of this MD&A for the definition and methodology that the Company utilizes to calculate this metric.\n(2)\n Refer to the section entitled \"Key Performance Metrics\" of this MD&A for the definition and methodology that the Company utilizes to calculate this metric.\nThree months ended September 30, 2025 compared with three months ended September 30, 2024\nExecutive Summary\nThe following table provides an executive summary of key operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. Following this executive summary is a more detailed discussion of the Company’s operating results as well as a discussion of the operating results of the Company’s reportable segments.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nFinancial measure:\n2025\n2024\n% Change Favorable\n(Unfavorable)\nInsight and Key Drivers of Change Compared to Prior Year\nMoody's total revenue\n$\n2,007\n \n$\n1,813 \n11 \n%\n— reflects revenue growth in both segments \nMA external revenue\n$\n909\n \n$\n831 \n9 \n%\n— sustained demand for insurance and KYC offerings;\n— ongoing strong demand for ratings data feeds and company data applications; and\n— continued demand for credit research product offerings\n— Organic constant currency revenue\n(1)\n growth was 6%  and ARR\n(2) \nincreased 8%\nMIS external revenue\n$\n1,098\n \n$\n982 \n12 \n%\n— strong investor demand and tight credit spreads supported revenue growth in all ratings LOBs, led by:\n— an increase in leveraged finance issuance (which includes bank loans and speculative-grade bonds); and       \n— strong issuance activity from infrequent issuers in the FIG banking sector\nTotal operating and SG&A expenses\n$\n945\n \n$\n946 \n— \n%\n— a decrease in incentive compensation, which aligns with actual/projected financial and operational performance; \noffset by\n— higher salaries reflecting an increase in headcount as well as annual salary increases in both segments; \n— costs to support operating growth; and\n— an increase in charitable contributions\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n123\n \n$\n108 \n(14 \n%)\n— higher amortization of internally developed software, primarily related to the development of MA SaaS solutions; and\n— amortization of recently acquired intangible assets\nRestructuring\n$\n21\n \n$\n6 \n(250 \n%)\n— relates to the Company's restructuring programs.

Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of this MD&A for further information on this financial measure.\n76\nTable of Contents\nNet cash provided by operating activities \nNet cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased by $121 million compared to the same period in 2024, with the most notable drivers reflecting:\n–\n$253 million in higher income tax payments in the current year;\n–\napproximately $100 million in higher incentive compensation payments in 2025 (based on full-year 2024 financial and operating results) compared to payments made in the prior year (based on full-year 2023 financial and operating results);\npartially offset by:\n–\ngrowth in operating income of $267 million coupled with various changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities \nThe $919 million increase in cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to:\n–\na $465 million decrease in purchases of investments, primarily due to the purchase of certificates of deposit in the prior year; and\n–\na $551 million increase in sales and maturities of investments primarily due to the maturity of certificates of deposit in the first quarter of 2025;\npartially offset by:\n–\nhigher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $117 million reflecting the acquisitions of CAPE Analytics and ICR Chile in 2025, compared to the acquisitions of GCR and Praedicat in 2024.\nNet cash used in financing activities \nThe $1,642 million increase in cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily attributed to:\n–\na $700 million repayment of notes payable in 2025; \n–\na $496 million issuance of notes in the third quarter of 2024; and\n–\n higher cash paid for treasury share repurchases in 2025 of $358 million compared to the same period in the prior year.\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments\nThe Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.3 billion at September 30, 2025 included approximately $1.7 billion located outside of the U.S. Approximately 38% of the Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in euros and GBP. The Company manages both its U.S. and non-U.S. cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to U.S. tax. The Company continues to evaluate which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the U.S. The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, the Company continues to repatriate a portion of its non-U.S. cash in these subsidiaries and will continue to repatriate certain of its offshore cash in a manner that addresses compliance with local statutory requirements, sufficient offshore working capital and any other factors that may be relevant in certain jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the Tax Act, which generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the U.S., cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes or withholding or similar taxes.\n77\nTable of Contents\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe Company's material cash requirements consist of the following contractual and other obligations:\nFinancing Arrangements\nIndebtedness\nAt September 30, 2025, Moody’s had $7.2 billion of outstanding principal on debt and $1 billion of additional capacity available under the Company’s CP Program, which is backstopped by the $1.25 billion 2024 Facility.\nThe repayment schedule for the Company’s borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2025 is as follows:\n \nFor additional information on the Company's outstanding debt, refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. \nFuture interest payments and fees associated with the Company's debt and credit facility are expected to be $4.2 billion, of which approximately $300 million is expected to be paid in each of the next five years, and the remaining amount expected to be paid thereafter.\nManagement may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which could result in higher financing costs.\nPurchase Obligations \nPurchase obligations generally include multi-year agreements with vendors to purchase goods or services and mainly include data center/cloud hosting fees and fees for information technology licensing and maintenance. As of September 30, 2025, these purchase obligations totaled approximately $700 million, of which approximately 55% is expected to be paid in the next twelve months and another approximate 45% expected to be paid over the next two subsequent years, with the remainder to be paid thereafter.\nLeases\nThe Company has remaining payments relating to its operating leases of $457 million at September 30, 2025, primarily related to real estate leases, of which $103 million in payments are expected over the next twelve months. For more information on the expected cash flows relating to the Company's operating leases, refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. \nPension and Other Retirement Plan Obligations\nThe Company does not anticipate making significant contributions to its funded pension plan in the next twelve months. This plan is overfunded at September 30, 2025, and accordingly holds sufficient investments to fund future benefit obligations. Payments for the Company's unfunded plans are not expected to be material in either the short or long-term.\nDividends and share repurchases\nOn October 21, 2025, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share for Moody’s common stock, payable December 12, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 21, 2025. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board.\nOn October 15, 2024, the Board approved $1.5 billion in share repurchase authority. At September 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $0.4 billion of remaining authority under this authorization. On October 21, 2025, the Board authorized an additional $4 billion in share repurchase authority. There is no established expiration date for the remaining authorization.\n \n78\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nAs more fully discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is currently in the process of executing the Strategic and Operational Efficiency Restructuring Program. Future cash outlays associated with this program are expected to be approximately $85 million to $115 million, which are expected to be paid out through 2027.\nSources of Funding to Satisfy Material Cash Requirements\nThe Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow over the next twelve months. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources as described above.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to its reported results, Moody’s has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as “Non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such adjusted financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These adjusted measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore, these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are brief descriptions of the Company’s adjusted financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the adjusted measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure:\n79\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin\n:\nThe Company presents Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody's operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income excludes the impact of: i) depreciation and amortization; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments, and iii) charges related to asset abandonment. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different estimated useful lives and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Restructuring charges/adjustments and charges related to asset abandonment, which the Company believes are not reflective of its ongoing operating cost structure, are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. Refer to Notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature of the Company’s restructuring programs and asset abandonment, respectively.\nManagement believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company’s operating results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue. \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperating income\n$\n917\n \n$\n738 \n$\n2,581\n \n$\n2,314 \nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization\n123\n \n108 \n356\n \n318 \nRestructuring\n21\n \n6 \n81\n \n13 \nCharges related to asset abandonment\n1\n \n15 \n4\n \n30 \nAdjusted Operating Income\n$\n1,062\n \n$\n867 \n$\n3,022\n \n$\n2,675 \nOperating margin\n45.7\n \n%\n40.7 \n%\n44.3\n \n%\n42.7 \n%\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n52.9\n \n%\n47.8 \n%\n51.8\n \n%\n49.4 \n%\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS attributable to Moody's common shareholders:\nThe Company presents Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody’s operating performance. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude the impact of: i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; iii) charges related to asset abandonment; and iv) gains on previously held equity method investments.\nThe Company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different estimated useful lives and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. These intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisition accounting and contribute to revenue generation. The amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. Restructuring charges/adjustments and charges related to asset abandonment, which the Company believes are not reflective of its ongoing operating cost structure, are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these items may vary widely across periods and companies.\nThe Company excludes the aforementioned items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted EPS from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.\n80\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet Income attributable to Moody's common shareholders\n$\n646\n \n$\n534 \n$\n1,849\n \n$\n1,663 \nPre-tax Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses\n$\n55\n \n$\n51 \n$\n163\n \n$\n148 \nTax on Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses\n(14)\n(12)\n(40)\n(36)\nNet Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses\n41\n \n39 \n123\n \n112 \nPre-tax restructuring \n$\n21\n \n$\n6 \n$\n81\n \n$\n13 \nTax on restructuring\n(5)\n(1)\n(20)\n(3)\nNet restructuring\n16\n \n5 \n61\n \n10 \nPre-tax charges related to asset abandonment\n$\n1\n \n$\n15 \n$\n4\n \n$\n30 \nTax on charges related to asset abandonment\n—\n \n(3)\n(1)\n(7)\nNet charges related to asset abandonment\n1\n \n12 \n3\n \n23 \nPre-tax gain on previously held equity method investments\n$\n—\n \n$\n(7)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(7)\nTax on gain on previously held equity method investments\n—\n \n2 \n—\n \n2 \nNet gain on previously held equity method investments\n—\n \n(5)\n—\n \n(5)\nAdjusted Net Income\n$\n704\n \n$\n585 \n$\n2,036\n \n$\n1,803 \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to Moody's common shareholders\n$\n3.60\n \n$\n2.93 \n$\n10.26\n \n$\n9.09 \nPre-tax Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses\n$\n0.31\n \n$\n0.28 \n$\n0.90\n \n$\n0.81 \nTax on Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses\n(0.09)\n(0.07)\n(0.22)\n(0.20)\nNet Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses\n0.22\n \n0.21 \n0.68\n \n0.61 \nPre-tax restructuring \n$\n0.12\n \n$\n0.03 \n$\n0.45\n \n$\n0.07 \nTax on restructuring\n(0.03)\n— \n(0.11)\n(0.02)\nNet restructuring\n0.09\n \n0.03 \n0.34\n \n0.05 \nPre-tax charges related to asset abandonment\n$\n0.01\n \n$\n0.08 \n$\n0.02\n \n$\n0.16 \nTax on charges related to asset abandonment\n—\n \n(0.01)\n—\n \n(0.03)\nNet charges related to asset abandonment\n0.01\n \n0.07 \n0.02\n \n0.13 \nPre-tax gain on previously held equity method investments\n$\n—\n \n$\n(0.04)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(0.04)\nTax on gain on previously held equity method investments\n—\n \n0.01 \n—\n \n0.01 \nNet gain on previously held equity method investments\n—\n \n(0.03)\n—\n \n(0.03)\nAdjusted Diluted EPS\n$\n3.92\n \n$\n3.21 \n$\n11.30\n \n$\n9.85 \n     \nNote: the tax impacts in the table above were calculated using tax rates in effect in the jurisdiction for which the item relates.\n81\nTable of Contents\nFree Cash Flow\n:\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital additions. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of Moody’s cash flow.

Management deems this measure to be useful in providing additional perspective in assessing the Company's revenue growth (decline) excluding both the inorganic revenue impacts from certain acquisition activity and the impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company calculates the dollar impact of foreign exchange as the difference between the translation of its current period non-USD functional currency results using comparative prior period weighted average foreign exchange translation rates and current year reported results.\nBelow is a reconciliation of the Company's reported revenue and growth (decline) rates to its organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) measures: \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions\n2025\n2024\nChange\nGrowth\n2025\n2024\nChange\nGrowth\nMCO revenue\n$\n2,007\n \n$\n1,813 \n$\n194 \n11%\n$\n5,829\n \n$\n5,416 \n$\n413 \n8%\nFX impact\n(24)\n— \n(24)\n(37)\n— \n(37)\nInorganic revenue from acquisitions\n(13)\n— \n(13)\n(45)\n— \n(45)\nOrganic constant currency MCO revenue\n$\n1,970\n \n$\n1,813 \n$\n157 \n9%\n$\n5,747\n \n$\n5,416 \n$\n331 \n6%\nMA revenue\n$\n909\n \n$\n831 \n$\n78 \n9%\n$\n2,656\n \n$\n2,432 \n$\n224 \n9%\nFX impact\n(14)\n— \n(14)\n(21)\n— \n(21)\nInorganic revenue from acquisitions\n(13)\n— \n(13)\n(38)\n— \n(38)\nOrganic constant currency MA revenue\n$\n882\n \n$\n831 \n$\n51 \n6%\n$\n2,597\n \n$\n2,432 \n$\n165 \n7%\nDecision Solutions revenue\n$\n424\n \n$\n383 \n$\n41 \n11%\n$\n1,242\n \n$\n1,114 \n$\n128 \n11%\nFX impact\n(5)\n— \n(5)\n(7)\n— \n(7)\nInorganic revenue from acquisitions\n(13)\n— \n(13)\n(38)\n— \n(38)\nOrganic constant currency Decision Solutions revenue\n$\n406\n \n$\n383 \n$\n23 \n6%\n$\n1,197\n \n$\n1,114 \n$\n83 \n7%\nBanking revenue\n$\n140\n \n$\n140 \n$\n— \n—%\n$\n419\n \n$\n405 \n$\n14 \n3%\nFX impact\n(1)\n— \n(1)\n(1)\n— \n(1)\nInorganic revenue from acquisitions\n(3)\n— \n(3)\n(8)\n— \n(8)\nOrganic constant currency Banking revenue\n$\n136\n \n$\n140 \n$\n(4)\n(3)%\n$\n410\n \n$\n405 \n$\n5 \n1%\nInsurance revenue\n$\n171\n \n$\n148 \n$\n23 \n16%\n$\n502\n \n$\n439 \n$\n63 \n14%\nFX impact\n(1)\n— \n(1)\n(1)\n— \n(1)\nInorganic revenue from acquisitions\n(10)\n— \n(10)\n(30)\n— \n(30)\nOrganic constant currency Insurance revenue\n$\n160\n \n$\n148 \n$\n12 \n8%\n$\n471\n \n$\n439 \n$\n32 \n7%\nKYC revenue\n$\n113\n \n$\n95 \n$\n18 \n19%\n$\n321\n \n$\n270 \n$\n51 \n19%\nFX impact\n(3)\n— \n(3)\n(5)\n— \n(5)\nConstant currency KYC revenue\n$\n110\n \n$\n95 \n$\n15 \n16%\n$\n316\n \n$\n270 \n$\n46 \n17%\nData and Information revenue\n$\n233\n \n$\n213 \n$\n20 \n9%\n$\n677\n \n$\n635 \n$\n42 \n7%\nFX impact\n(6)\n— \n(6)\n(8)\n— \n(8)\nConstant currency Data and Information revenue\n$\n227\n \n$\n213 \n$\n14 \n7%\n$\n669\n \n$\n635 \n$\n34 \n5%\n83\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions\n2025\n2024\nChange\nGrowth\n2025\n2024\nChange\nGrowth\nMA recurring revenue\n$\n875\n \n$\n789 \n$\n86 \n11%\n$\n2,549\n \n$\n2,305 \n$\n244 \n11%\nFX impact\n(14)\n— \n(14)\n(22)\n— \n(22)\nInorganic recurring revenue from acquisitions\n(12)\n— \n(12)\n(36)\n— \n(36)\nOrganic constant currency MA recurring revenue\n$\n849\n \n$\n789 \n$\n60 \n8%\n$\n2,491\n \n$\n2,305 \n$\n186 \n8%\nDecision Solutions recurring revenue\n$\n395\n \n$\n346 \n$\n49 \n14%\n$\n1,150\n \n$\n1,003 \n$\n147 \n15%\nFX impact\n(5)\n— \n(5)\n(7)\n— \n(7)\nInorganic recurring revenue from acquisitions\n(12)\n— \n(12)\n(36)\n— \n(36)\nOrganic constant currency Decision Solutions recurring revenue\n$\n378\n \n$\n346 \n$\n32 \n9%\n$\n1,107\n \n$\n1,003 \n$\n104 \n10%\nBanking recurring revenue\n$\n115\n \n$\n112 \n$\n3 \n3%\n$\n343\n \n$\n320 \n$\n23 \n7%\nFX impact\n(1)\n— \n(1)\n(1)\n— \n(1)\nInorganic recurring revenue from acquisitions\n(2)\n— \n(2)\n(7)\n— \n(7)\nOrganic constant currency Banking recurring revenue\n$\n112\n \n$\n112 \n$\n— \n—%\n$\n335\n \n$\n320 \n$\n15 \n5%\nInsurance recurring revenue\n$\n168\n \n$\n142 \n$\n26 \n18%\n$\n487\n \n$\n419 \n$\n68 \n16%\nFX impact\n(1)\n— \n(1)\n(1)\n— \n(1)\nInorganic recurring revenue from acquisitions\n(10)\n— \n(10)\n(29)\n— \n(29)\nOrganic constant currency Insurance recurring revenue\n$\n157\n \n$\n142 \n$\n15 \n11%\n$\n457\n \n$\n419 \n$\n38 \n9%\nKYC recurring revenue\n$\n112\n \n$\n92 \n$\n20 \n22%\n$\n320\n \n$\n264 \n$\n56 \n21%\nFX impact\n(3)\n— \n(3)\n(5)\n— \n(5)\nConstant currency KYC recurring revenue\n$\n109\n \n$\n92 \n$\n17 \n18%\n$\n315\n \n$\n264 \n$\n51 \n19%\n84\nTable of Contents\nKey Performance Metrics:\nThe Company presents ARR on an organic constant currency basis for its MA business as a supplemental performance metric to provide additional insight on the estimated value of MA's recurring revenue contracts at a given point in time. The Company uses ARR to manage and monitor performance of its MA operating segment and believes that this metric is a key indicator of the trajectory of MA's recurring revenue base. \nThe Company calculates ARR by taking the total recurring contract value for each active renewable contract as of the reporting date, divided by the number of days in the contract and multiplied by 365 days to create an annualized value. The Company defines renewable contracts as subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and renewable services. ARR excludes transaction sales including one-time training, services and perpetual licenses. In order to compare period-over-period ARR excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the Company bases the calculation on currency rates utilized in its current year operating budget and holds these FX rates constant for the duration of all current and prior periods being reported. Additionally, ARR excludes contracts related to acquisitions to provide additional perspective in assessing growth excluding the impacts from certain acquisition activity.\nThe Company’s definition of ARR may differ from definitions utilized by other companies reporting similarly named measures, and this metric should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. \nAmounts in millions\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\nGrowth\nMA ARR\nDecision Solutions\nBanking\n$\n466\n \n$\n436 \n$\n30 \n7%\nInsurance\n628\n \n583 \n45 \n8%\nKYC\n407\n \n351 \n56 \n16%\nTotal Decision Solutions\n$\n1,501\n \n$\n1,370 \n$\n131 \n10%\nResearch and Insights\n970\n \n899 \n71 \n8%\nData and Information\n890\n \n832 \n58 \n7%\nTotal MA ARR\n$\n3,361\n \n$\n3,101 \n$\n260 \n8%\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements located in Part I of this Form 10-Q for a discussion on the impact to the Company relating to recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCONTINGENCIES\nLegal proceedings in which the Company is involved also may impact Moody’s liquidity or operating results.
