These solutions also include security, reporting and other features that financial institutions need to process transactions for their customers.

Consistent with this focus, we continue to operate our business in accordance with the following strategic framework:\n•\nClient Relationship Value\n. We plan to increase the number and breadth of our client relationships by, among other actions: continuing to integrate our products and services; introducing new products and services that are aligned with market needs; combining products and services to deliver enhanced, integrated value propositions; and delivering quality service and support for our clients.\n•\nInnovation\n. We seek to be an innovation leader, utilizing our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our industry and enable our clients to deliver best-in-class results.\n•\nOperational Effectiveness\n. We believe we can further improve the quality of our client delivery while reducing our costs by using the opportunities created by our size and scale.\n5\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \n•\nPortfolio Management\n. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies.\n•\nCapital Discipline\n. We intend to make capital allocation decisions that offer the best prospects for our long-term growth and profitability, which may include, among other matters: internal investment; repayment of debt; repurchases of our own shares; or acquisitions.\nServicing the Market\nThe financial technology industry is highly dynamic, with new innovations entering the market and driving the expectations of our clients globally. The markets for our solutions have specific needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on quality, security, service reliability, timely introduction of new capabilities and features, flexibility and value. This requires us to continue our focus on product and service delivery, integration and innovation to meet and exceed the specific needs of our clients. We believe that our financial strength and specialized market knowledge enable us to support our clients to meet their changing preferences. In addition, we believe that our focus on quality, innovation, client service and our commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps us to identify and fulfill the needs of our clients.\nProduct Development\nTo meet the changing technology needs of our clients, we continually develop, maintain and enhance our products and systems. Our development and technology operations apply the expertise of multiple teams to design, develop and maintain specialized products and processing systems. Our products and solutions are designed to meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the international, national, regional or local market-specific merchant and financial services environments of our clients. In developing our products, we use current software development principles, such as service-oriented architecture, to create efficiencies, and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients. In addition, we use our data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) responsibly to help us create new products and services and to enhance existing ones. We currently use AI in a variety of ways, including to enable higher quality customer service experiences, platform analytics, and fraud mitigation across a number of solutions.\nResources\nOur business depends on a variety of resources to operate including products and services provided to us by third parties. For example, we rely on our human capital resources for product development (including product design and coding), sales, operations (including customer service, technology support, security and compliance) and management; access to financial and telecommunication networks; computers, servers, mainframes, microchips and other computer equipment; and Clover and other POS devices. We periodically review our resource requirements and sources, as well as our relationships with key vendors, to best meet the needs of our business including global sourcing efforts and alternate supplier resourcing. We believe we have access to the resources necessary for our current business needs. More information regarding supply chain risks can be found under the heading “Competitive and Business Risks\n”\n in the Risk Factors section of this report and our human capital resources can be found below under the heading “Human Capital.”\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our hardware, software, transaction processing services and related products as proprietary, and we use a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, internal security practices, employee confidentiality and assignment agreements, and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property assets. Our patents cover innovations relating to numerous financial software and hardware products and services, and we continue, where appropriate, to seek and secure patents with respect to our ongoing innovations. We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business.\n6\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nCompetition\nThe market for technology products and services is fragmented, highly competitive, and served by a multitude of large and small businesses. Our principal competitors include other large, integrated providers of financial services technology and payment systems, data processing affiliates of large companies, processing centers owned or operated as user cooperatives, financial institutions, merchant acquirers, ISOs, ISVs, payments companies and payment network operators. Our competitors also include global and local IT product and services companies and payment service providers and processors. We expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand or consolidate their product lines and services. Some of these competitors possess substantial financial, sales and marketing resources and can compete with us in various ways, including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing and long-standing relationships. Depending on the product or service, competitive factors may include quality, security, innovation, breadth or novelty of features and functionality, client satisfaction, market opportunity, integration, reliability, agility, global reach, multiple distribution channels, service reliability and performance standards, timely introduction of new products and features, platform scalability and flexibility, and value. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Additional information about competition in our segments is provided below.\nMerchant\nThe products and services in our Merchant segment compete with merchant acquirers and financial institutions that provide acquiring and processing services to businesses on their own. In many cases, our alliance and commercial partners, such as ISOs and ISVs, compete against each other. We also compete with merchant services providers and, in a number of countries outside of the U.S., our Merchant segment competes with a growing number of local and regional providers. In addition, payment networks and large technology, media and other integrated payments software providers are increasingly offering products and services that compete with our suite of merchant acquiring solutions.\nFinancial\nThe products and services in our Financial segment compete with large, diversified software and service companies, independent suppliers of software products, businesses that offer consumer payment solutions and a number of payment and card issuer processors. In addition to traditional payments competitors, large technology, media and other emerging financial technology providers are increasingly seeking to provide alternative payment and financing solutions. Existing and potential financial institution and other corporate clients could also develop and use their own in-house systems or custom-designed solutions instead of our products and services. In addition, we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions.\nGovernment Regulation \nOur operations, and the products and services that we offer, are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local regulations, as well as regulations outside the U.S. We are also subject to non-government-issued rules and requirements, such as those promulgated by various payment networks. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. We may also be required, among other things, to make significant additional investments to comply with rules and regulations, to modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided, or to limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate. \nFinancial Institution Regulations.\n Because a number of our businesses provide services to regulated financial institutions, we are considered to be a significant service provider under the Bank Service Company Act and, as a result, we are subject to examination by the U.S. Federal Banking Agencies, which are comprised of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We are regulated based on the uniform principles, standards, and guidance created by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”). The FFIEC is a formal interagency body empowered to standardize and promote uniformity in supervision of financial institutions. The member agencies of the FFIEC include the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which are empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial laws, some of which apply to products and services offered by our clients.\nIn the U.S., we are also subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, among other things, and in conjunction with the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation II, caps debit interchange rates for certain debit and prepaid card issuers; prohibits card issuers and payment networks from restricting the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions; requires all debit card issuers in the U.S. to participate in at least two unaffiliated debit payment card networks; prohibits payment card networks from restricting debit and prepaid card issuers from contracting with other payment \n7\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \ncard networks; and generally prohibits network exclusivity arrangements for debit card and prepaid card issuers.

In order to provide processing services, a number of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa and/or Mastercard as service providers for member institutions. A number of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are direct members or associate members of Visa and Mastercard for purposes of conducting merchant acquiring. Various subsidiaries are also processor level members of other debit and electronic benefits transaction networks or are otherwise subject to various network rules in connection with processing services and other services we provide. As such, we are subject to applicable card association, network and national scheme rules that could subject us to fines or penalties. We are subject to network operating rules promulgated by Nacha relating to payment transactions processed by us using the ACH network and to various federal and state laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity Regulations.\n We provide services that involve the collection and processing of significant amounts of data, including personal data financial data and other sensitive data which subject our offerings to various federal, state, local and foreign privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, as well as association and network privacy and cybersecurity rules, which govern, among other things, the collection, processing, storage, deletion, use and disclosure of personal information. These laws and rules contain a variety of obligations including the safeguarding of personal information, the provision of notices and use and disclosure rights. The regulations and rules are complex and evolving and can provide for significant penalties or the suspension or termination of our registrations or certifications for non-compliance, furthermore many of these regulations and rules are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could impact our business.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to various federal and state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations. The U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) requires financial institutions to explain their information sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard customer data. In some circumstances, we are subject to GLBA and we have privacy and information security obligations to our clients who are regulated by the GLBA. In certain circumstances, we are subject to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which governs the use and disclosure of protected health information in healthcare treatment, payment and operations by covered entities and their business associates. We are also subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act which empowers the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices, including those related to privacy and cybersecurity. In addition to the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC, along with the CFPB, is responsible for overseeing and enforcing the privacy and information security provisions over certain aspects of GLBA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), each of which is applicable to our businesses in certain circumstances. We also have obligations under various state privacy and cybersecurity laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which, among other things, give consumers more control over the personal information businesses hold about them. \nIn the European Union (“E.U.”) and the U.K., we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which impose a comprehensive approach to personal data protection and include penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of 20 million Euro (or 17.5 million British Pound) or four percent of a company’s consolidated global revenue. There are numerous additional privacy laws and regulations that apply to our businesses around the world which also provide for significant penalties. Some of these data protection laws, including in the E.U., Brazil, India, United Arab Emirates and China, impose requirements regarding data rights and security and either prohibit the international transfer of personal data or restrict such transfers absent lawfully recognized transfer mechanisms. There are also additional obligations that apply to us by virtue of the fact that we provide services in the financial services industry or are considered to be providing critical infrastructure to our clients including the SOCI Act in Australia, the EBA Outsourcing Requirements and the Digital Operational Resilience Act in the E.U. and the CERT-In obligations in India.\nAdditional information about privacy and cybersecurity regulation applicable to our business can be found in the Risk Factors section of this report under the heading “Regulatory and Compliance Risks”.\n8\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nMoney Transmission and Payment Instrument Licensing and Regulations.\n We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments, including some of our prepaid products. In the U.S., most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations. Many states require money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments and their agents to comply with federal and state anti-money laundering laws and regulations and often require the licensee to maintain certain levels of net worth.  \nCredit Reporting and Debt Collections Regulations.\n TeleCheck, our check acceptance business, is subject to FCRA and various similar state laws. The collection business within our subsidiary TRS Recovery Services, Inc. (“TRS”) is subject to the U.S. federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various similar state laws. TRS maintains licenses in a number of states in order to engage in collection in those states. TeleCheck and TRS are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination from the CFPB.

If we process payments for a merchant or other client in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions and incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Regulations.\n We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”). Among other things, the BSA requires money services businesses, such as money transmitters, issuers of money orders and official checks, and providers of prepaid access, to develop and implement anti-money laundering programs. Our acquiring businesses outside the U.S. are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations in the countries where they operate. Our Money Network Financial, LLC subsidiary provides prepaid access for various open loop prepaid programs for which it is the program manager and therefore must meet the requirements of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nWe are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, governments, individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Other group entities may be subject to additional local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions.\nSimilar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to OFAC lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. Our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations.\nCommunications Laws. \nWe are subject to various federal and state laws that govern telephone calls and the issuance of text messages to clients and consumers in the U.S. as well as to regulations that impose requirements on marketing emails sent to U.S residents.

Total compensation consists of a competitive base pay and annual incentive opportunity typically delivered in a mix of cash and equity that is designed to promote retention and reward the attainment of defined performance goals. We are committed to providing fair pay to our employees regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or any other protected characteristic, and we conduct pay audits to track, measure and evaluate employee compensation. In addition, throughout the year, we celebrate employee contributions and achievements through a peer-based global recognition program that enables recognition and financial rewards.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe value employee engagement and feedback. Throughout the year, we engage with our employees through events such as lunch-and-learns, quarterly all-hands meetings, town halls, leadership meetings and other forums. We encourage managers to meet regularly with their teams and encourage skip-level discussions.\nTo assess employee engagement, we periodically collect employee feedback through employee engagement surveys, including annual enterprise-wide surveys and issue-specific surveys. These surveys cover a variety of topics, such as engagement, well-being, client experience, communication, teamwork, manager effectiveness, trust and inclusion. In addition to assessing engagement, the survey results enable us to gain insight into employee perspectives and issues which we use to enhance processes, set priorities and respond to associate concerns. \nIn 2024, 94% of our associates participated in our engagement survey. The categories in which we were ranked highest were “operational excellence” and “manager effectiveness”.\nSafety and Well-Being\nWe are committed to the safety of our workforce and maintain a global safety program that is designed to protect the safety and well-being of our employees in the workplace, minimize injury and accident frequency and severity, minimize loss to property, equipment and operational disruption, and enable greater associate satisfaction and productivity.\nWe are also committed to providing comprehensive and competitive benefits to our associates that are responsive to their physical, financial, social and emotional needs. Our benefit offerings include a variety of medical and dental plan choices, mental health and counseling programs, caregiver support programs, enhanced family forming and planning resources, and paid time off. We control the cost of health care benefits for our employees despite the increased cost of such benefits to the company. Investing in our associates in this way helps us retain top talent and demonstrates our commitment to our employees, our most important asset.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.fiserv.com.

  "item7": "Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Effective in the first quarter of 2024, we realigned our reportable segments to correspond with changes in our business designed to further enhance operational performance in the delivery of our integrated portfolio of products and solutions to our financial institution clients (the “Segment Realignment”). Our new reportable segments are the Merchant Solutions (“Merchant”) segment and the Financial Solutions (“Financial”) segment. Segment results for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been recast to reflect the Segment Realignment.\nThis section generally discusses information and results pertaining to the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Information and discussion of results pertaining to the year ended December 31, 2022 not included herein can be found in Part II, “Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2024. Our discussion is organized as follows:\n \n•\nOverview\n. This section contains background information on our company and the products and services that we provide, acquisitions and dispositions, our enterprise priorities, and the trends affecting our industry in order to provide context for management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.\n26\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \n•\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\n. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. Our critical accounting policies are also summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n•\nResults of operations\n. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the consolidated and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2024 to the consolidated and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The business lines aggregated within the Financial segment consist of the following:\n•\nDigital Payments\n \n–\n provides debit card processing services; debit network services; security and fraud protection products; bill payment; person-to-person payments; and account-to-account transfers\n•\nIssuing\n \n–\n provides credit card processing services; prepaid card processing services; card production services; print services; government payment processing; and student loan processing\n•\nBanking\n \n–\n provides customer loan and deposit account processing; digital banking; financial and risk management; professional services and consulting; and check processing\nCorporate and Other supports the reportable segments described above, and consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, unallocated corporate expenses and other activities that are not considered when we evaluate segment performance, such as gains or losses on sales of businesses, certain assets or investments; costs associated with acquisition and divestiture activity; certain services revenue associated with various dispositions; and postage reimbursements. \n27\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nWe frequently review our businesses to ensure we have the necessary assets to execute our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; a way to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. The results of operations for the following acquired and divested businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition and through the respective dates of disposition.\nAcquisitions of Businesses\nOn October 9, 2023, we acquired Skytef Solucões em Captura de Transações Ltda (“Skytef”), a distributor for ISV partners and merchants of our Electronic Funds Transfer payments software. Skytef is included within the Merchant segment and expands our distribution network and POS applications. On November 1, 2023, we acquired Sled S.A. (“Sled”), a provider of instant payment solutions. Sled is included within the Merchant segment and expands our direct payment service capabilities. We acquired these businesses in Latin America for an aggregate purchase price, including hold-backs, of $17 million.\nPending Acquisitions\nIn 2024, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire CCV Group B.V. (“CCV”) and Payfare Inc. (“Payfare”). CCV is a supplier of POS payment solutions. Upon the closing of this acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, CCV will be included within the Merchant segment and is expected to expand our network of payment solutions. Payfare is a provider of program management solutions powering instant access to earnings and banking solutions for workforces. Upon the closing of this acquisition, which is subject to shareholder and court approvals and customary closing conditions, Payfare will be included within the Financial segment and is expected to expand our embedded finance capabilities. We expect these acquisitions, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $360 million, to close in the first quarter of 2025.\nDispositions of Businesses\nOn July 25, 2023, we sold our financial reconciliation business, which was reported within the Financial segment, for cash proceeds of $235 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $172 million on the sale during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOther Transactions\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) provided us with a notice of non-renewal for the Wells Fargo Merchant Services merchant alliance (“WFMS”), which is accounted for as an equity method investment. With the joint venture expected to expire on April 1, 2025, we expect to receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of our 40% ownership interest of WFMS as determined in accordance with an agreed upon contractual valuation and separation process. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a $595 million non-cash impairment as a result of an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of our equity method investment in WFMS. In connection with the expiration of WFMS, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Wells Fargo to provide processing for current and future merchant clients as well as other services to Wells Fargo’s merchant business.\nOn September 25, 2023, we acquired the remaining 49% ownership interest in European Merchant Services B.V., a Netherlands-based merchant acceptance business, for $56 million. We previously held a majority controlling financial interest in this subsidiary, which continues to be consolidated and reported within the Merchant segment.\nEnterprise Priorities\nWe aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world. Our purpose is to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. We are focused on driving growth and creating value by assembling a high-performing and diverse team; integrating our solutions; delivering operational excellence; allocating capital in a disciplined manner, including share repurchase and merger and acquisition activity; and investing for organic growth through innovation. Our long-term focus is to meet our financial commitments; continue to build high-quality revenue; deepen client relationships with an emphasis on digital solutions and value-added services; deliver innovation and integration enabling differentiated value for our clients; and generate integration value, including cost and revenue synergies from acquisitions.\n28\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nIndustry Trends\nThe global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to intensify. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience.\nMerchants\nThe rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers’ desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers nearly anywhere, through any device,  which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and flexible systems to enable them to serve customers and help manage cash flow and everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern end-to-end solutions throughout their growth lifecycle to streamline the complexity. Furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants.\nAdditionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service solution providers in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring into their software as a way to generate revenue from existing client relationships. Such providers are independent software vendors, typically referred to as ISVs, and we believe there are numerous potential distribution partnership opportunities to cross-sell multiple value-added solutions available to us.\nWe believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants. The depth and breadth of our omnichannel solutions, and flexibility to serve clients across various channels and geographies, drives higher product attach rates with new and existing clients across all verticals. Furthermore, we believe that our strength in distribution, our progress growing software and services, and our value-based pricing as we continue to invest in our operating systems, gives us a solid foundation for growth.\nFinancial Institutions\nFinancial services providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. In addition, the focus on the customer experience, including through mobile and online engagement, by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions.\nFinancial institutions must be able to serve their customers with tailored solutions, delivered how and when those customers want. In addition, financial institutions are striving for this single, integrated view of a customer’s activity. This requires financial institutions to not only process customer transactions, but to integrate financial institutions’ products and services to give customers easy access to integrated solutions. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. We have invested in integrating our platforms and value-added solutions to make it easy for a client to buy across our full product suite.\nWe expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environmental shift from traditional to digital banking. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. \nOur focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations transfer accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a \n29\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \ncontract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our value-added software and services-led model, and our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.\nRecent Market Conditions\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions, including changing interest rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, changes in consumer spending, the effects of international hostilities, political conditions, and regulations restricting trade or impacting our ability to offer products or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Personal consumption and consumer savings growth in the U.S. may also negatively impact our business and financial results. We actively monitor and manage our business in response to these unpredictable geopolitical and market conditions, as they may adversely impact our operations and financial results. \nIn addition, our operating results in certain foreign countries in which we operate may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates for currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Indian Rupee, Brazilian Real and Argentine Peso. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies in countries in which we operate would negatively impact our revenue and earnings. We also have exposure to risks related to currency devaluation in certain countries, which may negatively impact our international operating results if there is a prolonged devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar or if the economic conditions in these countries decline. While the majority of our revenue is earned in the U.S., we actively monitor the foreign exchange rate environment and may enter into derivative instruments and utilize other non-derivative hedging instruments with creditworthy institutions in an effort to manage these risks.\nThe operations of our Argentina subsidiary have experienced higher interest rates and inflation relative to historical averages. The potential benefits of higher transitory revenue from above-average interest and inflation may be offset in whole or in part by, or may be less than, foreign currency exchange losses related to a significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso.\nFor discussion of risks and potential challenges applicable to our business, results of operations and financial condition, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors.” For management’s assessment of market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency risks, see “Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.\nAcquisitions\nFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. The determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additional information regarding our acquisitions of businesses is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n30\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \nWe review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the prior test’s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. \nIn connection with the Segment Realignment, certain of our reporting units changed in composition as a result of which goodwill was allocated to such reporting units using a relative fair value approach. Our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2024 determined that our goodwill of $36.6 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of each of the respective reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value for our lowest reporting unit, which maintains a goodwill balance of $1.3 billion, was 29%. The fair value for each of our other reporting units exceeds their respective carrying value by at least 40%. However, if future operating performance is below our expectations or there are material changes to forecasted revenue growth rates or operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates, effective income tax rates, or some combination thereof, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in, and we may be required to record, a goodwill impairment charge. It is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest rate environment, a shift in strategic initiatives, or significant changes in the composition of certain of our reporting units could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. We have no accumulated goodwill impairment through December 31, 2024. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. Recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. Determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.\nProcessing and Services\nProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support.\n31\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nWe recognize processing and services revenue in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services, which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. Our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when- and if-needed basis (a stand-ready performance obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on fixed or monthly minimum processing fees. Fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis.\nProduct\nProduct revenue is generated from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily POS devices) sales. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. We sell or lease hardware (POS devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. Hardware typically consists of terminals or Clover devices. We do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. We account for the sale of distinct hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at the standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware.\nSignificant Judgments\nWe use the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, if the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.\nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances, including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, to determine whether we obtain control of goods and services prior to their transfer to a customer.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed. The transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.\nContract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract, or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of consideration to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation. Additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n32\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, including certain complexities attributed to our global footprint. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. In establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. A tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits, considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. The amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority. As additional information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and appropriately adjust our liability for known tax exposures.\nWe maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. However, there could be a significant impact to our effective income tax rate in the event there is a significant change in our judgment. To the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted as appropriate, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs. Additional information regarding our income taxes is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nComponents of Revenue and Expenses\nThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.\nProcessing and Services\nProcessing and services revenue, which comprised 81% of our total revenue in 2024, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated from these services. Cost of processing and services consists of costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data processing; facility costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.\nProduct\nProduct revenue, which comprised 19% of our total revenue in 2024, is derived from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily POS devices) sales. Cost of product consists of costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and postage; hardware costs (primarily POS devices); personnel; facility costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; third-party commissions and payments to distribution partners; marketing costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.\n33\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nFinancial Results\nThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The financial results presented below have been affected by acquisitions, dispositions, non-cash impairment charges, and foreign currency fluctuations.

The revenue increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher global processing revenue across our businesses, partially offset by a 8% decrease due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nRevenue in our Merchant segment increased $909 million, or 10%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $839 million, or 11%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Small Business contributed 8% and 9% to Merchant segment revenue growth in 2024 and 2023, respectively, driven by an increase in payment volumes in both 2024 and 2023, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Small Business revenue growth also included payment volume growth and increased hardware offerings from our Clover POS and business management platform, and the expansion of our merchant relationships through value-added services. Additionally, Enterprise contributed 3% and 2% to Merchant segment revenue growth in 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily driven by transaction growth in both 2024 and 2023, as well as new clients wins in 2024. Processing partially offset Merchant segment revenue growth in 2024.\nRevenue in our Financial segment increased $376 million, or 4%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $420 million, or 5%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Digital Payments contributed 2% and 3% to Financial segment revenue growth in 2024 and 2023, respectively, driven by an increase in transaction volume, including growth in Zelle\n®\n transactions, in both years. Digital Payments revenue growth in 2024 also benefited from transaction growth on our network routing services. Issuing contributed 1% and 2% to Financial segment growth in 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in active accounts in both years. Banking contributed 1% to Financial segment revenue growth in 2024.\nRevenue at Corporate and Other increased $78 million, or 6%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $97 million, or 8%, in 2023 compared to 2022 due to increased postage revenue in both 2024 and 2023.\nTotal Expenses\nTotal expenses increased $498 million, or 4%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 240 basis points to 71.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were favorably impacted in 2024 by operating leverage across our various businesses, as well as a reduction in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately 100 basis points. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were favorably impacted in 2023 by a $172 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our financial reconciliation business.\nCost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 32.2% in 2024 compared to 34.1% in 2023. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in 2024 by strong operating leverage accompanying scalable revenue growth.\n36\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nCost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased to 69.4% in 2024 compared to 67.5% in 2023. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2024 was impacted by revenue mix, including an increase in postage revenue.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 32.1% in 2024 compared to 34.4% in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2024 was favorably impacted by a reduction in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately 80 basis points, as well as expense management initiatives.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nTotal operating income increased $865 million, or 17%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and total operating margin increased 240 basis points to 28.7%. Total operating income and total operating margin in 2024 benefited from scalable revenue growth and productivity. Total operating margin in 2023 was favorably impacted by a $172 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our financial reconciliation business.\nOperating income in our Merchant segment increased $587 million, or 20%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $533 million, or 22%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Operating margin increased 290 basis points to 37.0% in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 310 basis points to 34.1% in 2023 compared to 2022. Operating income and operating margin growth in our Merchant segment were primarily due to operating leverage and productivity in both 2024 and 2023.\nOperating income in our Financial segment increased $307 million, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased $372 million, or 10%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Operating margin increased 140 basis points to 47.3% in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 210 basis points to 45.9% in 2023 compared to 2022. Operating income and operating margin growth in our Financial segment were primarily due to operating leverage and scalable revenue growth in both 2024 and 2023, as well as favorable vendor spend in 2024.\nThe operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $29 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and decreased $369 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The operating loss in 2023 was favorably impacted by a reduction of $191 million and $135 million in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and severance costs, respectively, compared to 2022. The operating loss in 2023 also included a $172 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our financial reconciliation business.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased $219 million, or 22%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher fixed rate outstanding borrowings associated with our public offering and issuance of $2.0 billion and $1.75 billion of senior notes in March 2024 and August 2024, respectively.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net increased $38 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Other expense, net includes the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities for subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, gains or losses from a sale or change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to debt guarantee arrangements of certain joint ventures. Other expense, net in 2024 also included a $147 million non-cash settlement charge associated with the terminations of certain defined benefit pension plans, as well as $29 million related to gains on the sale and remeasurement of certain equity securities. The remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities for subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, including Argentina, resulted in foreign currency exchange losses of $98 million and $164 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes and loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 14.2% and 19.3% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes and loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2024 included a deferred tax benefit recorded within the income tax provision associated with a non-cash impairment of certain equity method investments, primarily related to WFMS, recorded within loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes and loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2024 also included benefits associated with transferable federal tax credits, resulting in a lower effective income tax rate.\nLoss from Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nOur share of net loss from unconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method is reported as loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax benefit is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated \n37\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nstatements of income. Loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $685 million and $15 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2024 included a $595 million non-cash impairment related to the Wells Fargo Merchant Services merchant alliance.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to the minority partners’ share of the net income in our consolidated subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $49 million and $61 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNet Income Per Share - Diluted\nNet income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was $5.38 and $4.98 in 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition to the impacts to net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. described above, our diluted weighted average outstanding shares were reduced by 5% in 2024 compared to 2023, due to our share repurchase program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion, proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $2.8 billion (net of outstanding revolver borrowings and $3.2 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, senior notes due in the next twelve months and letters of credit) at December 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, and capital expenditures:\n \n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nNet income\n$\n3,180 \n$\n3,129 \n$\n51 \nDepreciation and amortization\n3,138 \n3,162 \n(24)\nShare-based compensation\n367 \n342 \n25 \nDeferred income taxes\n(662)\n(511)\n(151)\nNet gain on sale of businesses and other assets\n— \n(167)\n167 \nLoss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates\n685 \n15 \n670 \nDistributions from unconsolidated affiliates\n39 \n55 \n(16)\nNon-cash settlement charge for terminated pension plans\n147 \n— \n147 \nNet changes in working capital and other\n(263)\n(863)\n600 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n6,631 \n$\n5,162 \n$\n1,469 \n28 \n%\nCapital expenditures, including capitalized software and other intangibles\n$\n1,569 \n$\n1,388 \n$\n181 \n13 \n%\nOur operating cash flow was $6.6 billion in 2024, an increase of 28% compared with $5.2 billion in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increased profitability (excluding the non-cash settlement charge for terminated pension plans and non-cash impairments included within loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates), and corresponding cash flows, along with working capital improvements associated with receivables and payables.\nOur current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, merchant cash advances, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Net merchant cash advances, primarily associated with our operations in Latin America, were $801 million during 2024. These cash advances are funded through a combination of local operating cash and various short-term lines of credit. Our capital expenditures were approximately 8% and 7% of our total revenue in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n38\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nCash Requirements\nThe following table details our future cash requirements under certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than\n5 years\nLong-term debt, including interest \n(1) (2)\n$\n30,812 \n$\n2,025 \n$\n9,165 \n$\n6,738 \n$\n12,884 \nMinimum finance lease payments \n(1)\n699 \n238 \n339 \n101 \n21 \nMinimum operating lease payments \n(1) \n933 \n133 \n265 \n167 \n368 \nPurchase obligations \n(1)\n \n(3)\n2,181 \n872 \n880 \n275 \n154 \nUnrecognized income tax obligations\n85 \n7 \n8 \n22 \n48 \nTotal\n$\n34,710 \n$\n3,275 \n$\n10,657 \n$\n7,303 \n$\n13,475 \n(1)\nInterest, finance lease, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.\n(2)\nThe calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, except for our  3.850% senior notes due in June 2025 and 2.250% senior notes due in July 2025, and U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper notes programs as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we have the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility maturing in June 2027. The variable rate on the revolving credit facility is priced at the rate in effect at December 31, 2024.\n(3)\nRepresents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services based on signed contracts as of December 31, 2024.\nShare Repurchases\nWe repurchased $5.5 billion of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. In August 2023, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $121.98 per share in a privately negotiated transaction with ValueAct Capital Master Fund, L.P. for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. Including this transaction, we repurchased $4.7 billion of our common stock in 2023. \nOn February 19, 2025 and February 22, 2023, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 60.0 million and 75.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 18.0 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions \nAcquisitions of Businesses\nWe acquired Skytef in October 2023 and Sled in November 2023 for an aggregate purchase price, including hold-backs, of $17 million. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing available cash. The results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition. \nIn 2024, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire CCV and Payfare, which are expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, for an estimated aggregate purchase price of $360 million. \nDispositions of Businesses\nWe sold our financial reconciliation business in July 2023 for cash proceeds of $235 million. Net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to pay down indebtedness and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nOther Transactions\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Wells Fargo provided us with a notice of non-renewal for WFMS. With the joint venture expected to expire on April 1, 2025, we expect to receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of our 40% ownership interest of WFMS as determined in accordance with an agreed upon contractual valuation and separation process.\nIn September 2023, we acquired the remaining 49% ownership interest in European Merchant Services B.V., in which we previously held a majority controlling financial interest in this consolidated subsidiary, for $56 million. We funded this transaction by utilizing a combination of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.\n39\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nIndebtedness\nOur debt consisted of the following at:\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nShort-term and current maturities of long-term debt:\nForeign lines of credit\n$\n784 \n$\n442 \nFinance lease and other financing obligations\n326 \n313 \nTotal short-term and current maturities of long-term debt\n$\n1,110 \n$\n755 \nLong-term debt:\n2.750% senior notes due July 2024\n$\n— \n$\n2,000 \n3.850% senior notes due June 2025\n900 \n900 \n2.250% senior notes due July 2025 (British Pound-denominated)\n661 \n672 \n3.200% senior notes due July 2026\n2,000 \n2,000 \n5.150% senior notes due March 2027\n750 \n— \n2.250% senior notes due June 2027\n1,000 \n1,000 \n1.125% senior notes due July 2027 (Euro-denominated)\n521 \n555 \n5.450% senior notes due March 2028\n900 \n900 \n5.375% senior notes due August 2028\n700 \n700 \n4.200% senior notes due October 2028\n1,000 \n1,000 \n3.500% senior notes due July 2029\n3,000 \n3,000 \n4.750% senior notes due March 2030\n850 \n— \n2.650% senior notes due June 2030\n1,000 \n1,000 \n1.625% senior notes due July 2030 (Euro-denominated)\n521 \n555 \n5.350% senior notes due March 2031\n500 \n— \n4.500% senior notes due May 2031 (Euro-denominated)\n835 \n889 \n3.000% senior notes due July 2031 (British Pound-denominated)\n661 \n672 \n5.600% senior notes due March 2033\n900 \n900 \n5.625% senior notes due August 2033\n1,300 \n1,300 \n5.450% senior notes due March 2034\n750 \n— \n5.150% senior notes due August 2034\n900 \n— \n4.400% senior notes due July 2049\n2,000 \n2,000 \nU.S. dollar commercial paper notes\n221 \n418 \nEuro commercial paper notes\n1,239 \n1,321 \nRevolving credit facility\n115 \n74 \nUnamortized discount and deferred financing costs\n(150)\n(145)\nFinance lease and other financing obligations\n656 \n652 \nTotal long-term debt\n$\n23,730 \n$\n22,363 \nIn August 2024, we completed the public offering and issuance of $1.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due in March 2030 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.150% senior notes due in August 2034.

Interest on our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our Euro and British Pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. Interest on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper notes is generally paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion. \nAt December 31, 2024, the 3.850% senior notes due in June 2025 and 2.250% senior notes due in July 2025 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis, and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper programs are also classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance this commercial paper on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper upon maturity, and also have the ability to refinance such commercial paper under our revolving credit facility.\nVariable Rate Debt \nOur variable rate debt consisted of the following at December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\nMaturity\nWeighted-Average Interest Rate\nOutstanding Borrowings\nForeign lines of credit\nvarious\n31.695%\n$\n784 \nU.S. dollar commercial paper notes\nvarious\n4.534%\n221 \nEuro commercial paper notes\nvarious\n3.115%\n1,239 \nRevolving credit facility\nJune 2027\n5.440%\n115 \nTotal variable rate debt\n12.856%\n$\n2,359 \nWe maintain various short-term lines of credit and other borrowing arrangements with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund merchant settlement advances associated with operations in Latin America.

Net merchant cash advances during 2024 were $801 million. As we collect a portion of the corresponding receivables from card issuers over several months, in the event we are unable to continue to borrow in the Argentina overnight market, we may fund future advances with our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and available capacity under our revolving credit facility.\nWe maintain unsecured U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs with various maturities generally ranging from one day to four months. Outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs bear interest based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance.\nWe also maintain a senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, which matures in June 2027 and provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of availability of $6.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable base rate, determined by the term and currency of the borrowing, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $115 million at December 31, 2024. We are required to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the credit agreement from time to time.\nDebt Covenants and Compliance\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at the applicable redemption price.\nThe revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times our consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. Our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants.\nDebt Guarantees\nWe maintain noncontrolling ownership interests in Sagent M&C, LLC and defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (collectively, the “Lending Joint Ventures”). The Lending Joint Ventures maintain variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $421 million in senior unsecured debt at December 31, 2024 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in April 2027. There were $35 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2024. We have guaranteed the debt of the Lending Joint Ventures. We maintained a liability of $21 million at December 31, 2024 for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. In addition, we maintained a contingent liability of $15 million at December 31, 2024, representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so, and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. \nOther\nAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance maturing debt and fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2024, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. As of December 31, 2024, we had a commercial paper credit rating of P-2 from Moody’s and A-2 from S&P.\nThe interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes and commercial paper notes programs are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease \n42\nTable of Contents\n                                 \n \nbelow investment grade, the per annum interest rates on certain senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nInvestments, exclusive of settlement assets, with original maturities of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets. \nThe table below details our cash and cash equivalents held at:\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nAvailable\n$\n665 \n$\n450 \nUnavailable \n(1)\n571 \n754 \nTotal \n$\n1,236 \n$\n1,204 \n(1)\nRepresents cash held by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors of the relevant entity declares a dividend, as well as cash held by other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements.",
